<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak about a matter which a distinguished lawyer has raised with me. It concerns the response from Mr Dennis Rose QC, an eminent QC from the Attorney-General's Department, which was made during a hearing before the Senate Select Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Mr Geoff Petersson became most concerned when a person of Mr Rose's eminence passed what he saw as a slighting remark about his professional ability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised this matter with Senator Cooney, who is the chairman of the committee. He tells me that the committee will be producing a report shortly, but cannot specify the exact date. It is right and proper that the record be put straight as soon as possible and I feel correction cannot await the uncertain date of the report. Accordingly, I now take steps to put the record straight for the benefit of Mr Petersson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter that was sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs relating to its reference on the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the hearing of the Committee in relation to the above reference on Thursday 9 September 1993, during the course of his giving evidence, Mr Dennis Rose may have, perhaps inadvertently, misled the Committee when referring to a submission to the Committee prepared by me on behalf of the Taxation Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At page 15 of the transcript Mr Rose is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Mr Morris talked of the opinions that have been given and the opinions by Dr Howard and himself and Mr Petersson. I suppose one can regard that last one as the Taxation Institute opinion. I am not aware of Mr Petersson having any expertise in constitutional law. It may be that he does but I am not aware of it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it surprising that Mr Rose could have stated that he was not aware whether I had any expertise in constitutional law given that I have worked closely with Mr Rose over the 17 years in which I worked as a lawyer in the Attorney-General's Department between 1972 and 1989. During that time I held various senior positions in the then Advisings Division (now Office of General Counsel) working within that Division in the Constitutional and Financial Branch, the Constitutional, Broadcasting and Administrative Branch, and the Constitutional and Electoral Branch. During that period I spent two years as Principal Legal Officer, Assistant to the Solicitor-General assisting in the preparation of cases and opinions, many involving </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">questions of constitutional law. During the time I spent in the Advisings Division, Mr Rose held positions of Branch Head and Divisional Head. On more than one occasion, Mr Rose and I occupied adjacent offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is fair to say that by any measure I have had considerable experience in dealing with, and advising on constitutional law matters over a long period of time. Whether this experience may be said to give rise to expertise in constitutional law is another matter. However, Mr Rose's response implies that he is unaware as to whether I have had experience in advising on constitutional issues. This is clearly not so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would respectfully request that your Committee's report should note my concern.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to highlight a couple of points here about the accountability, the spending, the functioning and the operations of ATSIC. The first issue brought to my attention&mdash;which, I am told, is fairly typical of what is happening in many instances&mdash;revolves around an effort by a group of Aboriginals to develop a business in a country town in Western Australia. I will not name that country town because people will know who I am speaking about and those individuals could be put under some unfair pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That group endeavoured to get assistance through ATSIC to purchase a tyre business in which they had worked for a number of years in conjunction with the owner, who wished to sell the business. After some 18 months of effort, toing-and-froing and not being able to get satisfactory answers as to what had happened to their application, how it was being accounted for and how it was being processed, finally, that particular operator had to sell the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me to be not quite right that a group of Aboriginals, who were totally self-supporting but who needed some capital assistance to give themselves the opportunity to become commercially viable in their own business, was denied that assistance purely and simply because of the financial management and accountability processes within ATSIC. Even to this day, as far as I am aware, they have not received a satisfactory answer to their problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other points I wish to raise in this debate come from some documents which were given to me&mdash;or to use the commonly used term from the newspaper, were leaked to me&mdash;just last week. They refer to the operations of ATSIC in Western Australia. I find the issues I raise particularly despicable and disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has some 1,300 Aboriginal families currently seeking assistance to get into their own homes or to get a roof over their heads. These documents were presented at the meetings of ATSIC commissioners from 9 to 12 August 1993. We see in terms of community housing development that of the $48.6 million allocated to Western Australia for Aboriginal housing, only $40.8 million was spent. One must ask, when you have a situation where, as I said, there are some 1,300 Aboriginal families currently seeking to get their own homes or a roof over their heads, why $8 million was returned to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put on the public record that I believe that three most important things in dealing with Aboriginal problems or concerns that we have in this nation are housing, health and education. The first is housing. I think it is absolutely imperative that this particular aspect be addressed in a sensitive and fair manner and that it be done in such a way that it caters not only for the community Aboriginals who, basically, live in the north or central Australia, but also for regional Aboriginals and for those termed `fringe dwellers'. I do not particularly like that term, but that is the term that is used consistently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was recently reported that in Kalgoorlie one-third of the Aboriginals under the age of 40 had passed on in the last 18 to 20 months. We can see that this question of housing is, indeed, a very important one. It is something that I believe this committee could look at in terms of accountability, functions and expenditure, and in terms of why, when we have this serious situation in Western Australia, this money was returned to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the housing situation. In order of importance, the next matter is health. I believe that housing and health are linked inextricably together. Next on my list is education. These documents highlight that of the $11.7 million which was allocated for health in Western Australia, $700,000 was not spent. Substance abuse is another problem that, unfortunately, the Aboriginals have had to deal with. Some $1.4 million was spent in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin are major Mabo bids. This document shows quite clearly the government's position as far as Aboriginals are concerned. The emphasis is not on the matters that I raised, which are very important and which Aboriginal people consistently bring before me and Senator Panizza and other colleagues of mine in Western Australia. This document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided that;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the $10 million is to be removed from the Commission's global allocation in 1994-95 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say something which I find absolutely disgraceful:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Atsic may retain the $10 million as part of the Commission's contribution to the Mabo response IF:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the Ministers for Finance and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs can:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) Define activities on which the funds can be spent; and</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the Commission accepts that Mabo expenditure within ATSIC's budget would not be limited to the earmarked $10 million.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this highlights very clearly the importance of this inquiry. First of all, we are seeing the government directing that $10 million be taken out of ATSIC's global allocation, which could and would be spent on such things as housing, health and education, and holding a gun at its head, threatening, `Unless you spend the money this way, we will take it away from you. You will not get it'. The government is hiding behind ATSIC and trying to make ATSIC the bad boy for what I believe in many instances to be the false expectations that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has built up around the Mabo decision. I emphasise that for the vast majority of Aboriginals there are far more important things than Mabo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I grew up in a country district and spent the whole of my primary school career attending a school at Bindi Bindi, where there were more Aboriginal children than there were children of European origin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this motion by Senator Panizza is not only important but crucial. It is not only Senator Panizza who is asking for this reference, supported by his colleagues; it is also many Aboriginal people who feel that they are being misled and thwarted by some of the things that have been happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They cannot understand why in Western Australia, for example, as I have mentioned, when those 1,300 people want to get a home, a roof over their head, that $8 million is returned to the Commonwealth. They cannot understand why in terms of the operations of ATSIC&mdash;and I must say in its original format the only basis on which I personally supported it was that it would give Aboriginals some independence, a say in how they sorted out their destiny&mdash;we see the government through the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) saying, `Unless you spend this $10 million on Mabo related claims, burn it up with lawyers and in the legal processes'&mdash;in most instances for little or no return&mdash;`we will take the money away from you'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister. Just to put my own thoughts in perspective, I will reiterate some of my opening remarks with regard to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993. The stated purpose of the original Development Allowance Authority Bill 1992 was unclear other than to encourage expenditure on the lease of new capital or the upgrading of existing capital in certain large enterprises. It must be remembered that the cost of imported capital has already decreased as a result of decreases in tariffs. Employment creation was obviously not a criterion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth legislation claimed that the allowances were for industries with an effective rate of assistance of less than 10 per cent. Up until 2 September 1993, 80 per cent of projects registered are in the manufacturing and mining sectors. To give honourable senators an idea of what the allowance was meant for, let me quote the One Nation statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government wishes to build on this advantage and promote an early upturn in investment in new plant and equipment for projects which offer particular benefits for Australia's competitiveness in world markets.</PARA>
<PARA>The broad criteria intended to identify such projects relate to the absence of any substantial assistance or protection. This was mentioned in relation to the rate of assistance being less than 10 per cent. The broad criteria state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.positive facilitation by State and local governments in relation to such matters as project approval processes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>For that read fast-tracking&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and, where appropriate, the economic and efficient pricing of inputs under the control of public utilities and statutory marketing authorities. Where a need for similar or complementary action at the Commonwealth level is identified, it will be taken</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.employers and employees committing to management and industrial relations arrangements which promote the achievement of world best practice.</PARA>
<PARA>How does this link with the states actually work? In Western Australia it came out in a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The WA Advantage</EMPHASIS>. I was somewhat horrified at the time because, according to that report those projects which would be disadvantaged would be the ones that would not receive special attention and administrative assistance. Those were projects with a capital investment of less than $50 million; those employing less than 100 people&mdash;that is, the majority of Australian businesses; those producing for the local market; and those not requiring significant infrastructure to be provided by the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the major rubs. The state government in Western Australia, in linking with the Commonwealth legislation, said, of the projects to be identified, that one of the identifying criteria was the creation of significant infrastructure which was required by the state. That is assistance, but somehow or other it did not get added in. If, as part of the criteria, the state were required to provide cheaper inputs like electricity and water, that is also assistance, but this somehow or other did not get added into the 10 per cent. The other criterion was that those people who were disadvantaged were those who were not requiring an environmental clearance, including many who were helping to repair the environmental damage. The other people who were disadvantaged by this package were those not impacting on Aboriginal reserves, national parks or areas of major land use conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way it worked in Western Australia was that the Commonwealth legislation worked in with Western Australian legislation which actually singled out large, imposing projects which had major environmental impacts or major impacts on Aboriginal land, or which required large amounts of state government assistance. The way the actual legislation worked in Western Australia was contradictory. In other words, apart from fast tracking and reduced tariffs on electricity and water in Western Australia, the selection criterion was that the community had already contributed to the projects' infrastructure costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering that in Western Australia there are already a number of other built-in subsidies, such as reduced royalties, it would appear that the development allowance has already defeated its own purpose. In other words, this so-called development allowance is operated as a job shedding subsidy to industries which are already heavily subsidised by the community, even without costing in the environmental costs of such subsidies. In the absence of any real information that such an allowance is not simply allowing large corporations to benefit even more at the expense of employment, the Greens (WA) senators cannot support the expansion of this scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1993 is to extend the development allowance to projects in the motor vehicle and printing production industries. Somewhat surprisingly, there is a further amendment to this amendment bill to extend the proposed definition of the `ancillary printing plant' to include units placing inserts into magazines, newspapers and periodicals&mdash;an amendment which, to the cynical eye, has all the elements of pressure from particular vested interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be aware that the principal act had its genesis in the February 1992 One Nation statement. The development allowance measure currently before the Senate provides a tax deduction of 10 per cent on eligible plant during the first year of installation or use. The allowance is in addition to the generous depreciation allowances. Eligible projects must have a capital cost of over $50 million and be approved by a special statutory authority called the Development Allowance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's objective at the time was to provide an incentive to promote an early upturn in investment, especially in the state-of-the-art technology involving new plant and equipment and, thus, the shedding of jobs&mdash;in summary, projects which offered benefits to improve Australia's competitiveness in world markets. That was the theory through the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even then, in 1992, the Liberal-National Party coalition had a number of difficulties with the original bill. Firstly, it discriminated against projects with a capital cost of less than $50 million. Secondly, it did nothing for investment in plant and equipment in the poorest areas of the economy&mdash;those that need fixing. But due to its haste of passage and shortly after its enactment, the principal act, not surprisingly, was amended because it was too restrictive. It needed to allow a greater flexibility to permit the aggregation of two or more joint venture projects involving new and existing plant. In other words, it was so hastily conceived that it was unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A change was effected to permit a combination of long-term lease arrangements with short-term owned equipment. We have before the Senate today an amendment to the proposed amendment to extend the allowance to include the motor vehicle industry and the print media. We are extending it even further to allow installations to include the newspaper folding machines so that these big newspapers can get a bigger segment of the advertising market; they will be able to compete with others because their costs of production will be much more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of June 1993, registered projects were worth something like $14.5 billion. That might appear to be a significant figure but, compared with the estimate, it fell far short of the original figure. While the government is still confident&mdash;this government is always confident&mdash;of reaching the much touted figure of $130 billion, the attainment of such a venturous goal is dependent on the overall level of confidence in the global economy. That is certainly beyond the par of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The next two years do not indicate an environment of strong growth to sustain such an optimistic outcome. We are used to predictions of optimistic outcomes and the subsequent revelation of those outcomes not being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the election campaign, the Prime Minister gave great prominence to the impact of this alleged $130 billion investment that would bring in the much needed recovery. In fact, the new measures introduced in the amendment bill originated during the heat of the 1993 election campaign when the Prime Minister, in desperate measures, was determined to try to woo back the business vote to his government. Mr Keating believed that a sharp reduction in the corporate tax rate to 33 per cent, plus an extension of the development allowance to include the motor vehicle industry and the print media, would catch the corporate vote. But we have now found that there has been a bit of a sting to the 33 per cent corporate tax rate because it has created a whole lot of anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those anomalies are giving rise to further pieces of legislation which will shortly be debated in the Senate. They include draconian measures to tighten up fringe benefits; one will have to spend $1.27 to get a $1 deduction. There are a lot of inconsistencies. The issues have not been thought through and this is one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to use the second reading debate to foreshadow a committee stage amendment whereby the Liberal-National Party coalition, in a sense of fairness and equity, will be seeking to remove the $50 million threshold&mdash;a threshold that excludes small business from this very generous concession which is being granted to the larger corporations involving the publication and the print industry. As explained earlier, in addition to the normal depreciation deduction, qualifying corporations are entitled to an extra deduction equal to 10 per cent of the eligible expenditure before the determination of taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good taxation law requires an adherence to the concept of neutrality and equality in that, in the determination of taxable income, all taxpayers in the same industry should be entitled to the same deductions and they should be assessed on the same taxable income. But it is not so. This government positively discriminates against the smaller operators and positively discriminates in favour of the big barons. This amendment is all about giving a special concession&mdash;a special benefit&mdash;to those entrepreneurs big enough to spend $50 million plus in greenfield development that will make them world competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are these industries in the print media&mdash;I will exclude the motor vehicle industry because I think it has an entitlement because it is starting to export&mdash;going to do to our export income? How much income is generated from the overseas sale of big Australian newspapers in a particular year compared with the income generated from the iron, coal, wheat, wool and other industries? It is a special concession to the vested interests of those who have been able to get to the ear of some prominent people in government. It is quite unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal-National coalition seeks to take away this discrimination. I am horrified that the smaller parties cannot see the fairness of this particular scheme. Are they in favour of the small person? Are they in favour of small business? After all, these are the areas which are keeping people in employment. It is the big firms that are shedding the jobs. I do not mind companies becoming more internationally competitive, but let it be in terms of the legislation that we put before this house, a house which supposedly looks after people's interests, neutrality, fairness and equality. We should make sure that when we pass legislation it will reflect that degree of fairness and not give a competitive edge to the big players vis-a-vis the small players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament rightly recognises that there are special circumstances for disadvantaged people&mdash;the poor and the needy&mdash;and these taxpayers need special consideration. But in this bill there is a deliberate discrimination in favour of the rich and powerful who will be able to use this generous tax concession to further improve their profits and their market share as against the smaller operators who are competing. I think the opposition's amendment that I am foreshadowing, which removes that threshold, deserves support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is positive assistance through the tax mechanism, the larger corporations will be able to reduce their unit costs and improve their competitive position over the smaller and generally less financially secure firms. Admittedly, if this amendment is successful, they will have to move very fast because of the time constraints. But at least it would let us give the right appearance and let them have the opportunity, if they can move, to take advantage of a concession that is given to the rich and powerful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope the Senate will endorse the amendment proposed by the opposition in the interests of equity and fairness and not give an advantage to those who are already in a powerful state. After all, this amendment defies the original intent to make industry world competitive in order to increase export income. The government would be moving against one of the very important tenets that helped get it elected&mdash;that is, to make Australian industry world competitive. I urge the Senate to support the amendment that I now foreshadow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that a number of the earlier benchmarks have been revised to accommodate the new entrants. This is where it differs significantly from the original One Nation proposal. Those benchmarks were removed admittedly as a result of pressure during the heat of an election campaign. Both the motor car industry and the print media were previously excluded from the development allowance in the 1992 legislation because they failed the eligibility test in the principal act. The mechanics of the matter are that both industries now have until either 30 December 1993 or 28 days after this act receives royal assent, whichever is the latter, to lodge the application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admitted during my speech on second reading that if the Senate accepts this amendment, the smaller operators will have to act pretty speedily. So the concept that was raised in the very thoughtful contribution of my colleague Senator McMullan was that it would cause a problem for the deficit, et cetera. There will not be too many people who will be in a position to actually take advantage of this situation. Again, it is a question of fairness. So I remind the Senate that the initiatives will assist the development of greenfield site projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such amendments should be viewed with suspicion by the smaller operators, particularly in the printing industry, who will see their share of the market eroded as a further result of the lower costs of production by those who have access to capital and who now have access to this very generous concession&mdash;a concession that is not available to the smaller, though maybe entrepreneurial, more successful competitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is trying to further entrench the newspaper and other print media in the hands of what I might call an entrepreneurial elite. The problem I see with this amendment and another reason why we believe it is fair and equitable to extend it to all people to ensure that we do not give a positive discrimination in favour of the entrepreneurial elite is the criterion of contributing to export income. The government has deliberately removed such a benchmark&mdash;it was admirable in the One Nation statement&mdash;to suit particular vested interests.

<PARA>The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill 1993 and the three cognate bills provide for the legal regime that will enable Australia to become part of the International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution. While the Greens (WA) are not opposing the legislation, we are moving this amendment to the motion to express some of the concerns raised by the environment movement to the convention and the two protocols. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said before, the convention establishes a fund for the compensation of oil pollution damage. The fund has a number of problems. Firstly, the fund, even if the 1992 protocol is adopted, limits claims for compensation to $400 million. Whilst this may seem a significant amount, this is the maximum that can be claimed for any one spill. Some have estimated that the clean-up bill for the Exxon Valdez spill alone was $US3 billion. The figure of $400 million would have to cover all economic and commercial losses, as well as clean-up and remediation costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the fund defines oil pollution damage in a way that excludes compensation for non-economic loss and damage to the environment. This also excludes the possibility of Aboriginal groups claiming for loss and damage to areas of cultural and spiritual significance and for loss of natural resources for non-economic purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the convention does not establish a provision for liability by negligent acts or omissions. The convention is about compensation; it is not about prevention or liability. It does not alter the actions of shipping companies who use flags of convenience to register substandard or poorly maintained vessels, nor does it provide a disincentive for Australian based companies who profit by placing Australia's environment at risk in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) recognise that the limitations expressed above are not able to be rectified in this legislation. However, that does not mean that Australia should not try at both the national and international level to use its best efforts to protect and preserve the environment and safeguard the rights of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, we would like to acknowledge the very successful work of Australia's international negotiators in implementing the compulsory pilotage scheme in the Great Barrier Reef. The introduction, under international law, of such a regime demonstrates that Australia has a significant role to play in the development of an international regime for environmental liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add that the rest of Australia is not included in such a pilotage scheme. In Western Australia we have a very significant reef at Ningaloo which is not covered by any such pilotage. There are many other sensitive areas around Australia which suffer the same risk. It is not that pilotage itself prevents an accident, but it reduces the risk significantly. Therefore, we are not actually doing anything which will necessarily stop the risk of this happening in most parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very pleased that the government and the opposition are supporting the motion before us today. The Australian Democrats are also supporting the motion. Indeed, it was Senator Coulter, in his second reading speech on 20 May 1993, who outlined his major concerns about the convention that have resulted in this motion today. The motion picks up the major concerns outlined by Senator Coulter and we acknowledge the work of Senator Coulter on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) acknowledge also that the motion before the Senate is not as strong as it perhaps could be. We also acknowledge that part 3 of the motion mentions neither national action nor land based marine pollution. In the first part, we acknowledge the views of both the government and the opposition that Australia should not go it alone in developing a comprehensive liability regime. While we acknowledge this position, we do not support it. Rather we feel that with this motion the Senate makes it clear that Australia, and the nations of the world, must pursue at an international level the vexed question of liability for environmental harm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not mean that we will abandon attempts by organisations such as Greenpeace Australia and the Australian Conservation Foundation to promote the necessity for uniform national laws covering marine pollution from both land based and sea based sources. Indeed, it is useful to place on the record the need for such legislation and suggest that it is appropriate that the final report of the Resource Assessment Commission's inquiry into coastal zone management, soon to be presented to parliament, be given serious consideration by the government to the repeal of the various acts implemented by the Offshore Constitutional Settlement in 1980. The restriction of the motion dealing with marine based oil pollution and not land based pollution has been done to avoid any need for the matter to be referred back to cabinet due to land based marine pollution being a matter of a different department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter at issue relates to the presentation of the report to the minister. The Greens (WA) are not opposing the legislation because we realise that it is the international convention that contains the problems. We commend the amendment to the Senate and thank the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, and the shadow minister for their support on the motion. </PARA>

For those sorts of balancing reasons we have supported this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about the non-economic loss. Senator Margetts has pointed to traditional uses of the environment which may be damaged. I do not think one need even extend into the Aboriginal area how the sheer enjoyment of the environment by many people can be damaged in non-economic ways. There is no compensation within this legislation for those sorts of losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would like to make is that at the request of some of the conservation groups, I was responsible for sending this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I want to put on the record that I believe the Senate committee system, which allows people to come in and have an input into legislation at the very point at which it is being debated in this parliament, is a very important one. It is a very important part of the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in this particular case those conservation groups which had indicated an interest in appearing were rather lax in coming forward and one group failed to appear altogether. If this Senate has provided that mechanism for such groups, a mechanism that I strongly support, I think they need to recognise that the business of the Senate is complex and time consuming, and they need to respond to those opportunities. I was quite disappointed that in this particular case that opportunity was not fully taken up and accepted. Having said that, I support this amendment put by Senator Margetts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to amend the Australian Citizenship Act of 1948. Firstly, it seeks to insert a preamble, to quote the government, `giving recognition to the significance of Australian citizenship'. Secondly, it seeks to amend the citizenship act to abolish the current oath or affirmation of allegiance and to replace it with a so-called pledge of commitment. Thirdly, and consequent upon that second amendment, it seeks to remove all reference to allegiance to the Queen as head of state from the commitment made by new citizens on taking the grant of citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the last of those three objectives of the bill is concerned, this is not the first time that the Labor government has attempted to delete reference to the Crown from the oath and affirmation. It was attempted in 1973 and again in 1984. On both those occasions the attempt was defeated in the Senate. In 1984 it was defeated by the coalition with the support of the Don Chipp led Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much regret that in 1993, when this issue and this bill are again being debated, the indication is that the Australian Democrats will not be maintaining their opposition to the deletion of reference to the Crown&mdash;the centrepiece of our constitution&mdash;from the wording of the, be it called an oath or an affirmation or a pledge, that new citizens are required to make. I do hope that, in the course of this debate and before a final vote is taken on the bill, the Democrats will reconsider their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of its introduction into the parliament on 6 May this year I said, on behalf of the coalition, that we considered this bill to be premature and that it was designed to pre-empt the debate&mdash;in particular, the republican debate&mdash;on possible changes to our constitution. I stressed that so long as the Queen remains our head of state and the Crown remains the centrepiece of our constitution, new citizens should continue to be required to state publicly their allegiance to the Crown and, therefore, to the constitution and all the institutions that underpin our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate, at the coalition's initiative, referred the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration. That committee produced a divided report. The majority of the committee, being Labor senators, supported the bill. The coalition members of the committee&mdash;Senator Vanstone, Senator Kemp and Senator O'Chee&mdash;expressed their opposition. Nothing that occurred in that committee and in its public hearings has allayed the coalition's concerns about the bill or has in any way altered the coalition's formal position of total opposition to the bill at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, I emphasise that the coalition is not being negative or reactionary about the matter. We are simply saying that these matters should follow a due and orderly process of consideration. If the Australian community opts, in time, for a change in our constitutional arrangements, if in time we decide to replace our existing constitutional monarchy with some form of republican structure, that will be the time to make the relevant changes to our oath, allegiance or whatever form of words we use, but not before then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this bill, the government has put the cart before  the horse. It has done so quite deliberately. It is a deliberate, calculated attempt by a calculated, opportunistic government and Prime Minister to hijack the republican debate. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has totally misread the mood of the Australian public on this and, in his desperate push for a republic, has quickly proved himself to be the most divisive Prime Minister in Australia's history. That will come back not just to haunt him and his government; it will be of very grave concern to the future of the Australian nation and Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not have a bar of contributing to that division. I note in passing in that respect that the Australian public seems to be waking up to the Prime Minister's secret agenda on this issue. He should very carefully heed the result of the latest opinion polls on the republic issue published in today's press. A poll taken last weekend after the Olympic bid decision was announced showed a very significant swing against a republic since the last poll was taken, with a majority of Australians now favouring the retention of our present constitutional arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that issue, there are other very important reasons why the coalition is opposed to this bill. I will elaborate on these in more detail a little later. However, in summary, the citizenship act needs a total rewrite. This bill makes no attempt whatsoever to tackle the basic weaknesses and deficiencies in the act. As I say, it is essentially another attempt by the Labor Party to force the pace of the republican push and to pre-empt the outcome of the emerging debate on constitutional issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It represents a further significant weakening of the commitment required of new citizens. A `pledge'&mdash;which is the word now being used to replace the oath or affirmation which is going to be abolished&mdash;involves very much less commitment than an oath or affirmation. The wording of the proposed pledge itself is a significant weakening of the present situation. It contains no reference to the head of state, to the constitution or to any of our other basic institutions. Rather, it makes vague allusions to `Australia and its people' and contains such ambiguous concepts as `democratic beliefs'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legality of those phrases, let alone their essential meaning, has been questioned by many eminent persons. One of those who has expressed very grave concern about the changes being announced&mdash;not just in the legal sense but more particularly in the symbolic sense&mdash;is the very respected clergyman, the leader of the Anglican Church in Australia, Archbishop Peter Hollingworth. He recently wrote that what is being proposed in this bill `is a matter of deep symbolic and civic importance to us as a nation'. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is good reason for changing words or formulae if they give a wrong impression, or the original meaning has changed or if there is widespread objection based on conscience. But does the existing Oath of Allegiance offend in these ways?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The swearing of an oath goes right to the heart of human belief. To take an oath is to highlight the solemn seriousness, power and efficacy with which a person's own word becomes endowed.</PARA>
<PARA>He makes the point very well and very strongly&mdash;I will not continue with all of the article&mdash;that the changes being proposed in this bill do not represent changes for the better in that respect; that indeed they represent a `removal of significant traditional linchpins in our society without having something of like substance to put in its place'. Those words by Archbishop Hollingworth are ones that we should all heed very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position on the question of citizenship has been very clear for a long time. Our last policy statement on the matter was made in 1988 and our position has been essentially unchanged since then. We pointed out that it was essential that the requirements of acquisition and awarding of citizenship should be strengthened to ensure that intending citizens understand more fully the meaning of their commitment to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made the point then that, compared with most other countries, Australian citizenship requirements are amongst the least rigorous in the world. Indeed, it is interesting to compare them&mdash;even our existing ones, let alone the changes now being made&mdash;to, say, the United States situation. To become an American citizen, an applicant must have been physically present in the United States for at least half of the required five-year residency period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every applicant for what the Americans call naturalisation&mdash;we use the term `citizenship'&mdash;has to go through a two-stage process. First of all, the applicant has to demonstrate an understanding of the English language, including an ability to read, write and speak words in ordinary English language usage. People who are aged or who have particular disabilities are exempted from that. The applicant for citizenship has to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of the history, the principles and form of government of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the preliminary hearing, the first-stage hearing in his citizenship approach, the applicant may be represented by a lawyer or a social service agency. There is a 30-day wait after the preliminary hearing. If that preliminary hearing is favourable to the applicant, there is a final hearing before a judge, who then administers an oath of allegiance. The American oath of allegiance reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, to whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not suggesting that in Australia we follow the American wording to that extent. The point I make, though, is that a new citizen of the United States is required to make a very strong commitment. This bill seeks to remove an already insufficiently strong commitment in Australia for new citizenship. We are weakening that commitment still further and I think that is a very dangerous trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, though, the coalition has for a considerable period advocated a major overhaul of the current citizenship act to better reflect Australian citizenship as a privilege which has an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia and its basic structures and principles. We have also proposed the incorporation of a statement which spells out clearly the rights and obligations of citizenship during the citizenship ceremony in order to reaffirm that overriding and unifying commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not by any means on our own in that sense. Earlier in my speech I mentioned the words of Archbishop Hollingworth. Many other people and bodies have spoken even more directly about those issues. A very important report&mdash;the so-called FitzGerald report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Immigration&mdash;a commitment to Australia</EMPHASIS> which, I regret to say, this government has ignored&mdash;was produced in 1988 by the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies. In this very notable report the FitzGerald committee made a similar recommendation to that which the coalition has in mind. It produced a draft suggested declaration to be adopted at citizenship ceremonies, linking the grant of citizenship with respect for fundamental institutions and principles in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FitzGerald committee also recommended that ways be examined to restrict certain public benefits to non-citizens as a means of enhancing the value of citizenship. There are very considerable, difficult and sensitive issues involved in that, but I do think we need to look at ways of making citizenship more attractive to potential citizens who may be deciding whether to take up citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That FitzGerald report also recommended that a group of eminent Australians be appointed to advise on further ways of making Australian citizenship a more meaningful commitment to Australia and of encouraging its acquisition. We on this side of the chamber have always felt that that recommendation has considerable merit and that it warrants follow-up action. Accordingly, in January earlier this year the Leader of the Opposition, John Hewson, announced that a coalition government would establish a national council on citizenship to advise on a clear and unambiguous statement of the rights and obligations of citizenship in the context of a multilateral society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very important critic of the existing citizenship act has been the very eminent, very distinguished and universally respected former Governor-General of Australia, Sir Ninian Stephen. In a very important address to the Alfred Deakin Society on 26 August of this year&mdash;the Alfred Deakin lecture&mdash;Ninian Stephen described our existing citizenship act as `a masterpiece of legislative incoherence'. And he is absolutely right. The act is almost incomprehensible. It has enormous deficiencies. It does not really set out at all who are Australian citizens and what is required to be an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the only reference in the existing act to a citizen in the sense of defining who is a citizen is in section 10, which deals with citizenship by birth. That section states that someone is a citizen if that person was born in Australia after 26 January 1949, which was about the date of proclamation of the Australian Citizenship Act. Indeed, 1949 was the first time we had a citizenship act as such. In the current act the only reference to citizenship by birth occurs in section 10 and it relates only to post-January 1949 births. That is a classic example of why this act needs major change. The act is arcane, incomprehensible, unfriendly and does not set out clearly who are citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of those reasons and, in particular, the point that the bill is premature at this time given the state of debate on our constitutional arrangements, we on the coalition side are totally opposed to this legislation. To proceed with it in advance of any change in our constitutional arrangements would be divisive, pre-emptive and of questionable legality. The citizenship act requires a complete overhaul&mdash;not the partial, piecemeal, confused, politically motivated and divisive amendments being proposed in this bill. For all of those reasons, the coalition very strongly opposes this bill in its entirety. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill seeks to replace the current oath or affirmation of allegiance with a pledge of commitment, omitting reference to the Queen in doing so. In contrast to the oath or affirmation by members of parliament, the oath for new citizens can be changed by legislation. This is what the bill seeks to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been stated, the main argument against replacing the current arrangements with a new pledge of commitment is that it is a first, and fairly significant, step towards making Australia a republic. The Australian Democrats support the move towards a republic, but that is quite different from the consideration that applies to this bill. One needs to consider whether it is appropriate at this particular time to take this step. If it were a step that affected the substance of government in Australia, I think the position that the Democrats are adopting, which essentially is one of support, would be different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view we take is that a reference to the Queen and the swearing of allegiance to the Queen in a new citizenship ceremony is somewhat of an anachronism. We believe that new citizens who have entered Australia intending to make this country their home see Australia as the country to which they swear allegiance. It is Australia that they want to make their new home. To them, I believe, reference to the Queen is of some historical interest but, in terms of everyday life, in terms of pledging their commitment to their new home country, it is not of great relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my case there is a personal element. I am probably one of the few members of this chamber who, as a newcomer to this country some time ago, has actually taken the oath. I recall that when I came in 1949 I determined very clearly and very strongly that this was going to be my new home. I applied for citizenship even before the time had elapsed that would formally have entitled me to take that step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I took the oath in 1952, I carefully considered the words. I must admit that it surprised me a little to find the reference to the Queen in that oath. I had come to Australia, I had not come to another country, and I did not expect to find the monarch of another country, even if she was called the Queen of Australia, to be the head of the community to which I was pledging my allegiance. My commitment to Australia was as strong then as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the words of the new oath have a poetic simplicity which goes back to</PARA>

<PARA>To me the words are a very noble statement. If individuals wish to add in the first line `under God`, it is their choice to do so. I believe these words are significant and represent a significant commitment on the part of new citizens. In considering the wording, and in being a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which had a reference on this matter, I felt&mdash;and the Australian Democrats felt&mdash;that it would perhaps be useful to look at a variant to emphasise more the commitment that new citizens are making. I put forward a wording which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I . . . pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I swear by Almighty God that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>In the end, after long and careful consideration, we decided that it would be difficult to improve on the words that originated from poet Les Murray's efforts, but the concern that there should be a stronger commitment to the citizenship obligations of new citizens remained. Therefore, I have moved an amendment which I understand will be supported by the government, and hopefully the opposition, the Greens and Senator Harradine, inserting the words `undertake to' in the preamble to the oath. The preamble would then read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; and</PARA>

Yesterday the issue was the UN declaration on religious freedom; today we are talking about a major change to something that is most significant to many people in this country. But, this government refuses, yet again, to take the issue to the people. I do not know what has happened to this government over the period of 10 years but it has become more and more aware of the need not to take its changes&mdash;I will not call them reforms; `reforms' suggests that something good will come out of it; they are absolute blatant changes&mdash;to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the minister at the table may well say to me, `But we had a Senate committee'. That was all very well, but the Senate committee inquiry was not held over an extended period. Most people to whom I have spoken were totally unaware of its existence. They did not have an opportunity, according to the way they view it&mdash;which is the important factor&mdash;to contribute to the debate, and here we are in a situation whereby they will be run roughshod over yet again. I just think that the whole situation is totally and utterly unsatisfactory and so do the people out there, who are the ones who will be affected by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that there are not a number of people out there who think that it might be extraordinary to pledge allegiance to the Queen. There are people out there; it would be stupid of me to the deny that. But the fact of the matter is that those very same people also find it quite extraordinary to think that they do not even have to pledge allegiance to the constitution under the proposal that has been put forward to us today. They look at comparisons with other countries. Take United States, for example, which Senator Short mentioned earlier. The situation there is very different. They have to pledge allegiance to a whole range of things, which makes this oath or affirmation look like something that would be said in kindergarten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just find that this whole thing is being treated with absolute and utter disrespect. I think it has been marginalised and minimised in terms of its importance to this country. Therefore, a very important factor that we must consider is creating opportunities for people to debate this. Let us have due consideration given to any changes that are made and not just have them rammed through the parliament in the way that this measure is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the overriding and important observations about the whole debate on the oath of citizenship is that it needs to be made more relevant to Australian society. If the government is so sure that it has the support of the public, why cannot the public be allowed to decide the nature of a solemn oath when people become new citizens of this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting that a little while ago Senator Spindler made mention of Mr Les Murray's contribution. Senator Short and I said to him that that very same man, Les Murray&mdash;the poet&mdash;now thinks that this is wrong. I will just give him what he said. Mr Murray is a poet and a former literary editor. He is best described as a poet who has an enduring admiration for the quality and sanctity of Australian rural life. He is also a man who displays such attitudes as devotion to the Australian rural scene, respect and affection for the ordinary country man, and a conviction that modern society relinquishes at its peril the values that are enshrined in the land and the lives of those who live in intimacy with it. I will quote Mr Murray&mdash;and I must emphasise that the words are not necessarily parliamentary. He said that the government has `stuffed up' his original poem by turning it into `bureaucratic gobbledegook'. They are his words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Spindler thinks that Mr Murray is still in favour of this when he uses that type of terminology, I would be awfully surprised. Mr Murray did not support the pledge in its current form and said Australians would not support Mr Keating's vision for a republic if a referendum were held now. I assume that if a referendum were held for the so-called `pledge of commitment' it would suffer a similar fate because it is so wishy-washy. Let us face it, that is part of the problem and that is the concern that is being expressed to the people of this parliament today. Mr Murray also said, `Not unless they'&mdash;Australians&mdash;`trust it'&mdash;the republic&mdash;`and they sure can't trust the one they are being offered at the moment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem that Mr Murray is identifying. That is the real crux of this issue. They do not trust what the government is doing. They do not see that it is a relevant thing to be just ramming down their throats. These are the people who will be affected, but these are the very people that this government refuses to consult. I suspect the reason the government wants to radically change the oath and affirmation through legislation is that it knows that no-one can trust the bearer of the changes. I think the question is: what is it that the government is dreading and fearful of in relation to this issue?</PARA>

If we are going to change how Australia is run&mdash;whether it is run by constitutional monarchy or as a republic&mdash;we should do it all at the same time. We should not try to get the republic in by the back door or in any other way by starting off with the oath and going on to the flag&mdash;the flag of which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was ashamed the other day in Monaco.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me return to the subject of change, and put on record&mdash;and it is public knowledge that I have done this for quite a long time with my party and anyone else who cares to listen to me&mdash;that I am very relaxed on the issue of a republic. If Australia decides to become a republic after a proper and informed referendum, I will accept that. Of course, if we change to a republic we may change the flag and if Australia wants to improve the flag after a proper referendum, I will support that. The only real condition I have on the flag is that the Southern Cross never comes off it; that was where I was born and that is where I still live. But all those things need to come after a proper debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the minister said:</PARA>

<PARA>If it has, my constituents have never heard about it. As Senator Knowles said&mdash;and she is responsible for the ethnic affairs portfolio&mdash;her constituents did not know about it. I think the Prime Minister and the government have failed to create any discussion whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go a bit further into what the government is trying to do. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Citizenship proclaims and defines national identity. The Government believes the time is right to change. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The time is right to change. The Prime Minister might think the time is right to change and so might some, but not all, of his ministers; certainly not all of his backbenchers think the time is right to change; even the Governor-General has doubts as to whether the time is right to change. Ask the people whether they think the time is right to change, not whether the Prime Minister, the government or some of its ministers think it is. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Australian Citizenship Act . . . is principally concerned about the process of acquiring . . . citizenship. This is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is it inadequate? The main thing about acquiring citizenship is taking on the obligations of Australia as well as its privileges, and do not tell me today that the present oath we have does not cover that. As I have said, there are many who were proud to take the oath in the past. I think Senator Spindler would have been happy to take it to get into a better country. Unfortunately, he had to leave his last one and as the years go by, he might have some doubts about whether he has come to a better country, but I am sure that he does not regret it, just as I do not regret it on behalf of my parents. If we are to have a change, let all Australians think about it and come up with the solution. </PARA>

As the multicultural society we are, it is proper that the pledge of commitment be one which will be equally meaningful to all our people.</PARA>

I believe it is a disgrace for a government department to fly another flag at equal height to the Australian flag. At some time I would like an explanation from the minister responsible and, if he does not believe me, he can go and have a look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is far too premature to be doing something like this. As I said before, if we are going to change the constitution, let us do it all in good time. The minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pledge calls upon applicants to make a commitment of loyalty to Australia, the nation and its people. This contrasts with the present oath or affirmation of allegiance, which is made to a sovereign by a subject and has its origins in feudal times.</PARA>

If we want to throw out anything that has its origins in feudal times, I say let us throw it all out, not selectively what the minister in charge of this bill is responsible for. If we want to use feudal times as an argument, we can go on forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to address the point that people migrating to this country demand to take a certain oath. I have not heard too many who come to Australia from republics, other kingdoms or whatever, make a demand as to the sort of oath they will take. I believe that what they want to do is become citizens of Australia for the advantages they can get from Australia, otherwise they would not have migrated here in the first place. They may have entered this country on a resident visa or with PR status, seen what sort of a country Australia is and the opportunities that are here, and decided to become citizens. I have not heard too many immigrants saying, `No, I will not become an Australian citizen because I don't like the oath of allegiance', and I believe it is a fallacy to say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take a poll on that because I believe it is a totally stupid argument.

I believe that if one wants to be admitted to a club&mdash;and I think Australia is a pretty good club to belong to; my family considers that it has been a pretty good club to belong to&mdash;one takes the rules as they are. In time, if Australia decides to change its flag, its constitution and its head of state, let it be done then, and not before, in bits and pieces and by trying to put it all over Australian citizens.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill which we are discussing in the Senate today is not a bill which in any way relates to democracy. It is not a bill which in any way relates to the will of the Australian people. It is nothing more than a blatant attempt by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) once again to impose upon the community his will, and his agenda alone. If I remember correctly no public outcry instigated this bill. There were no representations that called for changes. Rather, our Prime Minister decided that in his endeavour to push Australia towards a republic he would pre-empt any constitutional referendum and any decision of the parliament and, as usual, impose his own views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the proposed new oath and affirmation of allegiance was announced by the Prime Minister in his usual press release method, on 17 December 1992, he stated that the new oath and affirmation would better reflect the contemporary reality of Australia and our nation aspirations. It should be remembered that once again these comments were made without any public support. Naturally, when Labor was returned to government following the March 1993 election, one of the first bills to be introduced to the parliament was this Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill which, as we have heard today, deletes all reference to the Queen and any reference to the constitution or any of our other institutions from the oath of allegiance required of people on being granted Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have thought there would have been a few other higher priorities on the agenda, such as getting the budget through parliament and a few other things like that. Nevertheless, this was one of the first bills we saw after the election. If we are to judge in any way the merits of the government's proposal, I take this opportunity to place on record through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the exact wording that will be used by our new Australian citizens. It has already been quoted by Senators Knowles and it reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward, under God,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold, and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>This pledge of commitment which represents the government's proposals is an extremely poor attempt to give our new Australian citizens any understanding of what it means to be an Australian citizen. More particularly it in no way reflects the many obligations and responsibilities which accompany such an honour. There is no doubt this bill is an attempt by the Prime Minister and the Labor Party to continue their republican push and, by doing so, to pre-empt any outcome of the debate which is occurring in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As can be seen from the newspoll released today, the initial support for the republic is quickly dwindling. That is because the Australian community has had an opportunity to come to terms with what exactly it means to be part of a constitutional monarchy. According to the figures, only 39 per cent of Australian citizens support the concept and 44 per cent are against a republic. I have no doubt that this trend will continue. Our Prime Minister has absolutely no right to pretend that he represents the views of the majority of Australians on this issue. The decision by the Labor Government to delete any reference to the Queen or to our constitution from the oath of allegiance is totally unfounded whilst Australia remains a constitutional monarchy and whilst the debate which is occurring at present continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is another attempt by the government to divert the attention of this parliament, and perhaps the media, away from the other critical issues that are facing our country today. We do not need to be reminded that we have the worst unemployment problem this country has ever known. We have young people who are facing the prospect of no future whatsoever. We have a business community that has stagnated. Our international trade figures continue to reflect doom and gloom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not the times when the government should be looking at these matters; it should not be bringing these red herrings into the parliament. What is more important in this day and age is that the government should be directing its energies towards resolving the real issues this country is facing at the moment. That has not occurred because the government does not have the answers. It proved over the last decade that it does not have the answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of whether Australia should become a republic and result in the removal of our monarch as the head of state is still to be resolved. Our Prime Minister has failed to demonstrate why our existing form of government is in any way flawed when the latest figures clearly demonstrate that he is losing the argument. Piecemeal measures such as this bill which pre-empt such debate will serve only to divide the Australian community further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I speak on this matter of citizenship, I do so with a certain amount of personal experience. I was the elected head of a local government area in Tasmania. I conducted hundreds, if not thousands, of personal and collective citizenship ceremonies in my then municipality of Clarence, which is now the city of Clarence. During all that time, I never once met a prospective citizen who was concerned about the oath or affirmation that they were going to take. All they were worried about was being a good citizen of Australia, and they were very proud to partake in that ceremony. I can recall only too well the numerous occasions on which I saw pride in the eyes of individuals when they repeated the words which obviously meant so much to them, coming to a country where they could be free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been out of that job for some seven years now, but it is amazing the number of people who walk up to me in the street, or when I am at social functions, and say, `Do you remember me? You naturalised me. I remember that ceremony; it was a wonderful occasion'. At the ceremonies in our city, people were presented with a native eucalyptus tree. I usually asked them how the tree was going and, in most cases, they said that it was growing well. They look after it; it symbolises the event and reminds them of the happiness and pride they felt at the ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Panizza said earlier, the receipt of Australian citizenship is probably the most important event for any migrant who has chosen to call Australia their home. As such, the oath or affirmation of allegiance should be a  meaningful occasion for the new citizen which reflects their loyalty to Australia. There is not one person who applies for citizenship without the knowledge that the Queen of Australia is our head of state. Therefore, I believe that we will create confusion in prospective migrants if we ask them to make a pledge of commitment that in no way refers to that head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this bill is piecemeal and because it does not reflect the result of a referendum, our Queen will be referred to in a number of oaths but she will not be referred to in the citizenship ceremony. Senators know that, when enlisting for the defence forces, there is a requirement for an oath or affirmation to Her Majesty the Queen to be taken. Similarly, there is a requirement under section 42 of the constitution that members of the House of Representatives and members of this place make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the Queen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will guarantee nothing more than a situation where we have different statements of allegiance by different categories of Australians. This is hardly the evidence of a well thought out and considered initiative. Rather than strengthening our existing citizenship oath, this new legislation will merely weaken it. The pledge which is contained in the government's proposal reflects much less commitment than the oath or affirmation which was previously used. A pledge makes no reference to our head of state, our constitution, or any of our other basic institutions. It completely ignores the heritage on which our nation was originally founded. The vague allusions contained in the pledge to Australia and to its people, or to other concepts such as democratic beliefs, create no sense of sureness in the prospective citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill fails to address the real issue of concern in the Citizenship Act: it does not reflect in the true manner what it really means to be an Australian, or the privileges and obligations which accompany that citizenship. There is no reference to a unified Australia. There is no reference to our values, our principles and our basic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the Australian Citizenship Act has not been altered substantially since 1948, the coalition has called several times for a full review and overhaul of the citizenship act. During consideration of this bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a former Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stephen, described the act as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only is it an extraordinary example of legal and bureaucratic language, but it is extraordinarily inappropriate for its title.</PARA>
<PARA>As part of our commitment in the lead-up to the last election, John Hewson announced that a coalition government would establish a national council on citizenship which would be chaired by a prominent Australian and which would overview the whole question of the rights and obligations which accompany the honour. The coalition believes that this parliament should support legislation which strengthens the citizenship act and that this should be a matter of priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since assuming the role of Prime Minister, Mr Keating has repeatedly attempted to deride and undermine our national symbols. He has even had the gall to attempt to rewrite our history. His recent outburst over the Olympic Games further demonstrates his willingness to ignore reality. When I witnessed members of the Australian community celebrating the selection of Sydney to host the 2000 games, it was quite obvious from the way they proudly paraded the Australian flag that they had no intentions or thoughts of changing this particular act, the flag or anything else&mdash;they were just proud to be Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strengthening of public opinion behind the status quo demonstrates to me that Australians are valuing more and more their stability and our constitution. They will eventually reject, in no uncertain terms, this attempt to push our country into a position of instability. It could be that our Prime Minister inherits his derision of our past from his Irish ancestors, but the overwhelming majority of Australians from varying backgrounds are proud of our nation's background and the manner in which we have developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that this bill allocates a further $230,000 to be spent in the 1993-94 financial year to promote this so-called new pledge to the Australian community. Let there be no doubt that this quarter of a million dollars of taxpayers' money will not be used to push the pledge but will be just another excuse to push the republican cause at the expense of all else. It is nothing more than a slush fund for our Prime Minister to push his ideals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on the subject of funding by this government, I have had a lot of representations regarding the government's allocation of hundreds of thousands of dollars to the republican committee with the sole aim of pursuing the government's agenda, yet not one cent of taxpayers' money has been allocated to support our Australian constitution and our Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is divisive. It does nothing to address the real issues facing Australia. It creates two classes of Australian citizens: those who were born in Australia and therefore have an allegiance to the Queen; and those from overseas who will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main reason why this parliament should reject this pledge is that it totally pre-empts the outcome of any debate by the community and a change to the pledge without the input of the Australian people will show once again that this parliament is more concerned with Mr Keating's agenda than with the wishes of the majority of Australians. </PARA>

At the end of the day, it is always well to remember that it is us who bring credit to our flag and not the other way around. The flag is there for us to rally to, not for it to bring glory upon us. If there has been a failure to take the Australian reputation and its symbols to the rest of the world and have the rest of the world recognise what they mean, the failure is the failure of the person in whom we have placed executive power&mdash;the Prime Minister. It is his responsibility to say that he is proud of his country and his people, but he cannot even do that. He cannot even fly his own flag on his automobile. What sort of a leader is that? He puts himself first and Australia second. This is just part of the continuing subterfuge of finding more money to promote the great crusade to become King Paul I of Australia. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Is the minister aware of a recent survey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics which found that more than one in four households rely on social security payments for their main source of income? Can the minister explain to these families, many of which are victims of the government's recession, how the Prime Minister's obsession with Australia becoming a republic and having a new flag will assist those families in achieving greater self-sufficiency and prosperity?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1381" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I think it is important that the Senate understands what one in four families being in receipt of social security payments really means. Senator Newman failed to say that families in receipt of the family assistance as well as those in receipt of the family allowance supplement receive funds from the same source.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman's question conveys the understanding that all of those families are social security pension beneficiaries. That is a misunderstanding of the payments to those families. Approximately 90 per cent of Australian families enjoy a family allowance payment that is also paid in the same way. I urge Senator Newman to be cautious in respect of what those statistics mean.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst other things, the assistance given to help rear children is a fair recognition by government of the importance of children. That is why we have the family payment and the family allowance supplement. When the family allowance supplement was introduced, the government did something that the opposition never did: it set benchmarks for the assistance of children. Those figures have been set; they are indexed; and they are there forever. I suspect that the opposition, if it ever were in government, would not remove them. So it is important to understand the meaning of that simple statistic which Senator Newman dropped into this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the second part of Senator Newman's question, it is quite clear from dealing with any people at all in the community that people who have a sense of confidence, a sense of their own place in the world and a sense that they are making decisions about their own lives are the ones who manage better. That is what this government recognises. It recognises the right of people to be assisted and the right of people to be able to stand on their own two feet, define their lives and make choices. That is the exact analogy of what the Prime Minister is saying to this country. When this country is standing on its own two feet, defining itself, confidently facing the rest of the world and winning Olympic bids, it is meeting the challenge that is faced by women in this country. Senator Newman should know that. As women are defining themselves and becoming more confident, so is the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see an entire parallel; so do thousands of Australians. I am shocked that Senator Newman does not. She is misrepresenting this statistic and she simply does not understand that confident people make the best choices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you could conclude many things from Senator Newman's peculiar association of these ideas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I directed my department to review its policy for the disposal of the surplus weapons following representations from the Australian Police Ministers Council through the Minister for Justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Did the government's humiliating backdown on the budget proposal for FBT on business travel, announced by the Assistant Treasurer in 1993, occur as a result of an analysis by Access Economics? Does the government and the minister agree with Access Economics that the proposal runs directly counter to the claimed job creation focus of the budget, undermines the government's deficit reduction strategy and, rather than reducing the federal deficit by $60 million, could increase the deficit by as much as, or even considerably more than, that amount?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the government's view that the measure concerned is likely to run counter to either job creation objectives or the deficit reduction strategy. It is always the case that every time there is a proposal to increase the tax on those best off, the opposition leaps to their defence with alacrity. I can say with 100 per cent accuracy that that has been the record of those opposite every time there has been a proposal to increase the rate of tax on those who are well off. Whether it be capital gains tax, the original introduction of the fringe benefits tax or whatever, they have at least been loyal on every occasion in their defence of the wealthy and well off.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is a very interesting answer in view of the industry assessment that 20,000 to 30,000 jobs would be lost, not gained, as a result of the proposal. How does that fit in with the job creation process? In addition, even John Brown, a former Labor minister, said that this proposal was not about revenue. Even the departmental officials concede that.

The situation is simply this: I have been involved in public debate of public issues for 20 years and I have never heard an industry come forward and say, `This increase in tax is a great idea and we will create more jobs if only you would do it'. So coming forward with industry analyses which say that the industry does not think putting a tax on it is a good idea is not actually very unique. They all say that, and history usually proves that Chicken Little lives in most industries. They always say that the sky is going to fall in, and it very rarely does.</PARA></TALK.START>

Although this house was originally envisaged by the founding fathers as a states rights house, that disappeared very quickly when political partisanship came into this chamber, as inevitably it must.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As most senators would be aware, one of the important aspects of the retail sales activity in the Christmas period is that it also leads to a surge in employment in that period; a very important surge in employment for many ordinary Australian families and their children who, as students, are seeking part time jobs, and for the unemployed for whom, although the jobs may be temporary, they are nevertheless extremely welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS publication says that last December, Australia's retail sector created an additional 35,000 to 40,000 seasonal jobs&mdash;jobs additional to the underlying pattern of an increase in employment. December 1993 has the potential to see an even bigger seasonal boost than in previous years. The government's fiscal policy is designed to provide an additional stimulus just so that there will be more available for people to spend in the retail stores this year, while laying down a firm schedule for reducing the budget deficit in the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key ingredient of that additional stimulus is the personal income tax cuts scheduled for 15 November. That will contribute at least $300 million in extra retail outlays to pump into the retail stores this year. It will be a great tragedy if the intransigence, the lack of cooperation&mdash;the sorts of problems that Senator Ray so articulately outlined in the Senate&mdash;and the fiscal irresponsibility of the Senate were to lead to the situation where those personal income tax cuts could not go ahead on time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the medium-term reduction strategy is still being held hostage by the Senate, the government will not be in a fiscally responsible position to go ahead with the bringing forward of those tax cuts, and those extra jobs over Christmas will be in jeopardy; they will be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are significant concerns about the loss of the tax cuts to those ordinary Australian working men and women, because they deserve them. The bring forward to which this budget contributes is important to those families; it is important to those individuals. Over and above that, it is a very fundamental economic stimulus to create more of those seasonal jobs over Christmas that are so important but which may not be of concern to the complacent opposition, which is concerned just to play spoiling tactics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cuts are very important to ordinary Australian men and women and their children and I hope we can get a responsible passage through the Senate of the budget measures so that the tax cuts can come into effect on 15 November, economic stimulus can be generated and those jobs can be created.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure Senator McKiernan and anybody else unfortunate enough to have been listening last night that it is not true. I think it has become the stuff of urban medical legend recently that obstetricians all over the country are leaving their specialty to practise in gynaecology and fertility, but that claim simply is not true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I met with the President of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists as part of my regular consultations. I would suggest that the president, Dr Hinde, might have a bit better idea of what is happening in his specialty than Senator Herron. Dr Hinde informed me that it was not true. He said that, while the increased cost of medical defence was putting a great deal of fear into the specialty, they had not been leaving it yet, but they might in the future if something was not done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of Senator Herron's exact remarks, it is certainly true that in the USA there has been a greatly increased tendency for people to take out cases against obstetricians, although there is no evidence of increased cases here. I think there are two reasons why the medical insurance funds have put up the premiums for obstetricians so much. One is that they were shockingly underfunded in recent years and they have had to try to make up for that underfunding in a short period of time. The second is that while the number of cases has not been great, it is true to say that sometimes the payouts, the damages awarded, are very large indeed. While the college of obstetricians is prepared to concede that there is a danger that people might leave the field in the future unless we do something about it, it is certainly not of the view that such an exodus has already occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to look very carefully at a study which hopefully will be published by about March of next year on this question and to try to deal with it in the first half of next year. Obviously we do not want obstetricians to leave in the future. It is a specialty that is of vital interest to all of us. I think the Medicare data shows how silly is Senator Herron's claim that half the obstetricians left in the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the four years from 1988 to 1992, Medicare data shows that there was a decline of only 3.7 per cent nationally in the number of specialists who perform more than five confinements or caesareans annually. The number of obstetricians practising in Australia in 1984-85 was 722 full time and 151 part time; a total of 873. By 1992-93 that was 748 full time, 167 part time and 18 others; a total of 933.

Senator Troeth asks: how can any tax stimulate employment? What we are doing to stimulate employment goes to the general macro-economic approach in which we are arguing, in this particular year, that we should have a budget deficit of $16 billion&mdash;and that will certainly have a stimulatory effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true to say that if we took taxes off all businesses, there would be some growth in employment. But there would also be a massive shortfall in revenue to any government. It is always easier to say, `If you do not have a tax covering this or that particular industry, you will have wider employment'. The main factor in the government's thinking is to make sure that the tax falls fairly right across-the-board and that the tax mix is right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen reports in several newspapers today that the Japanese government is considering opening its market for the importation of rice. Northern Asia has suffered a poor winter and with adverse weather conditions, both in Korea and Japan, the rice harvest in both those countries is coming in at well under the anticipated level of consumption. It may well be that, this year, the Japanese government will be looking to import two million tonnes of rice. Australia would be a prime source of supply to fill that market gap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good news is that Australian rice growers have in store sufficient stocks to meet whatever demand is called upon to be supplied into that Japanese market. The Australian government has, of course, consistently registered with the government of Japan the need for it to open its rice markets and to regard the Australian product as a product that it can draw upon to meet the needs of its own consumers. We are competitive as a rice supplier in the world, both in terms of price and in terms of the quality of our product. Indeed, it can be said that Australian grown rice suits the needs of Japan almost more than other rice from any source. It is not, however, appropriate for a government to be grateful that weather conditions have created a marketing opportunity. While one should take advantage of that marketing opportunity, there are some structural issues about the Japanese market that need to be addressed here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This time last week I was in Tokyo. I met the Prime Minister, Mr Hosokawa; the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mr Hata; and the Minister for International Trade and Industry, Mr Kumagai. In my role as trade minister, I put to all three of them that it was important that Japan cease its policy of self-sufficiency and adopt a policy of food security, that is, not to try to produce all their food needs domestically but, rather, to have a mix of imports and domestic production as well and open their market accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the issue that begs for a comment here is the issue of the Uruguay Round. Both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Industry and Trade in Japan are firmly committed to the completion of the Uruguay Round by 15 December. They reassured me solidly on that point. But for the round to properly be completed with a balanced outcome across all sectors and in a fair way, it is important that the issue of agriculture be addressed. Specifically, in Japan and Korea that means addressing the closed rice market. The views that Australia has consistently argued&mdash;that the market should be opened&mdash;were again put by me as a means of successfully concluding the Uruguay Round. That means a commitment by Japan for comprehensive tariffication of its market barriers for rice across the board without exception. In view of this shortfall in domestic production, I hope that can be something that the government seizes on as a positive signal to help complete the Uruguay Round this year and reduce the price for Japan's own domestic producers in the interests of freer trade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I had the honour of presenting awards, on behalf of the Australian government, at a function hosted by the Business and Professional Women's Club of Canberra as part of the ACT small business week. During my speech, I referred to the published research, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Employment patterns and practices in small firms in Australia: an assessment of skill deficiencies and training needs</EMPHASIS>, undertaken by Professor Alan Williams of the University of Newcastle. In his research he found that, of the more than 11,000 businesses surveyed, 38 per cent were owned and operated by men, 33 per cent were owned and operated by women and 28 per cent were jointly owned and operated by men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also indicated that there was a marked shift towards women owning and running their own firms. If this trend continues, it is anticipated that certainly by the middle to the latter part of this decade a majority of small or micro businesses in Australia will be run and owned by women. We still do not have enough research on why this is occurring, but it is quite clear from anecdotal information around the place that women are more successful at running their own businesses than men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that women are better at customer service and industrial relations. From what I have been told in discussions with the financial institutions, women are more cautious in their financial arrangements. They are better managers of the finances of a small business. They more thoroughly prepare their business plan for their small businesses than do men. One banker told me that if he had to choose between lending money for a small business to a man or a woman, he would lend to the woman because, on balance, according to the figures available, women are more likely to be more successful in running a small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is one of the significant changes in our society that has not been recognised. As small business is already providing the biggest part of economic growth and employment growth in Australia, we have to give due recognition to the fact that it is women who are doing it to ensure that we get the job growth for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only area where we would like to see some increase in women's activity is the area of export oriented industries. A survey by the export access program shows that only about two per cent of those businesses that are successfully into export are actually owned and run by women. That is one area in which we would like to see an improvement in women's participation. Overall, this trend is very good for women but, above all else, it means a good outcome for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. I will not even use all of my five minutes. I am basically putting the record straight about Senator Ian MacDonald's performance when he attacks people about small business and about the opposition's policy on small business. Senator Ian MacDonald attacks our policies about fringe benefits tax and the impact it may have on small business when his party, at the last election, proposed a 15 per cent GST on the performance of every small business in Australia. His party was going to impose a tax that, in administrative terms, was much more wasteful in time and effort and resources for any small business than the FBT that we are talking about today. At the last election a large number of small businesses voted for the Labor Party for the first time, because they did not want to spend every Sunday night doing the bookwork on the GST&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

Those opposite have the temerity to argue here that a limited FBT, an adjustment to the FBT, will have a drastic effect on small business when they were going to tax 900,000 small businesses and have every small business proprietor spending every Sunday night doing the bookwork for the GST. When Senator Ian MacDonald, as the shadow minister for local government, was asked about the impact of the GST, he could not explain on three different times in the one day whether or not there would be a GST on water, on rubbish collection and on local government. He got his coalition in a terrible mix-up trying to explain all of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was an attack on small business, yet members of the opposition get up here and say that they are the champions of small business. I would have to say that, of all opposition senators, only one is genuine about small business and that is Senator Boswell who consistently raises practical issues about small business with me and with the government. He speaks to those issues in this place as a petitioner of small business. I suspect that Senator Boswell has not been on the front bench for a long time because he could not support a GST on small business which members opposite were very up-front about supporting. </PARA>

The debate in this chamber concerns the imposition of tax by this government on small business. This is the government which said that it would not impose any new tax and then has proceeded to do so. Budget paper No. 1 states that sales tax, customs and excise, would be up 9.1 per cent. Other taxes, fees and fines, would be up 10.4 per cent.

Today there was a draft ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation defining local council car parks as commercial car parks for the purposes of the fringe benefits tax for parking arrangements. In other words, by not having the ruling system subject to the parliament and tabling and disallowance, by discretion, the government is able, through its agency, to get further taxes imposed and collected by the Commissioner of Taxation. There is no way in the world that a local government car park which is provided for the benefit of shoppers and other community benefits is a commercial enterprise in terms of the legislation that was debated in this chamber. </PARA>

One of the reasons&mdash;and it goes to the core of what Senator Macdonald was saying&mdash;why we get these taxes is that very few people in the Labor government, and particularly people in Treasury, have much idea of what makes small business tick. Senator Ferguson and I were discussing a question to the Minister for Science and Small Business, and that is, `How do you really get a small business in Australia?'.

Those of us who work in Canberra for hundreds of days a year do not get to do that very often.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take up the final point that Senator Campbell made in his contribution to the debate because I think it was a valid one. It was in terms of the amount of time that we are obliged to spend in Canberra, particularly in this chamber, dealing with various matters. That does prevent the vast majority of us from doing other things we would prefer to do in terms of staying in contact with our constituencies, including the small business constituency, which is very important in Australia as a generator of investment, jobs and economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the reason we have to spend so much time in the national capital, in the Senate chamber, is the gridlock that has enveloped the Senate since the chamber resumed after the election of 1993. Circumstances have changed. We heard today that five straight election losses have caused the coalition to embark upon a totally negative campaign of destruction and vandalism. That is the main reason we are obliged to spend so much time here in Canberra in this insulated and isolated political environment. There is no doubt about that. If one looks at the amount of time spent on frivolous and fatuous points of order during question time, on nonsensical notices of motion and so on and so forth, one can see that gridlock in the American style grips the Australian Senate already. That is one of the main reasons we are not able to stay in touch with those parts of the Australian constituency which are of greatest significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has to be seen in the context of tax policy overall&mdash;in the context of taxes having come down since 1983 from the high period of Fraser, Howard and Stone when taxes routinely were over 60 per cent. They have dropped dramatically. We can now say, with absolute clarity and certainty, that the OECD has made the observation that Australia is the lowest taxed country in the western industrial world. That is not an assessment of the Australian government, although the government is happy to endorse and underline it. That is an assessment of the OECD&mdash;the lowest taxed country in the western industrial world. </PARA>

I would be particularly interested in Senator Herron's view on that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After two recent cases in Western Australia, the (then) President of the Australian Medical Association . . . , Mr Michael O'Halloran, quoted in the media figures which demonstrate that less than half the 80 or so specialist obstetricians and gynaecologists in Western Australia practise obstetrics, and further, that there are only three privately practising obstetricians in Western Australia who are less than 40 years of age.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No. 1) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr. President, this bill is part of a package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, which was introduced into the Senate on 7 September 1993. That bill contained the Government's key Budget taxation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its campaign to obstruct the passage of the Government's 1993-4 Budget, the Opposition referred the Deficit Reduction Bill to a Senate Committee. The Committee was asked to determine whether, by combining measures dealing with several subjects of taxation, the bill contravened section 55 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament has been passing taxation bills combining several subjects of taxation since at least 1984. Only now has this been raised as an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's senior legal advisers, and Parliamentary Counsel, gave advice to the Committee that the Deficit Reduction Bill was clearly valid and that none of its measures imposed taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Committee concluded, correctly, that only the High Court can determine issues of constitutional validity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also concluded that there was a risk that the bill would be declared invalid. This conclusion was contrary to the advice of the Government's Chief General Counsel and of other experts who presented their views to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not accept the Committee's conclusion. Moreover, the Committee gave no reasons for its conclusions and gave the Government no guidance as to how to split the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Views put to the Committee that the bill is invalid fall into two categories.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first, that any increase in the formal rate of a tax is an imposition of tax. This view draws an illogical distinction between a rate increase and an enlargement of a tax base.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">second, that any increase in liability to taxation is an imposition of tax. If this argument is accepted, then most of the tax laws passed over the past 50 years are also invalid. This is an absurd argument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is entitled to rely on the clear and unequivocal advice of its legal advisers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Opposition's actions on the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill have created considerable uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to remove that uncertainty and withdraw the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and to re-introduce the Budget measures in a package of related bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the measures included in the `test case' bill, the re-packaged bills would not be challenged by those who argue that the only amendments in the package which impose tax are those which increase a rate of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has deliberately rejected the extreme view that any increase in the incidence of a tax is an imposition of tax. It has, therefore, refrained from structuring these bills to avoid a challenge from this quarter. If that view is correct, then virtually all of the Commonwealth's tax laws are invalid. It would be pointless to address those concerns without rewriting the corpus of all the existing tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills comprised in this package are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bills (Nos. 1 to 3) 1993; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5 sales tax bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the bills has been marked with a `T' to signify that they are not bills which impose taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also believes that the constitutional issues must be resolved once and for all, so that the Parliament can focus on the substance, and not the form, of Government initiatives. To allow the issue to be settled quickly, and without affecting the integrity of the Budget package, one of the bills (the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993) has been drafted as a test bill to facilitate a High Court challenge. This has been done by combining 2 minor rate increases involving different subjects of taxation. These measures do not affect revenue until after 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993, which contains the following measures:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increases in the Medicare levy low income thresholds.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of the concessional treatment that applies to the taxation of unused annual and long service leave.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes in the taxation treatment of excess domestic travel allowances and expenses and certain non-deductible expenses.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Denial of income tax deductions for car parking expenses for self-employed persons.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes in the taxation treatment of credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare levy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the low income thresholds below which people will not be required to pay any levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For 1993-94, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $12,688 and couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $21,366 will not be required to pay the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no change to the provisions which increase the threshold for couples and sole parents by $2100 for each dependent child or student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the increased low income thresholds is $30 million in 1993-94, $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unused annual leave and unused long service leave payments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will remove the concessional tax treatment that applies to lump sum payments of unused annual leave and unused long service leave made on termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments in respect of unused long service leave accrued on or after 18 August 1993 and payments in respect of unused annual leave made on or after 18 August 1978 will be taxed as normal income. However, there is no change to the tax treatment of these payments if the taxpayer's termination of employment is as a consequence of bona fide redundancy or invalidity or is under an approved early retirement scheme. Neither is the concessional tax treatment of long service leave accrued before 18 August 1993 affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments ensure that the tax system does not discourage taxpayers from using their leave entitlements for their intended purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to the revenue is $80 million in 1993-94, $180 million in 1994-95, $165 million in 1995-96 and $180 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation of credit unions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will remove the exemption from income tax for income in the nature of interest received by credit unions on loans made to their senators and will allow credit unions to be taxed as cooperatives where they satisfy the requirements for that treatment. To give credit unions time to adjust to the new measures, there will be a phasing-in period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure will remove the competitive advantage credit unions enjoy as a result of the special tax treatment given to them, and is consistent with the Government's general approach of ensuring tax neutrality between business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $25 million in 1995-96 and $30 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-deductible expenses</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income tax law will also be amended to allow deductions to employers for expenses incurred in providing their employees with a range of benefits such as entertainment, club fees, leisure facilities, travel expenses of accompanying relatives, Higher Education Contribution Scheme payments and Student Financial Supplement Scheme payments. These expenses have previously not been deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefits of this nature, if provided to employees, are fringe benefits under the fringe benefits tax law. However, the taxable value of these benefits is reduced to the extent to which they are non-deductible to employers under the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment, which will apply from 1 April 1994,  will allow a deduction to employers for these expenses under the income tax law. In consequence, it will subject these benefits to a fringe benefits tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $435 million in 1994-95, $240 million in 1995-96 and $240 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excess domestic travel</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the fringe benefits tax law to create a new class of fringe benefit based on the amount of a travelling allowance received by an employee for travel in Australia which is in excess of a prescribed amount. The amount will be prescribed by regulation and will be set following consultations with interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income tax law will also be amended to disallow expenditure incurred by employees or self-employed persons on travel expenses (ie. accommodation, food, drink, and expenditure incidental to travel undertaken in Australia) which are in excess of the prescribed amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will apply from 1 April 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Car parking expenses for self-employed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the income tax law so that, from 1 July 1994, a tax deduction for the cost of car parking for persons other than employees will be denied in certain circumstances. This will place car parking by self-employed persons on a comparable tax basis to car parking for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A deduction for car parking expenses incurred by self-employed persons will only be denied where certain conditions apply. The rules for determining the non-deductible amount of a car parking expense in this bill are similar to the rules applic</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">able to employers in valuing a car parking fringe benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue of this measure is $70 million in 1995-96 and $35 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will come into operation on the day on which it receives Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No. 2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the second in the package of bills which replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains two of the taxation measures announced by the Treasurer in the 1993-4 Budget and which were previously contained in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the increase in the rate of fringe benefits tax; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the change in the taxation treatment of friendly societies, including an increase in the rate of tax on their life insurance business to bring it into line with the rate of tax on similar business undertaken by life companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been deliberately designed to facilitate a challenge in the High Court on the constitutional issues raised before the Senate Committee that considered the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. It does this by combining two rate increases, for different subjects of taxation, in the same bill. The Government's legal advisers believe that this bill is constitutional but the Government considers that any uncertainty in this area must be resolved quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in this bill will have no practical effect before the middle of next year, and will have only minimal revenue impacts. Therefore, there is time for the constitutional issues to be tested without affecting taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed explanation of the two measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FBT rate of tax</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the current rate of fringe benefits tax from 48.25 per cent to 48.4 per cent. The increase will take effect from</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1 April 1994 and will maintain the alignment of the FBT rate with the top marginal personal tax rate and Medicare levy rate. The increase reflects the increase in the Medicare levy rate, from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent, on 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $9 million in 1994-95 and $8 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will change the taxation treatment of friendly societies and other registered organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will phase-out, over three years from the 1994-95 income year, the concessional tax rate for friendly societies in respect of their life insurance and certain other insurance business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of that change, the bill will, from 1 July 1994, extend to friendly societies the same entitlement to deductions as is allowed to life insurance companies for the costs of getting in their life insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another change will increase, from 1 July 1995, the rebate available to holders of friendly society life policies who are assessed on bonuses. This increase is a consequence of the phasing-out of the concessional tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue from these measures is $25 million in 1995-96 and $69 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will come into operation when it receives the Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL (No. 3) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is the third in the package of bills which replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It incorporates changes to the timing of the first stage of the tax cuts announced and legislated for in 1992, the deferral of the second round of those tax cuts, and the introduction of a low income rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to a more detailed explanation of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Personal tax cuts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in the bill will change the timing for the commencement of the two stage reduction in the tax rates announced in One Nation on 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first stage will now commence on 15 November 1993, seven and a half months earlier than scheduled. The bill provides that the second stage of tax cuts will commence at the beginning of a financial year to be fixed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 15 November 1993, the bill contains the new composite rate scales to apply for 1993-94 and the first stage rates for the 1994-95 and later income years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rates to apply from 15 November 1993 will benefit taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $20,700.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax cuts will cost the revenue $1.55 billion this financial year. The ongoing cost to revenue of the first stage of the personal tax cuts is $2.9 billion in 1994-95 and $3.12 billion in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Low income rebate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide a rebate of up to $150 to taxpayers whose taxable income for 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $24,450. The new rebate will mainly assist those taxpayers who do not benefit from the One Nation tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers with a taxable income of up to $20,700 will be entitled to a rebate of $150 in their assessments for the 1993-94 and later income years. The rebate will reduce at the rate of 4 cents in each dollar of taxable income in excess of $20,700 and completely phase-out when taxable income reaches $24,450.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated revenue costs for this measure are $530 million in 1994-95, $515 million in 1995-96 and $500 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will not come into operation until the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993, and the 5 sales tax bills in this package, receive the Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SALES TAX (CUSTOMS) (DEFICIT REDUCTION) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this bill is the fourth in the package of bills designed to replace the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This bill, together with four other bills in this package, will give effect to changes to the sales tax law announced in the 1993-4 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not accept that any of the bills in this package imposes tax. Nevertheless, it has structured the sales tax bills so as to put the matter beyond challenge by those who would argue that an increase in a formal rate of tax is an imposition of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For constitutional reasons, sales tax is imposed by four Acts. Those Acts impose sales tax to the extent that it is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a duty of customs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a duty of excise;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a tax on in situ swimming pools;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a tax that is none of the above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill modifies the Sales Tax (Exemption and Classifications) Act 1992 to the extent that that Act deals with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Imposition (Customs) Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now turn to the three sales tax changes covered by this bill, and the other sales tax bills in this package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first change will increase all sales tax rates by one percentage point, with effect from 18 August 1993. This is expected to raise $435 million this year and $585 million in 1994-95. A further one percentage point increase for all sales tax rates will come into effect on 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second change will increase the rates of sales tax on wine, also with effect from 18 August. Compared with beer and spirits, wine is lightly taxed. While it is presently subject to sales tax, it does not carry any excise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on wine with an  alcoholic content of greater than 1.15 per cent from 20 per cent to 31 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of tax on low-alcohol wine, that is wine with an alcoholic content of 1.15 per cent or less, is to increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. Some low-alcohol wine is currently taxable at 20 per cent and its rate of tax will increase to 21 per cent in line with the proposed increase for all sales tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $70 million in 1993-94, $95 million in 1994-95, $105 million in 1995-96 and $110 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last sales tax change will vary the rate of tax applicable to luxury motor vehicles, also with effect from 18 August 1993. Luxury vehicles are currently taxable at 30 per cent on their entire wholesale value. The current sales tax treatment results in a substantial pricing distortion:  the addition of one dollar to the wholesale price of a passenger motor vehicle now priced at the threshold would increase the sales tax liability by $4873.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to remove this distortion by applying a split rate of sales tax to luxury motor vehicles. Broadly, the ordinary rates of sales tax applicable to motor vehicles will apply up to the wholesale luxury threshold. A rate of 45 per cent will apply to that portion of the wholesale value over the luxury threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $5 million in 1993-94 and $10 million in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's recent announcement that the proposed initial public offering of shares in Qantas would be deferred until 1994-95 means therefore that, in the absence of any legislation to remedy this situation, the provisions intended to commence on the dates on which 50% and 100% of the airline are sold will, in fact, lapse on 31 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of most concern to the Government in this regard, naturally, are the employee-related provisions of the Qantas Sale Act&mdash;which are planned to come into effect on the day on which 50% of the airline is sold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions either "save",  post-sale, certain existing employee entitlements and rights arising from pre-sale service, or else they remove airline employees from the ambit of legislation applying only to employees of entities that are owned or controlled by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The premature removal of airline employees from the ambit of such Commonwealth legislation while the Qantas group remains 75% owned by the Commonwealth, and the failure to put amending legislation in place to retain those employees' already accrued benefits, gained pre-sale, would clearly be inequitable and could not be supported by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative that these provisions not be allowed to lapse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To prevent any such inadvertent removal of the rightful entitlements of the airline employees concerned, I propose that the date of automatic repeal in the Qantas Sale Act be altered to accord with the rescheduled timing for the sale of the remainder of the Commonwealth's shares in Qantas in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the bill before the House amends the date of the automatic repeal of the unproclaimed sections of the Qantas Sale Act from 31 December 1993 to 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is also being taken in this bill to make a minor amendment to the Qantas Sale Act to remove any doubt about the intended operation of section 37 of that Act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is a portfolio bill which will make minor amendments to the Commonwealth's anti-discrimination legislation, the Privacy Act 1988 and the High Court of Australia Act 1979. I will only outline the significant parts of this bill, as a number of the amendments it contains are merely technical or made as a result of other legislative amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, amendments were made to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984  and the Disability Discrimination Act 1992  to simplify and streamline the procedure for enforcing determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in the Federal Court. Briefly, that procedure provides that the determination, on being registered in the Federal Court, becomes enforceable as an order of the court after 28 days, unless the respondent to the determination applies for review of the determination within this period. I am concerned that this strict 28 day time limit may cause injustice in some circumstances, so I have introduced amendments to allow the Federal Court to review a determination outside this 28 day time limit in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will make a number of amendments to the Privacy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures for making a representative complaint and for enforcing determinations under the Privacy Act will be replaced by new provisions modelled on last year's amendments to the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and Sex Discrimination Act. In addition, the amendments I have just outlined to allow a respondent to seek the leave of the court to have a determination reviewed outside the usual 28 day period, will be included in the Privacy Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also clarify that compensation awarded by the Privacy Commissioner to a complainant as part of a determination can include compensation for loss or damage suffered by way of injury to feelings or humiliation. This will bring the Privacy Act provisions into line with the position under the Crimes Act 1914 (in relation to spent convictions) and the Disability Discrimination Act, the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will ensure greater consistency in the legislation administered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the rules under the Privacy Act governing disclosures of credit information by credit providers to state and territory government authorities administering schemes which assist low-income earners to obtain mortgage credit. It was brought to the Government's notice that the Privacy Act, as it is currently structured, does not sufficiently cater to the information needs of a number of states that operate, and effectively underwrite, mortgage assistance schemes. The amendment will resolve the information needs of the governments without unreasonably infringing the privacy of individual borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am introducing an amendment which will delay the commencement date of the superannuation amendments which were inserted in the Sex Discrimination Act in 1991. These provisions were to commence in June this year in order to give superannuation funds time to develop options to allow existing members to transfer to non-discriminatory schemes. The guidelines to be formulated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to assist funds to develop non-discriminatory options were not finalised in sufficient time. Accordingly, I have introduced an amendment to delay commencement of the provisions until 1 July 1994 to allow time for the funds to be in a position to comply with the new regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the High Court of Australia Act 1979 will change the administrative structure of the High Court by amalgamating the existing offices and responsibilities of the Clerk of the Court and the Registrar into one office which is to be called the Chief Executive and Principal Registrar. This will streamline the administration of the court by avoiding duplication of the functions currently performed by the Clerk and the Registrar. The Chief Justice has specifically requested and approved these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (MARITIME INDUSTRY) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians and the Australian economy pay dearly for work-related fatalities, injuries and industrial diseases. The Industry Commission, in its recently released draft report into workers compensation in Australia, has noted that every year there are at least 500 deaths, 200,000 injuries and an unknown number of people who fall ill principally because of hazards they have been exposed to at work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The monetary costs are estimated to be of the order of $10 billion annually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees, their families, employers, insurers and society in general all bear this burden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-monetary costs, such as the pain and suffering of an injured employee or the loss of a loved one killed in a work-related accident, cannot be calculated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Australian shipping industry alone, over the past 5 years there has been an average of 1,000 injuries a year reported to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. Many of these injuries could have been avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make the maritime industry a healthier and safer industry to work in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has two key elements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, it establishes a consultative framework for the ship operator and maritime industry workers to cooperate in developing a safer working environment and better work practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it sets out the duties of care to be observed by all who work on board ships and offshore industry mobile units. This element, in effect, codifies the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, over the past decade or so, all Australian states, territories and the Commonwealth have developed new style OHS legislation based on International Labour Organisation Convention No 155&mdash;the Occupational Safety and Health Convention 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This national approach was reinforced in 1985, when this government established the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission to provide national coordination, facilitate national action and raise public awareness of OHS issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements set out in the bill are based on the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and are similar to the arrangements provided under the occupational health and safety laws of the Australian states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year, parliament passed legislation introducing a new workers compensation scheme for seafarers. One of the vital elements of that scheme is its mandatory rehabilitation arrangements, aimed at getting injured workers restored to health and back to work as quickly as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new OHS arrangements will complement the new seafarers compensation legislation by addressing the causes of accidents and thus reducing workplace injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To reinforce this complementary element, the administration of the new maritime OHS arrangements will be combined with the administration of the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authority will have its functions expanded to reflect its new responsibilities and its name will be changed to the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I will now describe the major features of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General duties of care</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions contained in Part 2 of the bill set out in general terms the mutual responsibilities of ship operators, employees and contractors, as well as the responsibilities of manufacturers and suppliers of plant and substances used on ships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence, all parties must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the workplace and the work performed there do not endanger the safety or health of the workers, or of any other person in the vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Included in the employer's responsibilities is the important requirement to give employees the necessary information, instruction, training and supervision to perform their work safely and in a way that does not risk their health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as part of those responsibilities, industry employers and the maritime unions have been jointly developing industry-wide training packages suitable for use on board ships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I congratulate the industry on this initiative, which will allow seafarers to keep up to date with their OHS training during their off-duty periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workplace arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides a framework for employers and employees to cooperate and consult in addressing health and safety matters in the workplace. It does this through the establishment of designated work groups and health and safety committees, and the selection of health and safety representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The workplace arrangements provide mechanisms for the health and safety representatives of the shipboard work groups to work with shipboard management in ensuring safe working practices and in identifying and eliminating work hazards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not intend to describe these arrangements in detail. However, it is important to note a number of aspects in relation to the powers of a health and safety representative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The representative has the power to issue a provisional improvement notice requiring the person in command to take corrective action to stop or to avoid an unsafe practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the person in command and a health and safety representative cannot agree on the solution to a problem, the bill provides for intervention by an inspector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, if the representative believes there is an immediate threat to health and safety, the representative may order a cessation of the activity in question. This action can only be taken in an emergency and only if a supervisor cannot immediately be located.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cessation of work must be immediately reported to a supervisor so that an assessment can be made as to whether it is safe to resume the activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Standards and codes of practice</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important aspect of the bill, in terms of the government's commitment to encouraging a uniform national approach to OHS, is that it provides for the adoption of suitable standards and codes of practice which have been declared by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, account will also need to be taken of the standards imposed on shipping by international maritime safety conventions and international labour conventions, through the Navigation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inspectorate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the legislation's co-regulatory approach, which I have already outlined, emphasises cooperation in ensuring health and safety in the workplace, there needs to be effective enforcement of standards. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) will have inspectorate responsibilities under the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA has extensive experience in dealing with health and safety matters on Australian and foreign ships in its administration of the Navigation Act and the judgement and skills of AMSA's marine surveyors are widely acknowledged throughout the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMSA is developing appropriate OHS training courses for its surveyors, to reinforce their existing knowledge and experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appeals</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for appeals against the decisions of inspectors. Appeals may be made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, referred to in the bill as the `reviewing authority'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sanctions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that financial penalties can be imposed on employers or employees who breach the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manufacturers and suppliers will also be liable to prosecution and fines for contravening the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a health and safety representative abuses his or her powers, the representative can be disqualified for up to five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, over the past decade the Labor Government has introduced a number of far-reaching reforms for the shipping industry and the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms have resulted in large productivity gains and significant improvements in industry sector competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the shipping industry, there has been nearly a 40 per cent reduction in crew sizes on modern ships, compared with the situation ten years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is another step in the reform program. It will bring the maritime industry into line with the modern OHS arrangements applicable in the states and in Commonwealth employment, ensuring a safer working environment for seafarers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This, in turn, will further reduce costs to the maritime industry and the many industries it serves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this bill makes a number of consequential amendments to the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They relate to changes to the name, functions and constitution of the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority. The authority will now be called the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority, to reflect the expanded range of responsibilities which it will perform upon enactment of the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of this bill are described in detail in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MARITIME LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this Bill is to complete the process of bringing Australia's maritime zones into line with those to which Australia is entitled under international law as reflected in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Bill makes changes to existing law in four principal areas. These are establishment of rights in an exclusive economic zone, adoption of a revised definition of the continental shelf, assertion of rights in a contiguous zone and adoption of new international legal provisions for the drawing of territorial sea baselines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal legislation to be amended is the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. The Bill amends, in a consequential way, a number of other pieces of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Seas and Submerged Lands Act refers to the 1958 Geneva Conventions on Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf. References to those Conventions are no longer appropriate. In 1982 a new United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was adopted and signed by Australia. Australia has not yet ratified the Convention. That Convention, however, now has 56 ratifications and is likely to enter into force in the near future (it needs 60 ratifications to do so). It is, apart from the provisions relating to mining of the deep seabed, generally accepted as reflective of international law. The Government considers that in relation to maritime zones the Convention should govern Australian practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, consultations are taking place under the auspices of the Secretary-General of the United Nations with a view to overcoming some of the difficulties that have arisen under the Convention in relation to the provisions dealing with deep seabed mining. If these consultations are successful Australia and other developed States will be in a position to give serious consideration to ratifying the Convention and hence ensuring that it is universally accepted as the law on the subject. It is therefore appropriate, at this time, for Australia to amend its domestic law to bring its practice in relation to maritime zones into conformity with that provided for in the 1982 Convention. As I indicated earlier Australia considers the maritime zone aspects of the Convention to be reflective of customary international law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has, over the years, gradually asserted its various maritime entitlements under international law. Thus, in 1983 certain territorial sea baselines were proclaimed and in 1990 a 12 nautical mile territorial sea was established in place of the previous 3 nautical mile territorial sea. As long ago as 1979 Australia established a 200 nm fishing zone. The current Bill will complete the process of bringing Australia's maritime zones up-to-date. It replaces operative provisions in Commonwealth legislation which refer to the 1958 Conventions with references to the 1982 Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes clear that Australia asserts the full rights to which it is entitled under international law in a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. As stated in the preamble to the Bill, the rights that Australia has in such a zone include not just sovereign rights over both living and non-living resources but also jurisdiction as provided for in international law in relation to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, marine scientific research and protection and preservation of the marine environment. The sovereign rights and the jurisdiction which a coastal State possesses in its exclusive economic zone in regard to these matters are set out in detail in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, the relevant parts of which form a schedule to the Bill. It will be for future legislation to deal expressly with matters such as pollution control in the exclusive economic zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also adopts the definition of the continental shelf in the 1982 Convention. The 1958 Convention defines the outer limit of the continental shelf in terms of a depth of 200 metres or beyond that to a depth capable of exploitation. This open ended definition has proved unsatisfactory and customary international law has recognised that the limit of the continental shelf is the edge of the continental margin, and that it does not include the deep seabed. The 1982 Convention contains in Article 76 a precise definition of the continental shelf. This is a minimum 200 nautical miles regardless of the physical configuration of the shelf. Beyond that distance, where the configuration of the continental shelf allows, however, the limit may extend to a distance not exceeding 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath. This limit is calculated either by reference to the depth of sediments or the distance from the foot of the continental slope, defined by gradient. Adoption of the 1982 definition will enable Australia to claim a larger total area of continental shelf than under the 1958 Convention. The gains made by adopting the new definition outweigh any potential minor losses and will bring Australian legislation into conformity with internationally accepted principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also for the first time in Commonwealth legislation deals expressly with a contiguous zone. This zone extends from the limit of the territorial sea to a distance no greater than 24 nm from the territorial sea baselines. It is a zone in which a coastal State can exercise rights of control to prevent infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and to punish infringement of the above laws committed within its territory or territorial sea. It is envisaged that specific legislation such as the customs or quarantine legislation will in due course be amended to assert more fully the rights to which Australia is entitled in such a zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends in a consequential way a number of Acts as set out in Schedule 1. These amendments mostly relate to the definition of `continental shelf' in those pieces of legislation so as to remove references to the 1958 Convention. One amendment of particular note is the alteration of the adjacent area boundary under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act in relation to Tasmania and Western Australia. This will ensure that the operation of that Act extends to all the areas of continental shelf which Australia is entitled to claim under the 1982 definition. The existing adjacent area `picture frames' which are used in certain offshore area legislation do not extend far enough in those two areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relevant parts of the 1982 Convention are set out in schedule 2 to the Bill and will form part of the revised Seas and Submerged Lands Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the passage of this legislation reflects the need for Australia with its significant interests as both a coastal and maritime State to position itself to take advantage of developments in the law of the sea. Australia's action in this regard will promote further consolidation of coastal and maritime State rights and obligations as set out in the 1982 Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mention that the Bill does not affect the offshore constitutional settlement. The States and Northern Territory are consulted in relation to maritime issues and I expect this to continue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are discussing the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993, which contains proposals by the government to change the oath of allegiance given by Australians who take out citizenship in this country. To say that this is premature is an understatement indeed. It is well ahead of its time. If Australia were ever to become a republic, one might then change the oath of allegiance. Until that time occurs, there is no requirement, no need and no reason to change the oath of allegiance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reason the government is bringing this up now through this bill is to allocate to itself nearly a quarter of a million dollars to use towards its pro-republican campaign. That is what would flow from the passing of this bill. A sum of about a quarter of a million dollars would go to the government towards the support of its republican campaign so that it could continue to undermine the stability of this country in the way that it has been attempting to do in recent times. The government is using the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 as a vehicle to allocate that money to itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most significant things that a person could ever do in his or her life would be to take out citizenship of another country. It is not something that I have had to do; it is not something that I would ever expect to do. But I have been to a number of citizenship ceremonies. One cannot attend a good citizenship ceremony without being impressed by the significance of the occasion and by what it must mean to a person to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people who take out citizenship in this country because they have had to flee the country they were born in. They have had to find somewhere else to live. They would virtually have had to be without a home and without a country to belong to before they found somewhere else. This has gone on since the Second World War. A number of people came here, particularly from Europe, because they were displaced persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone I have ever spoken to who has taken out citizenship has been moved by the occasion and the circumstances. I think of the boat people who have come here from Vietnam in more recent times. I do not believe that any one of us sitting here could contemplate or understand the feelings of people who have fled their country of birth to travel to this country in boats that are unfit to leave a wharf in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people live here for many years before they finally take out citizenship. Having lived in this country for perhaps a long time while retaining citizenship of another country, people find it a very emotional experience when they finally make the commitment that Australia is where they belong. Some people have come here as young people to make a life for themselves; others have come here with young children to make a life for their family in this country because of the stability and opportunities that it offers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A citizenship ceremony, which has all of these emotions present in the air, is a very solemn, happy and moving occasion. All of that suddenly seems to be going out of the window, particular this year. I refer to the way in which the citizenship ceremonies are being run, at least in Canberra. I can only conclude that it is at the direction of the minister that the occasion should be downgraded and that the circumstances in which the ceremony takes place should no longer be presented as significant, but as a mere routine bureaucratic arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have been in the Senate, the ceremonies in Canberra were held in the theatrette at the National Library. They were very simple, but moving occasions and very worth while indeed. One of the members of federal parliament from this electorate always took part and was invited to speak. For many years Australian native plants have been handed out to those who have received their citizenship as a mark of the occasion. I think that still occurs. It was an occasion where people really felt that something important had occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, the citizenship ceremonies have been held at the Community Centre in Dickson. That also is a very suitable place and a nice occasion. I have been to a number of excellent ceremonies there that I and those who have taken out citizenship have enjoyed. Those involved have felt that they were doing something and that their commitment to this country was being recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took part in an excellent citizenship ceremony in the open at Commonwealth Park in Canberra on Australia Day this year. It was a great occasion. There was a citizenship ceremony at a Lions Club dinner, and I also attended one to mark Refugee Week at which the ACT Chief Minister officiated. All those who took out citizenship on that occasion were refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twelve other ceremonies have taken place at the offices of the department in Canberra and in the room about which Senator Bishop spoke earlier today. In fact, today 10 groups totalling 200 people are going through that room because the space is not big enough to hold a ceremony for all 200 people at once as there is in the Dickson Community Centre, in the theatrette of the National Library or in this building, as has already been pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of places in Canberra where one could hold a citizenship ceremony for 200 people with a little style, unlike the way it was done this morning in Canberra. Ten separate groups came in and out every few minutes, people were given a plant and they were sent on their way. No other people were invited to take part in the ceremony or to speak or to be in any way welcoming to the participants. I can only conclude that it is a deliberate policy of the Government to downgrade the nature of the ceremony. It has culminated today in this bill, which deals with changing the oath of allegiance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wonder why this bill is being brought in today. It is not urgent. One would have to say that it is to fill in time in the Senate&mdash;presumably while the government attempts to get its budget program in order. Why else would we be having this rushed through today when there are, according to the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, so many other things that ought to be dealt with? Every night when he has been on the news in recent times&mdash;petulant little man that he is&mdash;he has preached about the Senate holding up the budget and business generally and the Senate not doing this and that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer keeps abusing us for not dealing with important legislation. Yet today this bill to change the oath of allegiance is the No. 1 priority of the Government. Let the people of Australia note that. The republican push and changing the oath of allegiance are much more important to this government than any of the other things that it keeps talking about. Let us not forget that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no necessity to change the oath of allegiance at present. Nothing before us deals with changing the oath that we as members of parliament take when we are sworn in after each election. The reason is that in order for us to do so the constitution would have to be changed. Nothing before us changes the oath that a member of the armed services takes when entering the forces. I can only conclude that taking out citizenship of this country is less important to the government than any of these other things. I do not accept that as reasonable or correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This oath should not be changed unless there is a change to the structure of this country. I can see that one would have to change it in that event. In other words, if we became a republic, the oath as it presently stands would need to be amended. But that is not the case. For some reason, we have this matter before us today when the Treasurer keeps abusing the Senate for not dealing with the important business of the Government. He should be told what we are actually doing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone should tell the Treasurer that this morning we passed nine bills. It was a pretty good morning in the Senate. I am not suggesting that they should not have been dealt with. The protection of the sea bills were important and warranted the attention of the Senate. But we are now considering the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 as the next most important thing to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not deal with things such as dual nationality, which is important and has some substance; it just deals with changing the oath of allegiance to fit in with some other agenda. I refer to the oath and the pledge, as it is called, for the future. The present oath of allegiance is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>That recognises the constitutional structure of this country and its institutions. Within it the person taking out citizenship makes his or her own personal declaration: `I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen'. That is what one would expect it to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pledge that we are now given contains no commitment&mdash;nothing! It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward, under God,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no substance to it, and anybody reading it would know that. One can only wonder why the government would come forward with a pledge in that form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth having a little look at the words that we are discussing. The oath of allegiance, which is a solemn appeal to God and a solemn commitment to some person to some thing, is being abandoned. It is an attestation of the truth of what one is saying and of the binding character of the promise to testify on oath. An oath of allegiance has some significance and depth to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that the word `pledge' is a solemn promise. But the word `pledge' has other meanings&mdash;such as a pledge of aid; a pledge or a security for the payment of debt. Although it has a meaning of promise, it is not a word used in that fashion and it is not a word that has any real depth or meaning to it. We are not talking about such a concept when talking about taking out citizenship of this country. One can have a `promise'&mdash;I accept that word&mdash;which is a declaration with respect to the future that one will do or not do, or give or not give something. In my opinion, a promise has much more meaning to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `to swear an oath', as it is worded at the present time, means to make a solemn declaration with an oath of allegiance to Almighty God. It does not have the same meaning when used by many people who make the affirmation, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I solemnly and sincerely declare that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>The commitment to this country should recognise the constitutional status of the country. It should show some understanding of what a person is doing in taking out the oath of allegiance and making one's commitment to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new wording, the oath of affirmation becomes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From this time forward,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose democratic beliefs I share,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose rights and liberties I respect, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whose laws I will uphold and obey.</PARA>
<PARA>I heard another form of words recently that I think is worth bringing into the debate. It was given by emeritus Professor Ralph Elliott in a radio program in Canberra when he was asked what he thought about the change in the words. Acknowledging the Labor Party's attitude to this&mdash;which I think is probably not his own&mdash;by leaving out reference to the head of state, his suggested words were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hereby solemnly promise (before God) to be a loyal citizen of Australia, to obey its laws, to cherish and safeguard its democratic institutions, and to foster mutual respect between the country, all its people and myself.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a much more personal way of wording the commitment. It puts much more of oneself into it than the words that have been given to the Senate to consider today. I am not suggesting that Professor Elliott would change the present oath&mdash;I certainly would not&mdash;but at least that type of wording is a far more personal commitment than the words given to us today, which I regard as totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, there are two aspects to this matter; the words themselves and the complete lack of depth and meaning to the pledge that is presented, and the government's attitude towards the ceremonies which are conducted to enable people to take out citizenship. I hope the Senate will throw out this bill. The matter could be looked at at an appropriate time when, if ever, there was to be a change in the constitutional status of this country. This has not yet occurred and will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us at this time has no place in the Senate. There is no requirement and no need to change the oath of allegiance for Australian citizenship. I ask the government to withdraw the bill and to not bring it forward either in this fashion or at all until such time as it would naturally fit into a constitutional change in the country. I think the mere fact that the other oaths I have mentioned are not being amended and are not being capable of being amended indicates that there is no real substance to this, other than to try to boost the government's republicanism push and to enable it, quite wrongly and quite falsely, to get hold of taxpayers' funds to help them push this along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other people who want to speak in this debate and there are other reasons that people have given as to why the matter should not be dealt with. To me it is quite simple and straightforward and the wording proposed I find appalling in any event. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike some of the previous speakers, I consider the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill to be an extremely important piece of legislation because it is dragging this nation state of Australia into the 21st century. It was only 45 years ago that this country established its own right of citizenship. I was a mere child at the time this happened. It took a further 25 years, and it was under the Whitlam government, before the oath was changed to reflect the monarch as the monarch of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are 20 years later&mdash;one can hardly say we are galloping along to reform&mdash;actually making changes that are relevant to Australia in 1993. They probably were relevant to Australia in 1973, but because of the way the parliament was structured at the time it could not happen. It can hardly be said that what has been proposed in the chamber this afternoon is revolutionary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I claim to have more authority to speak in support of this measure than the vast majority of my colleagues in this place or the other place. I am one of the few elected representatives of the parliament of Australia who has gone through a citizenship ceremony. I have not been as lucky as those who were born in this wonderful land. I came here by choice. But I am perhaps luckier than most because of where my mother was as at the time of my birth. That is a different story and we will not canvass an argument about the two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had to think long and seriously in my adopted homeland before I took the oath of allegiance&mdash;before I became a citizen of this country. I had made the decision long before I took out citizenship to remain permanently in this land. The hardest decision I had to make was whether to pledge allegiance to the Queen. The oath says the Queen of Australia. They were the words of the oath that I used. We should recognise that people around the world recognise Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of Great Britain, or even more specifically, as the Queen of England. The oath says `Queen of Australia'. We do have a Queen of Australia because it is in our law, but we do not have an Australian queen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extremely important piece of legislation for multicultural Australia in 1993. It has taken a long time to get here. I am aware that there were two previous attempts to bring about this change under the administration of Bob Hawke. Both those attempts failed. I certainly hope that on this occasion the Senate will make the decision to endorse this bill and send it off to the House of Representatives. Sixty days after receiving royal assent it will become law and new citizens who take the oath next year, when it effectively becomes law, will be espousing words that truly and honestly reflect modern day Australia and not the anachronism of colonial Australia from where this developed. Australian citizenship has been in existence for only 45 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are number of other points that I want to say about this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The republic in Ireland has been a success because it can develop as a nation. Previously, Ireland has been held back as a nation because it was being controlled from outside.

It was mentioned by a previous speaker that there is a private members bill on the floor of the Canadian parliament talking about the changes to the Canadian oath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is extremely important to the 990,000 Australians who have not taken that big leap to vow allegiance to this country or, as it presently stands, to vow allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. There are people, many of whom come from my birth place, Ireland, who just cannot bring themselves to swearing allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many Italians whom I know of who cannot bring themselves to swearing allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II because they, like most of the Australian population, recognise that Queen Elizabeth II, her gracious majesty, is Queen of England. They do not recognise her as Queen of Australia. We do not see her frequently, and technically speaking she is the Queen of Australia only when she is actually in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would hope that when this bill is enacted and becomes law those 990,000 people recognised in the 1986 census will take the step to make the final commitment to this country. I hope that they will go through with the ceremonies that all of us as members of parliament attend from time to time. I hope that in the next few years there will be so many people taking Australian citizenship that the venues for the ceremonies will not be big enough to cater for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My local authority in Western Australia, the City of Wanneroo, holds perhaps the biggest citizenship ceremonies in Western Australia.

It seems that I have been blessed in terms of my birthright and living not only in Australia but particularly in Western Australia and in the magnificent City of Wanneroo. We hold magnificent ceremonies out in the open air on Australia Day. When this new oath comes in next year I hope that not just 300 people but 400 or 500 people at a time will take out Australian citizenship. The people referred to in the 1986 census will have the opportunity to make a complete and total commitment to the land that we as migrants have chosen to live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been alleged that the new pledge will be weaker than the present oath. I certainly do not see it that way, but then I am an agnostic anyway and I have a problem with taking oaths. How meaningful are oaths to people like me in the community? I know that some people put great store in the taking of oaths and I do not denigrate them for that. Their wishes will be complied with under new provisions in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, there is absolutely no difference between a pledge and an oath or affirmation. Some of us, when taking office in this place, go through such a process rather than taking an oath. Certainly, there is no difference in law. I do not know why people are getting a head of steam up about whether we call it a pledge or an oath. Because the government was concerned about allegations that were made, it sought advice from the Attorney-General's Department. That advice reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the term `oath' as currently used in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 nor the term `pledge' as proposed to be used in the act has any technical legal meaning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The term `pledge' does have a technical legal meaning relating to the delivery of goods as security. However, it is clearly not being used in that sense.</PARA>
<PARA>The advice also makes reference to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS>. The advice reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">'Oath' is defined, in the relevant sense, as "1. a solemn appeal to God, or to some revered person or thing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I did not write this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in attestation of the truth of a statement or the binding character of a promise; 2. a statement or promise strengthened by such an appeal".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">'Pledge' is defined as "a solemn promise of something, or to do or refrain from doing something".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both words therefore connote a solemn promise.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill provides for two forms of pledge&mdash;the first includes the words `under God'; and the second does not include those words. People will be able to chose which form of pledge they want to make. Each pledge will have the same meaning and same standing in the laws of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opening comments I made reference to my birthplace. It is not only people from my birthplace who have problems with pledging allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. My wife also had the same problems. Finally she took the decision and became an Australian citizen, pledging her commitment under the oath as it was written at that time. But even she, born in London within sight of Buckingham Palace, the Queen's residence, had problems in pledging allegiance to the Queen when becoming a citizen of her adopted homeland. This is despite the fact that she was brought up to recognise the sovereignty of the Queen. Of course, everybody knows that London is the capital of England and as a child she recognised clearly and plainly that the Queen is first and foremost the Queen of England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Queen is the Queen of Australia is only a secondary consideration; it is only really words on paper. We can surround the Queen with bunches of wattle or whatever, but that fact will remain. Countries with access to modern forms of communications&mdash;be they newspapers, television or radio&mdash;recognise the Queen as the Queen of England or the Queen of the United Kingdom but not the Queen of Australia.

They are opposed to the proposition that persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and accept these obligations.

They are opposed to a pledge which says `From this time forward under God'. They are opposed to the proposition that people who want to become Australian citizens should swear: `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey'. Why should anybody be opposed to those propositions?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present oath swears allegiance to the Queen.

It does not make the Queen anything that she is presently not, that is, Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia. It does nothing in respect of either of those things. It does not make Australia a republic nor does it take it towards being a republic and it does not remove the Queen from her present position as Queen of Australia.

It is a bill that I would have thought would have had the support of everybody across the board. It is a bill which former Senator Tate had much to do with. He is a person who needs to be given praise and acknowledgment for the work he did on this Australian citizenship bill. He is a person who is deeply religious, a person dedicated to Australia, a person who is one of the most respected senators ever to serve in this Senate and a person who produced this bill with all those aspirations that it manifests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just say something about my good friend and associate Senator McKiernan, who was taken to task for swearing allegiance to the Queen to serve in this parliament. Senator McKiernan has made a great contribution while he has been here. He has an Irish background. He would not be alone in Australia, I hope, in having some connection with that great and magnificent country. The suggestion that he in some way swore allegiance as a means of obtaining something that he would not otherwise have obtained casts an aspersion on his character which is completely undeserved. He is as loyal and as great an Australian as any other person in this chamber, and I think that ought to be stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point he made is right. This is an important bill. We cannot go around being economic rationalists all our lives and we cannot go around being what is a derivation of that, that is, social rationalists who say, `There is no way we can improve the present situation except by eliminating more things that go to manifest the greater aspirations of the heart and soul of the human condition. We can't have that. It is unimportant that we should want to become citizens, that we should want to emphasise our citizenship rather than our subjugation to the Queen'. That is what we do when we swear the present oath of allegiance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important bill. If one looks at its terms, it is very hard to see how people can vote against it. As I say, it has nothing to do with the republic. It has nothing to do with in any way insulting the Queen, a monarch for whom we all have great love and respect. That is irrelevant to the present debate. It is not irrelevant to the present debate that people who vote against this will be voting against the propositions that are set out in clause 3 and the schedule in clause 8. The schedule contains that pledge&mdash;that beautiful form of prayer almost&mdash;that people who want to become Australian citizens are asked to take and which manifests very clearly what is expected of them and which is very understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pledge must be very plain as to what people are doing, very understandable in the context of where it is sworn and very clear as to what it means. People do not swear allegiance to any particular person who may or may not be in a country. Rather, they swear that they will be loyal to Australia and its people; that they will be loyal to Australia's democratic beliefs, which they share; that they will be loyal to the proposition that rights and liberties should be respected; and that they will be loyal to the proposition that laws that Australia or the states of Australia proclaim will be upheld and obeyed. It is a very simple, very effective, wonderful pledge and one that is historic. </PARA>

The fact remains that the Queen is head of Australia. The government might not like it and might do everything that it can to oppose it, but it does not alter that fact. The government is getting too far in front of itself by bringing this legislation in now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sort of vague and insubstantial statement; it does not really mean a great deal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the argument put by the other side. The question emerged as a political concern in the early 1980s when the Fraser government decided to institute national consultations on citizenships. The consultations produced evidence that suggested that a large number of permanent residents were not taking out citizenship because the government's 1983 bill was directed toward encouraging residents to take out citizenship by reducing the language requirement from adequate to basic and by reducing the residency requirement from three to two years. But what was discovered in that exercise was that people were concerned that if they took out citizenship in Australia, they would have to renounce their original citizenship and that that would not allow them to go back. That was one of the main reasons for that inquiry concluding that people were not taking Australian citizenship. So it had nothing to do with the Queen or an Australian oath of allegiance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, and I also wish to thank other senators for allowing me to make my first speech. May I say at the outset that I am very proud to stand here as a new senator representing the state of Tasmania and the people of Australia generally. It is with a degree of humility that I take up this task but it is one that I will endeavour to perform to the fullest extent. Hopefully, I will meet the expectations the public have of their elected representatives in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My pursuit of political life is born out of my working class background and the struggles that have confronted ordinary Australians over the time that this country has developed. They are struggles that I will continue to pursue during my time as a senator in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was born in the west coast mining town of Queenstown, Tasmania. My father worked as a fitter and turner at Mt Lyell copper mine and my mother was from a farming family in the north of the state. I attended school at the Hagley Farm and Prospect high schools. However, I was no great scholar and left school at the end of my third year of high school. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and it was a good place too. During my time in Queensland I learnt to be a shearer. This became my job and life for the next 14 years. This was a period of great learning for me and contained many lessons about life. It was a time I enjoyed enormously and remember fondly. I worked throughout most states of Australia and met some wonderful characters and made many great friendships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also my first real introduction to the trade union movement, something that was to have a profound effect on me in time to come. In the late 1970s I returned to live in Tasmania, with my interest in politics growing by the day. I joined the Labor Party in 1982 and became heavily involved in the Tasmanian branch of the ALP from that time on. In 1989 I became state secretary of the Australian Timber Workers Union, which is now a division of the CFMEU, the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy Union, a position I held until elected to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provided me with the opportunity to represent workers in an industry where employers had neglected to address matters such as training and education, that had pay rates that were not commensurate with the tasks performed, and where there was no recognition of skills and no career advancement opportunities. During my four years as secretary I saw many changes that were brought about by the efforts of the union&mdash;changes that not only improved conditions for workers but also improved the whole work process and led to greater productivity and efficiency within the industry. I believe I can say quite categorically that none of those changes would have occurred without the efforts of the union. I would like to congratulate the leadership of the union at both the national and state level on the great contribution they made and to thank them for the support they gave me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, not all employers would accept such processes. One example of this is the APPM dispute that occurred at Burnie. For the first time in a long time in Australia's industrial history, workers were confronted with the type of bastardry that the opposition would have us believe does not exist in this country&mdash;where an employer sought to deny workers the fundamental right to be collectively represented and organised. To their great credit, the overwhelming majority of those workers took the issue on and fought for what was right. They should be commended for their effort, their unity and their commitment to protect that fundamental Australian democratic right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, industrial relations will be an area of keen interest to me. It is with the knowledge of the APPMs of this world that I have often noted, and with some amusement, the continual castigation of the trade union movement by members of the opposition. This action, plus the industrial relations policy it went to the election with, simply does not gel with the calls it now makes for fairer treatment of the working class Australians. It is policies such as those and the actions of many of Australia's employers that maintain my commitment to the trade union movement. I will do whatever I can to ensure its survival and the continuation of its role of representing workers of this country. In saying that, I do not imply a disinterest in or lack of understanding of the concerns and aspirations of Australian business, nor a disbelief in profit making or business success. I do understand and recognise these things because I know that without successful businesses there is no employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the opposition still clings to the belief that we have to get rid of unions to free up the labour market and allow bosses to sit down with their workers individually and supposedly work out a fair deal for all. However, one of the major problems with that approach is the management in many of Australia's companies and businesses. Because of their lack of foresight, initiative and general incompetence, to them a free labour market means reducing wages and conditions of workers and not working smarter or developing new products or, indeed, seeking new markets or improving the quality of products they produce. Of course, this leads to claims about the current industrial relations system&mdash;the system that is supposed to give unions all power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give an example of how it does not and how employers are exploiting workers even under this presumably restrictive system. This example involved four unemployed sawmill workers who, in seeking work, had a proposition put to them that they could set up their own business and operate their own sawmill. The proposer of this deal would sell them the logs necessary to cut the timber and then would on-sell the finished product for them. Of course, they had no money to start with, so the proposer would lend them the first month's rent for the sawmill as well as some other money for outgoings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were informed that they could not draw wages until the mill made a profit but, in the meantime, they would receive $20 a week from this new found friend to pay for their petrol, et cetera, ensuring that they could still collect social security. This continued for nine months and, according to the bookkeeper&mdash;who just happened to be the proposer&mdash;the mill never made a profit, despite all of the timber being sold and no wages being paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that sort of thing that really leads me to maintain a great commitment to what is right for workers in this country. Those workers were not members of a union at the time. They finally sought the assistance of the CFMEU and, even under the current system, the union had great difficulty in doing something about it because of the way the deal was set up, the way this person was technically avoiding the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The matter was reported to the Department of Industrial Relations and also to the Department of Social Security&mdash;with little result. The union is now taking the matter to court to try to bring about some justice for these workers, who were trying to create an opportunity for themselves and who were being blatantly ripped off by some grub of an employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could outline numerous such circumstances that occurred just during my time as a union secretary. So imagine how these types of employers would operate under the free labour market system being proposed by the opposition! John Howard's proposed office of employee advocate would have been the only area of employment growth and would have probably become one of the largest industrial relations departments in history. Even then, it would still not have been able to deal with the exploitation that would have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should not be forgotten that the people of Australia rejected the opposition's industrial relations policy on 13 March. They were not prepared, even in the face of difficult employment times, to support policies which would have made things worse: they would have reduced their wages, put more of them out of work and placed them in a position of great vulnerability. As honourable senators are aware, the current system, whilst not perfect, has delivered stability and, in many respects, fairness; however, it can and will be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is currently reviewing industrial relations legislation and, much to the disgust of those on the other side, it is consulting the trade union movement, along with industry. We recognise that, to have a process that can deliver in the interests of the country, we must take account of all views. The opposition, on the other hand, would not have done that. It would have simply legislated to outlaw unionism as Australians know it today. It would have reduced the current award system to a state of worthlessness; indeed, I believe it would have ultimately abolished the award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the outlook for employment growth in the short-term future, the exploitation of Australian workers would have gone out of control. We would have ended up with a society of haves and have-nots. And what would that have done for the economy? Not much, I think. People would be less able to save, with less to spend, and the result would be additional job losses to those already occurring through productivity and efficiency gains. This is not what Australia needs, and that is why Labor won the last election&mdash;because Australians believe in a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on the issue of fairness, I feel it appropriate that I speak about the achievements of 10 years of Labor in government and, in particular, about the current budget. When we came to office in 1983, Australia was an inward looking, protectionist, inefficient, uncompetitive country with double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and a confrontationist industrial relations system that had industrial disputation at record levels. We had poor education and training levels&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Panizza, the ACTU has done a lot to improve the lot of business in this country. We had a Third World pattern of exports and a government&mdash;the Fraser government&mdash;that chose to ignore the potential trade opportunities within the Asian region. A decade later the Australian economy has been transformed. Certainly we still have high unemployment, but the rest of the picture is dramatically changed. Our economic fundamentals have been dramatically improved through building a much more competitive economy, along with a cooperative approach to industrial relations; greatly enhanced levels of education and training, research and development and export assistance; a much more competitive business tax system; and a government that is promoting and pursuing trade opportunities in Asia as well as the rest of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the lowest level of inflation in 30 years; interest rates which are the lowest in 20 years; international competitiveness up by over 30 per cent since 1983; industrial disputes at the lowest level ever recorded; productivity increasing at a healthy 2.5 per cent per annum; exports of manufactured goods rising at 20 per cent per annum; service exports that now represent 20 per cent of total exports; and many small and medium manufacturing companies which are competing in overseas markets. In short, we have a much more innovative, productive and competitive economy than 10 years ago and, as a result, Australia is better placed to advance the welfare and living standards of its people. We have also built a much fairer Australia, with those on low incomes and those in need receiving greater assistance through better targeting of welfare and community services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, during its 10 years in office, has been about vision and a clear sense of direction. We set out to transform the Australian economy, and we have. Australia is on a fundamentally different path now to that which it had followed for most of this century, and Australians have accepted this change in direction. Even the opposition, which governed Australia for most of this century and made it what it was up to 1983, has fully accepted this change, and its criticisms are not about the directions we have taken, but rather that we are not demolishing quickly enough the structure it put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But where do we go from here? The government's objectives are straightforward enough. They are: to increase the rate of economic and employment growth, thus increasing real incomes and reducing unemployment; to enhance the level of our domestic savings, which is an essential element of addressing our balance of payments problem; to continue the process of making Australia a creative, innovative manufacturing nation; to improve the international environment for our export industries by new and improved international trade arrangements; to establish a new vocational education and training system which will better meet the needs and priorities of industry; and to continue to enhance social justice in our society. Therefore, there should be no doubt about where the government is taking the nation. The record shows that we are headed in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures have been continued in the latest budget which, despite all the claims, maintains a fairer society and yet continues the program of returning this country's economy to a stable and vibrant position for the future. Of course, we have not solved all of our problems, and one of the fundamental issues that we must continue to address is that of unemployment. Although we have put in place substantial labour market programs for the next 12 months, including the continuation of programs such as newstart, jobclubs, LEAP, NIES and so on&mdash;which have been very successful in getting people into full-time work&mdash;we cannot rest there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I believe there are some areas that must be given special consideration. In particular, we should look at imports which come into this country. I do not believe we can continue to allow imports to come into this country without a greater requirement for identification of the country of origin. The buy Australian program must be revitalised and the loopholes that allow the current system to be rorted must be removed. We must be able to guarantee Australians that when they seek to buy Australian they really can buy Australian. This is a matter I intend to pursue with some vigour, particularly in the area of forest products, which represent around 10 per cent of this country's imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, part of the process of addressing import replacement will be business investment and development. However, a lot of Australian companies seem to be sitting on their hands in this respect. But there are now good reasons why investment should commence: profit shares are at quite high levels and rising; and the gross operating surpluses of trading enterprises are at high levels compared to this stage of recovery from the previous downturns in the mid-1970s and 1980s. It is also 22 per cent higher than it was in March 1983 when Labor came to office. Real unit labour costs have been virtually stable. All this, coupled with low inflation and interest rates and further business tax concessions in the budget, has provided a better business investment outlook for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget measures are, of course, important. Together with business tax concessions announced in the One Nation package, they form a comprehensive array of incentives. They also provide a very competitive tax regime compared to those of our trading partners, even our Asian trading partners. The new company tax rates are 33 per cent, down from 39 per cent&mdash;something the opposition was going to increase to 42 per cent had it won the election. I must say that there have been some interesting comments from business about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy on which this year's budget has been based is to enhance growth in the short term through further expenditure for job creation and tax cuts, which will lead us into a longer term recovery that will come as the world economy picks up. What I now find difficult to understand&mdash;in fact, almost inconceivable&mdash;is the current position being adopted by the opposition in respect of this budget. On the one hand it claims to want fiscal responsibility, yet on the other it is opposing the government's revenue raising measures. I can understand its disappointment at losing the supposedly unlosable election, but Australians should now judge it for the reckless disregard it is showing for the welfare of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern to me is our economic relationship with New Zealand. While I believe it is necessary and important, I find it difficult to accept the imbalance that lies in the employment related area. I know that the Senate has conducted inquiries into some aspects of this, but the problem still seems to exist. Regardless of the explanation, I do not see why the people of New Zealand should be treated differently from people from other countries when it comes to working in Australia, or vice versa for that matter. It should be noted that, on current figures that can be identified, the New Zealand work force in Australia represents about two per cent of our current unemployed people, and I believe this is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to two other key issues facing Australia today. The first relates to land rights and native title, which have been highlighted by the recent Mabo decision. In essence, this decision provided us with the opportunity to appropriately address something that has been wrong for so long. The unfortunate thing about the debate is that some interest groups have tried to politicise it. All sorts of instant experts have come out of the woodwork, none more notable that Hugh Morgan of Western Mining. He made all sorts of statements about land claims but there was one claim he was not telling us about&mdash;that was the greatest claim jumping exercise in Australia's mining history, and he lost. However, regardless of all the politicising and disruptive tactics of some, the government will introduce legislation that will do something genuine about this longstanding and unacceptable situation. I hope that all honourable senators will support such steps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to speak about Australia becoming a republic. This is something I have supported for a long time, not because of any disrespect for our historic links with Britain or the monarchy; rather, I support it for the reasons that it should occur. This country has developed socially to the point where it is necessary for us to become a republic if we are to gain a sense of completeness. For me, it is the only way that a full sense of pride can exist for all of Australia's people. It will be like the completion of a long journey or making the final payment on something one has never owned. Regardless of people's views, I do not think anyone could reject the notion of having an Australian as head of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the most recent event of Sydney winning the 2000 Olympic Games brings home the importance of having a head of country and, indeed, a flag that would truly be our own. I am sure it would seem odd to other countries that, following our competing against Manchester, England, for the Olympics, we then turn around and have the Queen of England open our Olympics. There are no valid reasons why we should not become a republic. We should get on with the job and instil even greater pride in this great country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to thank my wife, who is here tonight, for the support she has given me and to congratulate her on becoming the first woman to be elected as a state secretary of a union representing workers in the timber industry. I would also like to acknowledge my trade union colleagues who are here tonight and to thank them for travelling so far and for making that effort. I would simply like to say to them, `Keep up the struggle; the workers need you'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before Senator Murphy's initial contribution we were debating the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993. I was saying that there are about one million people in Australia who have immigrated to Australia and who have not become Australian citizens. Sixty-one per cent of those people have Irish, British or New Zealand origins. As I said before, those people felt that they were part of the society and part of Australia, but had not become Australian citizens. A further study showed that 40 to 60 per cent of residents from non-English speaking Mediterranean countries, north-western Europe and Third World countries became citizens almost immediately. Overall, 80 per cent of those people from those countries became Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study showed that the most important reason why people did not become citizens was that many countries did not allow dual citizenship. I suppose people needed to feel that if they were not satisfied here, they could go back to their original country. The study also showed that the oath or affirmation were not significant reasons why migrants did not become Australians. The myth that has been perpetrated from the government side of the house that they did not become citizens because they had some fear of, or opposition to, taking the oath of allegiance is simply not correct. The government believes that it has a monopoly on history. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not desire to give any credit to this government, the Democrats and other people in the community who want, in an evolutionary way, to move forward the development of the Australian identity. Opposition senators want to oppose it because they are petrified that the present government&mdash;in particular, the present Prime Minister&mdash;may get some political credit and some community recognition for these proposals. This is really a political campaign to ensure that the present Prime Minister and the government are denigrated in every way possible. What we see today&mdash;and it is in this report of the committee&mdash;is quite astonishing in that those opposite again assert that this bill is a disguise, a front and a diversion from the real issues. </PARA>

We have heard them all the time saying this is the number one issue, which we have never denied, but that the only issue those opposite want to deal with is the economic issue and they say all of these other issues are diversions. The Australian people are quite happy to participate in either side of the debate. They can deal with it. If Australian people had listened to the opposition's view back in the 1890s, we would never have got Federation. In the early 1890s we had the worst economic crises in this country's history and, at the same time, we developed the Federation. We were able to have referendums to establish the Federation of Australia, despite Australia going through the worst economic crisis since white settlement began.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is astonishing that those opposite can assert now that issues such as this are a diversion. I think this parliament is quite capable of dealing with many issues. I still think opposition senators are stupid. I would not mind their saying that they are opposing this on other issues, but to say that it is a diversion, that people cannot handle this issue or that those opposite cannot handle it, is just absurd. The parliament is here to handle many different issues every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This simple bill contains what we now call the pledge of commitment as a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia, as well as the preamble, as amended by the Australian Democrats, which reads, `recognising that Australian citizenship represents formal membership of the community of the Commonwealth of Australia; and Australian citizenship as a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations, uniting all Australians, while respecting their diversity; and persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations by pledging loyalty to Australia and its people, and by sharing their democratic beliefs, and by respecting their rights and liberties, and by upholding and obeying the laws of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill sets out the pledge of commitment that people swear when they become citizens of Australia at citizenship ceremonies around Australia. I, like every member of this chamber, have attended citizenship ceremonies at which people have taken out citizenship under the existing oath of allegiance. I believe&mdash;I have certainly had anecdotal evidence given to me; I cannot prove the numbers&mdash;that there are migrants in this country who will not take out citizenship because they want to swear allegiance to Australia rather than appearing, as they see it, to swear allegiance to the Queen of England. There have been reports in the press that, in the last few months since this legislation was introduced into the parliament, people turning up at citizenship ceremonies to become citizens of Australia have been upset that they cannot use the new oath of commitment. This is an indication that people want to be loyal to Australia and want to be able to take that pledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not interested in those people. It wants to use an oath of allegiance that is clearly written for the 19th century. This is indicative of where the politics of the opposition are. Its politics are the politics of the 19th century. It cannot cope with progressive, evolutionary change in respect of the identity of Australia, the feeling of pride that Australia can stand alone and the belief that Australians want to identify with their own symbols and not the symbols of another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in no way denigrates the role and standing of Her Majesty the Queen of Australia and Queen of Great Britain, but is a recognition of the fact that this country is evolving its own identity. All honourable senators opposite want to stop that because they have another political agenda. They just cannot conceive, and do not have the graciousness to say, that the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the present government may be doing the correct thing in respect of Australia's national identity. They do not want to concede to the government what they consider to be political capital. </PARA>

Opposition members have ended up like the Labor Party unfortunately was in the 1950s and 1960s: satisfied with being in permanent opposition, collecting the money for being here, but not really wanting to be in government.

It was Senator Schacht who moved the motion at the Hobart conference to make Australia an independent nation, as he called it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Senator Schacht who also brought down quite an interesting report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS>. When we are debating the independence of Australia, I invite Australians to look at that report because in that report Senator Schacht, the mover of the republican motion, also advocated a recommendation that Australians have access for domestic disputes to UN committees. For the first time since the passing of the Australia Act of 1986, when the Australian legal system became self-contained, Senator Schacht decided that the government should open up appeals by Australians in domestic disputes to foreign judges. Senator Evans has called this the new internationalist agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht claims that he treasures the independence of this nation and comes into this chamber and lectures us about the need to make Australia more independent. There is an interesting page in this report where Senator Schacht refers to the need to make a declaration under article 41 of the ICCPR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. By signing this particular article and removing the reservation, other countries for the first time have the right to make complaints against Australia and those complaints will be judged in a foreign court with foreign judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to Senator Schacht that there are many paradoxes in his character. He has been constantly opposed to censorship. I remember him constantly chiding Senator Walters over this matter but he wanted to censor political advertising. He wanted to censor the publication of Odgers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht reached the height of hypocrisy when he moved motions about the independence of Australia. He has reversed the philosophy of the Australia Act of 1986 and he has opened up the Australian legal system to foreign courts. I dare say that he will be recalled, to the extent that he will be recalled at all in Australian history, as the man who reversed the philosophy of the Australia Act and for the first time involved foreign judges in our legal system. So he should not speak to us about the independence of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another different point of philosophy that came through in Senator Schacht's speech. His concern was with what he called the developing Australian identity. That is the code that Senator Schacht and his colleagues use to say that they are unhappy with the current Australian identity. One can hold that view. I do not hold that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to Senator Schacht that a lot of Australians are very proud of their country, very proud of their history and very proud of their current identity. They do not believe, unlike the Paul Keatings and the Senator Schachts of this world, who are so worried about our current identity, that we need to develop it further. Certainly over a period of time things change and people change. I put to Senator Schacht that to suggest that something is wrong with the current identity of Australia is a philosophy or view not shared by most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subject of this debate is the oath. I congratulate my colleagues Senator Short, Senator Reid and Senator Boswell for the contributions they have made and the way they have analysed the oath which the government is wishing us to change to and the way they drew attention to the features where this oath seems to lack coherence. There are</PARA>
<PARA>two areas of the oath I find quite extraordinary. The first is&mdash;and Senator Bolkus will remember this&mdash;that there is nothing in this oath which suggests that we should be forswearing all other allegiances or putting Australia first and foremost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that if those opposite were going to come into this chamber and try to beat the patriotic drum&mdash;I must admit that given Senator Schacht's record of encouraging foreign judges to become involved in Australian disputes, it is a beat which sounds distinctly discordant to my ears&mdash;it would not be unreasonable that the section of the oath which the Labor Party removed in 1986, which had the phrase `forswearing all other allegiances', might have been incorporated. But of course it was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It was interesting that when Mr Abbott from Australians for a Constitutional Monarchy appeared before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs he put some views that there should be some amendments to the current oath. He suggested that the words should be along the lines of `forswearing all other allegiances'. When a representative of the Australian Republican Movement came before the committee I put to him, to make it clear, that this oath should be assertively more Australian. He said that he did not feel that was needed; in fact, he felt that could be regarded as a divisive element. If we are really wanting to beat the nationalist drum, surely those words, which have been part of the oath for a large number of years, should be included? Senator Short read the American oath to the chamber. It includes the phrase:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an assertively American republican oath. Of course, in Australia, under the somewhat equivocal nationalism of the Labor Party, such a sentiment is not acceptable. We see in the current oath that there is no element of any loyalty to any particular institution, constitution or head of state. That is another weakness of the oath of allegiance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, because of the nationalism that Senator Schacht tried to manifest in here, that there was a debate in the cabinet about whether the word `nation' should be included in the oath. Those great nationalists in the Labor Party&mdash;Mr Keating and his ministers&mdash;reflected on whether it was really politically correct to include the word `nation' in the oath. Former Senator Tate was kind enough to inform the committee investigating this bill that the Labor Party felt that the word `nation' did not have the right resonance for the current period. Again, it shows just how equivocal the Labor Party is on these particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney said that he felt this debate we are having today should not be confused with the republican debate. I think Senator Cooney was wrong. This is entirely part of the republican debate. Anyone who, like myself, has a great respect for Senator Cooney and the contributions he makes to debates would listen to his comments and think about them. But Senator Schacht made the point that the oath is indeed part and parcel of the Labor Party's republican push. It is part of that wider debate. We do not know what sort of republican constitution the Labor Party wishes to put forward to the Australian people. I believe, with good reason, that the Australian people are becoming increasingly nervous about the sort of republic that Mr Keating would have in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One person put it to me that the case against the republic could be summed up in two words&mdash;President Keating. I think it is a telling point that people are concerned about what sort of country Australia will become led by a man who has lowered the standards of his office to an all-time low, who attempts to politicise every major activity in this country, who speaks about our past history in a way which I think repulses most patriotic Australians and who goes home to Ireland and says he is returning home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the Senate where my home is. My home is here in Australia. When I return home, it is to my home here in Australia; I do not return home to Ireland. I make that point without any disrespect to my Irish grandparents who came out to Australia. They undoubtedly brought with them a lot of the Irish spirit which we so admire. But Ireland is not home to me. It may be home to Mr Keating, and I think most Australians wish that he would go home, and go quickly. Our home is here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It showed the quality of the man when Mr Keating came home after Australia won the Olympic Games&mdash;which gave all of us a great boost; what a great achievement it was&mdash;and immediately attempted to politicise the games. He tried to enlist the Olympic Games to the wider Labor agenda. The government backed off that particular issue pretty rapidly when the Australian public, through talkback radio, made known its view of Mr Keating's contribution to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The oath of allegiance is part of a wider debate on the republican issue. It is a desperate attempt to remove what the Labor Party sees as an offensive symbol in the oath of allegiance. I have to say that no people are faster to swear allegiance to Her Majesty than members of the Labor Party when they win office. When Mr Keating stabbed Mr Hawke in the back he was quickly up to Yarralumla to swear the oath of allegiance as Prime Minister. There was no concern or hesitation in the Labor Party at that time about any oath which contained a reference to Her Majesty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of final points. As a member of parliament I make a habit of attending as many citizenship ceremonies as I can, as indeed do Senator Short and my colleagues here. I have always been impressed by the diversity of people who are becoming Australian citizens. I spend some time speaking to them and listening to their views. Not one of them has ever expressed any concern about the current oath, and I have been to many citizenship occasions. This is a total furphy raised by the Labor Party in an attempt to pit Australians against Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are involved in a major debate about Australia's constitution. Australia today is a very tolerant, peaceful, multicultural society&mdash;a society which I believe is probably the envy of most countries around the world. Indeed, Tina Turner's song, which was played before the rugby league grand final, could equally be applied to this country&mdash;it is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Simply the Best</EMPHASIS>. We have come as far as we have because we have constantly built on the foundations of our history. I do not believe there has been a generation of Australians which has not been intensely proud of this nation and wanted to build it further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has never been a leader in Australia who has not been proud of this country, who has been confused about the country's identity and who has not felt a sense of pride when he sees the Australian flag flying&mdash;except Mr Keating. That is Mr Keating's great contribution to this country after 92 years of democracy and federation under a constitutional monarchy. We are, as I have said before in this chamber, arguably the world's oldest continuous democracy. We have come this far because of the inherent values of the Australian people which we have cultivated and nurtured; because of the institutions and systems of government which we have developed; the role played by our churches and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing is an attempt by the Labor Party to denigrate the past&mdash;those things that have gone before and created this country that we feel so proud of, the things that have enabled us to win the right to host the Olympic Games. In fact, the only person confused about the Australian flag at the IOC occasion, when we were given the Olympic Games, was apparently Mr Keating. The rest of the Australians there did not suffer Mr Keating's particular confusion, and indeed felt that great flush of pride which pulsed through the nation on hearing that Sydney had been chosen to hold the Olympic Games. </PARA>

It is a pity that this bill has been brought forward, and it is a pity for this reason: it is another divisive, nasty attempt by the nastiest, most divisive Prime Minister in Australian history to pitch Australians against Australians. When Mr Keating goes home to Ireland and he feels that flush of pride, he should understand that when Australians come home they, too, feel that flush of pride. They feel a great pride in their own history. The Labor Party spits on our history at its peril. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I thought the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill 1993 was being called into aid by the government in its campaign for a republic, I certainly would not vote for it, even at the second reading stage. I had intended to vote for this measure at its second reading stage. There is no-one in this chamber who would not agree with me that the Australian Citizenship Act needs amendment. Of course it needs amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was adverted to in the dissenting report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by Senator Vanstone, Senator Kemp and Senator O'Chee. They quoted Sir Ninian Stephen as saying that the act is an `abysmal document', that not only is it an extraordinary example of legal and bureaucratic language but that it is extraordinarily inappropriate for its title. The dissenting senators went on to say, `We believe it is inappropriate to make piecemeal amendments prior to such a full-scale review'. I am inclined to the view that the amendment being put is not piecemeal. There are certain features of this bill&mdash;leaving aside the pledge&mdash;which many people would not have any objection to and which would improve the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to the republican debate and I am concerned that there is now an attempt to call into aid certain questions, certain issues that should not be called into aid, namely, the amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act. There is also an attempt to call into aid religion to sustain a particular position on the republican issue. That would be the most inappropriate action for anyone to take because it only heightens and fosters what we least need in this community&mdash;sectarianism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to what Senator Cooney had to say.

Let the government tell the Senate whether it considers this measure being presented to us today as part and parcel of its moves towards a republic. I am prepared to debate that issue on its merits. Certain issues have not been adequately canvassed in that arena thus far.

I say that because I recall this debate last year and, quite frankly, it did not hit me as being part and parcel of a republican push.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to conclude this debate, let me at the outset reflect on some of the proposals put forward by Senator Spindler. It is the government's intention to agree with the amendment circulated by Senator Spindler to clause 3 of the bill; that is, that the third phrase in the preamble be amended to include the words `undertake to' before the words `accept these obligations', so that the full text of that phrase will now read, `persons granted Australian citizenship enjoy these rights and undertake to accept these obligations'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do so because we feel that the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats strengthens the commitment that one has to make to citizenship and to Australia as a nation. It does so by demanding an active act rather than the passive words that were in the text and that are in the text now. I indicate that we support those and, hopefully, those words will be passed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler also requested that the preamble should be read at citizenship ceremonies. I undertake to ensure that the act is implemented in such a way that the regulations pursuant to it provide for the preamble to be so read by ceremony administrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with the third proposal of Senator Spindler which is to adjust the citizenship certificate to include the words `and having undertaken to fulfil the responsibilities of a citizen'. I think they also are words that demand an act on the part of those who are being granted citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, and given that there does seem to be some degree of support in this place for the new oath of allegiance, let me say at the outset that the government sees that, with the passage of this legislation, this parliament will be doing a number of things. It will be reflecting the nature of our changed society. It will not be taking that act of republicanism that Senator Harradine was talking about. It is not a formal recognition of a republic Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look, little boy, just calm down. It does reflect the nature of the society that we now have in Australia. It is a changing society. It is a society which now consists of some 140 different ethnic communities. It has changed enormously and radically in the last 20 to 30 years. It is working extremely well, and it is working well because not only is the composition of that society so diverse, but also this parliament has a deliberate policy&mdash;and a bipartisan one at that&mdash;that has as its benchmark an inclusive approach to our society. It says to people of different religions and different ethnic backgrounds, `We respect your right to celebrate your religions and your diversity, and we will ensure that there are mechanisms in place to ensure that you can enjoy those rights, privileges and religions in a way that is tolerated, supported and recognised by the rest of society'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach we are taking is inclusive and to that extent we can be compared with many other parts of the world which take an approach to migrants coming to live in those countries which excludes them from full participation in the society in which they live. I have just spent some time in Europe and I have been able to witness the difference between this country and others when it comes to how migrants and people of different ethnic backgrounds are included in the life of the societies of such countries. I have seen the racial tensions that exist in other parts of the world. It is not very hard to analyse those tensions and those societies, and to appreciate that when you start excluding people&mdash;when you start oppressing them and repressing them when they want to enjoy and maintain the sorts of traditions that they have lived with for generations&mdash;you will get those sorts of racial tensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia have an inclusive approach and when it comes to an act like the citizenship act and the rights of citizenship we are once again inclusive. We do not, for instance, bar people from application forever, nor do we bar them from application to rights of citizenship for eight to 10 years as some countries do. We say to them, `Come to Australia, spend time here, prove yourselves as good citizens and after a short period of time you will be entitled to the rights of citizenship'. That is an important aspect in ensuring that people feel as if they are part of a society and have a commitment to the core values of the society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the other aspect of what makes our society so strong. Being part of Australia does not only mean that you can enjoy those traditions and religions and ethnic backgrounds, it also involves a commitment to a common core set of values and principles and institutions. We need such a commitment. We need to have that spelt out. The citizenship pledge, which we have had in legislation for decades&mdash;one that has had change in the past&mdash;needs to reflect those core values, those core principles of the institutions that we hold as fundamental to our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By putting up this particular piece of legislation the government is updating the legislation in such a way that it does reflect the bonds that are common to all Australians and that unite Australians.

Once again, they have been led from behind, led by the rural rump, led by those who really have not had a new idea&mdash;a new concept&mdash;for decades. What we have seen this afternoon, as we saw yesterday and as we will probably see tomorrow, is the opposition delving into the garbage bin of rhetoric.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have come in here this afternoon lost in those arguments and in the rhetoric, talking about antiquated values, but for most of the time, what have they done? They have abused the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). They have set out to abuse the Prime Minister personally and denigrate him, saying that he is lower than life and whatever. This is the same person about whom they were saying these same things this time last year and it is the same person who gave them a hiding at the election earlier this year. He gave them a bath because he tapped into what Australians are thinking and what direction Australia is now taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt&mdash;and I did not support the Prime Minister when he was making a run for the leadership&mdash;that he will be remembered as a pioneering Prime Minister, one of vision, one of guts and one who was prepared to make the changes to fit Australia in a way that would make it adequate and appropriate and fit to fight the battles of the end of this century and into the next century. He recognises both the economic imperatives and the social imperatives, and no degree of abuse from the other side will undermine that reputation which he will have into the future. No degree of abuse from the other side will detract from the fact that there is an irreversible tide in the electorate moving in the same way as the government is moving, in the same way as the Democrats are moving and in the same way as other forces in this place are moving, but which is not being responded to by the opposition. </PARA>

No-one from this side and no-one from the Democrats who has participated in the debate in this place or outside of it has said anything negative about our sovereign. She is the Queen of Australia and whilst she is that we will go through the processes and we will pay allegiance, as the Prime Minister did when he went to Yarralumla to be sworn in, as we all did, in conformity with the law in the country. Our obligation is to the law as it stands. But the reality is that there is an anachronistic situation in that we in Australia swear an allegiance to the head of state of another country. </PARA>

Senator Tate took a very deep interest in this proposal. We should recognise the work that he has done, and I gladly do so. I see the amendment that Senator Tate initiated on this oath as being very fundamental and one that has been able to be proceeded with without the need to address other aspects of the act.

I am looking at ways that the act can be reviewed and I expect that before Christmas I will be able to make some announcement as to how we can proceed on that broader issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the constitution sets out the core legal and constitutional institutions of this country, why is it that this particular pledge, which the government is putting forward in this bill, seeks to completely ignore one of those core institutions, which of course is the constitutional monarchy, as contained in the Australian constitution?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very obvious question and one that has been canvassed from time to time over recent months. The government's position has been that both in the preamble, where we talk about upholding and obeying the laws of Australia, and in the pledge where, once again, there is reference to upholding and obeying the laws, we anticipate, as part of the core values and core institutions of this country, that those values and laws will be adhered to, particularly the laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee asked whether the Queen is an institution within the Australian constitution. I think everyone acknowledges that the Queen has a very important part in the constitution. What we are talking about though is swearing allegiances to the democratic beliefs, rights, liberties and laws of the country. In terms of an oath of allegiance for citizenship one does not have to take the next step and swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. We obviously recognise that the Queen is part of our constitutional make-up, but what we are saying is that when one swears an oath of allegiance to obtain citizenship, one does not have to go through a specific act of swearing allegiance to the sovereign. </PARA>

He, like I, has probably noted that the vast majority of citizenship ceremonies are conducted by local authorities&mdash;a core institution in our society. Unfortunately, it is not a core institution that is recognised by our constitution, and that brings to the fore another anomaly in a constitution which is now close on 100 years old.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having heard Senator McKiernan's persuasive words, I am starting to think that this pledge is more and more defective every moment. Not only has the pledge left out the Queen, who is part of our constitution, part of a tripartite system of government, but Senator McKiernan tells us that this pledge has left out other key institutions of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is this: the minister gave us an explanation that we had to have a pledge that recognised the key institutions of this country, yet the minister's explanation for leaving out the Queen is that there is a reference to the laws of this land. The laws of this land are very important, but there is a hierarchy of norms in this country. The laws are part of a set of institutions, but we have to recognise that there is an institutional process for creating those laws. If we merely say that we are going to abide by the law, that is a fairly meaningless statement. If you do not abide by the law, you get put in gaol. It is so fundamental that I just cannot understand why the minister still chooses to leave out any reference to the constitutional monarchy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has told us that this has absolutely nothing to do with the republic. Why then does he oppose the reference to the Queen in this pledge if it has nothing to do with advancing the republican cause? I can see my friend Senator McKiernan over there straining like a greyhound in the slits looking forward to the passage of this bill. I know what Senator McKiernan's views are and I respect that they are different from mine. But the minister cannot escape the fact that this bill has an ulterior motive&mdash;and that is to advance the cause of the republican movement by weakening the adherence of Australian citizens and new Australian citizens to the institutions of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when we should be seeking more national unity to overcome the adversities which face our nation, it is particularly disappointing that this government seeks to bring into this parliament massive changes to citizenship in this nation through the change of the oath of allegiance. Yet this government will rely on a majority of but a handful to implement these changes. There is no way that an emotive change, a divisive change like this, can be passed with just a handful of votes.

I speak to the point that you raised, Mr Temporary Chairman, and that is with respect to the discussion that Senator O'Chee is getting into at the moment. He is drawing an enormously wide bow in seeking to bring in the history of white migration in this country on this particular point. This is the committee stage of this bill, and one does not want to open up a discussion about discriminatory policies or otherwise and going to the 1960s and to the changes that the Whitlam government introduced to bring in a non-discriminatory policy after 23 years or so of discriminatory Liberal Party policy and so on.

Of course, Senator Bolkus, in taking the point of order, has tried to introduce new matter. Mr Chairman, you will understand, of course, that under standing orders he is not entitled to do that. I did not object to him introducing new matter in the standing order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have said before and I say again that this legislation is defective, and I do not believe that the bill should stand as amended. I really feel that for this bill to stand as amended is as ludicrous as the spurious arguments we have heard that the Labor Party changed the White Australia policy. We know that is a nonsense, in the same way that the suggestion that this bill stand as amended is a nonsense. This bill is technically defective in failing to address the fact that we have a core institution in the constitutional monarchy which is not recognised. I know that brings a great deal of disappointment to the minister, but it is a fact. It is a fact that the wording of this bill has overlooked the wishes of a large number of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when we come to look at the question of whether this bill stand as amended, I say that this bill should not stand as amended. Although we have had amendments from Senator Spindler&mdash;and good amendments they were, and I support them; and Senator Spindler raised or foreshadowed similar amendments in discussions with us in the committee&mdash;I say that this bill still is not good enough. That is why I argue that this bill should not stand as amended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that this bill should not be accepted by the committee of the whole because of its manifest defects, its manifest omissions and because it seeks to divide one Australian from another. I know that may be perceived as a policy argument, but we now have a bill in a new form from the original form we had. I was hoping that we may have had some amendments that might have improved the bill and really taken into consideration what the minister said about recognising core values in this country, but we did not have those amendments. So I have a right and an obligation to stand before the committee of the whole and say that the bill should not be accepted; that the committee of the whole should not accept this bill because, in its current form, it still overlooks all those issues that I have raised during the course of my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it may pain the minister and some of his cohorts on the other side, but I would be failing in my duty if I did not point these things out.

The pledge says, `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share'.

Are we talking about the Australian government or some other institution, or are we talking about some laws that the people themselves may have thought up? If so, what are those and so on.

The current form of the pledge talks about allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister: has the government considered the legal implications of changing the form of words where `allegiance' applies to a person who symbolises and constitutionally epitomises the country to the words `loyalty to Australia'? What does the word `Australia' mean in the new pledge? That is what I would like to know. I am seeking this information generally. The minister might also advise the chamber as to whether, in the event that there is a republic and a president of the republic, it is the intention of the government to change this pledge to return it to `allegiance to' in reference to the president of the country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, we are trawling over old ground. On 23 June in this place Senator Tate answered much the same point that Senator Harradine raises. I do not think one can put it any better. I will quote what he said from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . `I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people'. This is the affirmative, positive act indicating a solemn commitment, an allegiance to Australia and its people. `Australia' is used there in a very simple expression but it has various levels of meaning. Obviously, there is the political entity, the Commonwealth of Australia. Loyalty is being expressed to that political entity, the name by which we are known amongst all the nations. But there is also a geographical and physical sense, which should not be totally discounted&mdash;the place. There is a commitment to Australia as the place where we are fortunate to be, the sunburnt country . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Tate goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the land abounding in nature's gifts of beauty rich and rare. In other words, we could have used the term `Commonwealth of Australia', but that would have been too restricting. `Australia' is just used in its simplicity with these various levels of meaning. So the loyalty commitment is meant to evoke obligations to Australian society, the political entity and the land itself, the place where we are.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that covers Senator Harradine's point. I think Senator Tate's comments also cover the point about precedents. It is a loyalty to the political entity, the land itself and the place where we are, and that encompasses the institutions of Australia in those senses. There is no intention to go on and do the things that Senator Harradine is worried about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a technical question for the minister. The wording of the pledge as it stands refers to Australia and its laws. As Senator Harradine has pointed out, that replaces an allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors. As Senator Harradine again quite rightly points out, allegiance in that sense requires obedience to the laws duly passed. The Queen is head of state not just of Australia but also of each of the individual states. So allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors requires obedience to the laws of the Commonwealth and each of the states. The wording which has been substituted in its place relates to the laws of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern&mdash;and I hope the minister can address it&mdash;is that this seems to leave out an obligation to obey the laws of each of the states, which are not mentioned in this provision. It would appear that the substituted wording does not catch the full meaning of the allegiance or obedience which is required in the existing oath of allegiance. I ask the minister whether this matter has been examined and on what basis is there an argument for saying that this proposed wording may include an obedience to the laws of each of the states, which are not expressly mentioned here and which are separate governmental systems?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If one looks at the relevant provisions of the previous affirmation or oath, one sees that there is a reference to bearing allegiance to Her Majesty, her heirs and successors according to law, and that is a distinct aspect of it. The previous oath or affirmation goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA>That reference to the laws of Australia obviously embraces the laws of the national government, the state governments and the institutions under the constitution. The words that are now being proposed are `loyalty to Australia whose laws I will uphold and obey'. Once again we have the political entity and land entity that Senator Tate talked about. The reference in the new pledge, as opposed to the previous provisions, is very similar. It refers to an obligation to faithfully observe the laws and uphold and obey the laws of Australia. There is no difference between now and previously. It is very clear that any legal reading of the current pledge or the previous provisions indicates a need to uphold and obey the laws of Australia on a national, state and territory basis. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pick up a couple of things that have been said since the second reading debate. In particular, I refer to a remark made by Senator Spindler in his contribution on the second reading of the bill. In support of the bill and the removal of the reference to the Queen in the oath or affirmation, he said&mdash;if I got him right&mdash;that we should be rejecting this symbolic relic of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza, who followed Senator Spindler, found that remark very highly offensive. I also find that remark very highly offensive. Like Senator Kemp, who also spoke in the second reading debate, I am insulted and very angry at the recent attempts by the government and some of its supporters or fellow travellers to rewrite the history of this country. That is what has been going on here for a lengthy period. This government has become a past master at attempting to rewrite history. It is attempting to rewrite immigration policy, our multicultural policy and a whole host of other policies that really go to the core of our history and the values that have built this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remark made by Senator Spindler, perhaps unconsciously, adds to that. But even worse, Senator Spindler is simply wrong. The symbols that we are referring to are not relics of the past. Even Senator Bolkus accepted in his remarks just a while ago that the Queen still is central to our constitutional system, which is the whole framework on which our society, government and parliament are based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The symbols referred to by Senator Spindler and by other speakers, particularly government speakers as a matter of denigration, are the present basic living symbols of our present basic living institutions. They are not just symbols; they are part of the essential working framework of this nation. Those symbols, those essential parts of our basic framework as a nation, do nothing at all to detract either from the multicultural nature of our society or the perception of our nation. On the contrary, what they do is enhance and enrich those great values, attitudes and attributes of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us in the Senate&mdash;I know the minister does&mdash;spend a great deal of time talking with a very wide range of people across the spectrum of Australia. I spend a great deal of time talking with the leaders and average members of the so-called ethnic communities of non-English speaking backgrounds in all states and regions of Australia. In my discussions with those people, I have never had any view at all expressed to me on any concerted basis on the question of the reference in the existing oath and affirmation to allegiance to our head of state, to our Crown, to the centrepiece of our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, to the extent that I have heard comments proffered to me, they tend to be the opposite; they tend to express a great pride in the act of citizenship&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;and what these people are swearing allegiance to. The government, without any grounds for doing so, is sweeping away very prematurely those living symbols; they are not in any way relics of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It distresses me very greatly&mdash;I will come back to this a little later in relation to Senator Harradine's request for an assurance from the minister about this&mdash;to see this bill being used in such a blatant way and as part of the push for a republic agenda. That is what all this is about. This is a deliberate, calculated attempt to hijack the republican debate and to pre-empt the outcome of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that desperate, headlong rush to achieve his personal ambition and agenda, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is running some very grave and dangerous risks that are causing great potential damage to this country. It distressed me greatly&mdash;I am sure it distressed every Australian greatly&mdash;to hear that, during the Prime Minister's recent visit to Ireland, he was reported as saying just a few days ago that he is a republican because he is a Catholic. I have seen no refutation of that comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the Prime Minister, in his personal push towards building an agenda for an Australian republic is resurrecting the ghost of sectarianism that blighted this country through much of our history and which, thank God, we got rid of decades ago. When the government starts to do those sorts of things, to use this chamber, this forum and this bill to achieve its agenda, it is about time we said, `Hey, hang on. Let's have a long, hard and careful look at this'. The whole approach to this is offensive to most Australians. It is disgusting, dangerous, divisive and, above all, un-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, Senator Bolkus, very rightly talked about tensions in other parts of the world. I could not agree with him more on that point. He is correct to compare our tolerant, inclusive, multicultural society with those tensions overseas and to draw attention to the fact that we have the great virtue of having escaped those tensions in Australia because we have done it right. We in this country must do everything that we can to preserve that tolerant, harmonious, enriched and diverse yet united society. It is our greatest gift and treasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this government doing? It is seeking, through this bill and in other ways, to divide the Australian people, not to bring them together. It is seeking to pursue policies which endanger our tolerant, generous and united nation. It is not only this bill that is doing it, although it is an important part of the agenda. Look at the government's handling of Mabo and all the legislation and debate surrounding that. Look at its handling of industrial relations issues and a myriad of other things. They all add up to a very long list of very divisive approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine, in his very wise comments, sought assurance from the government, through Senator Bolkus as the minister, that this bill be not part of a republican push. I may be wrong, but I do not think Senator Harradine received that assurance. But even if he had, what earthly weight could he place on it? There can be no doubt that it is an integral part of the Prime Minister's headlong personal rush down the republican road at any cost&mdash;regardless of the cost to social stability, social harmony and the basic tolerance of our great nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is not part of that agenda&mdash;I put this to Senator Harradine and other members of the Senate&mdash;why bring on this obviously contentious and very sensitive change at this time? There is no urgency for this bill and there is no urgency to change the oath or affirmation of allegiance. There is no pressure to do so from the ethnic communities or any other sections of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that we are now in the middle of an ongoing and emerging debate about the future constitutional arrangements for this nation, the obvious and proper course of action would have been to let that debate run its course, to await the outcome of that debate and to find out the wishes of the Australian people to see what the clear majority of the Australian people feel about it. If they want to change our constitutional arrangements, so be it; that is fine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Australian people need to decide that, not be pre-empted and hijacked in the process by a government which represents, at best, less than a majority of the Australian people. The obvious, proper and logical course would have been for this issue&mdash;the question of the oath of allegiance and, particularly, the deletion or continued inclusion of reference to the Queen as our head of state and the cornerstone of our constitution, which is the cornerstone of our nation&mdash;to be considered after we had concluded the debate and reached our views as a nation, a community and a people on whether we want constitutional change involving the Queen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are putting the cart before the horse in debating this matter in this way and with this timing. There can only be one logical reason for that, which is that it is part of the republican agenda. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) It is primarily the NSW Government's responsibility to ensure that management of forests, for which it has jurisdiction is consistent with the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS), to which NSW is a signatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 December 1992, I wrote to the Hon Gary West MP, the then NSW Minister for Forests, and the Hon Chris Hartcher MP, NSW Minister for the Environment, outlining the conservation initiatives of the NFPS. I specifically noted the commitment to avoid activities in areas likely to have a high conservation value, pending assessment of these areas for determination against agreed reserve selection criteria. I further advised that funding assistance for assessments of old growth forests and wilderness was available from the Commonwealth and requested advice on priorities for assessment in NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 31 May 1993, I wrote to the Hon George Souris MP, the NSW Minister for Land and Water Conservation, seeking support for old growth studies in NSW as a matter of priority.</PARA>

It is up to all signatories to honour the commitments they made when they signed the Statement. I believe that Compartments 1402 and 1312 are likely to have high conservation values. Therefore, not to avoid activities that may significantly affect those values is contrary to the policy intent of the NFPS.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Minister is aware of Mr Mollison's statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The figure of 93 per cent is not correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The "correct" figure depends on the definition of "cancer" used. There are at least 100 different forms of cancer in chickens. The most common form, seen in birds of less than 22 weeks of age, is Marek's disease. The more common cancer in older birds is called leucosis. There is an effective vaccine for Marek's disease and commercial layer flocks are vaccinated, and in addition are from leucosis free stock. The frequency of leucosis in layers is less than 1%. Backyard and free range chickens also suffer from these cancers, usually at a much higher rate than commercial layers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Most chicken meat in Australia comes from broilers slaughtered before 7 weeks of age. These birds have a low, even negligible cancer rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assessment of the potential health implications to consumers of the presence of cancer in battery hens shows that there is no association between the consumption of chickens in general and human health risk, and none between the consumption of battery hens with, or without, cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no risks because virus diseases of animals, including chicken cancers, are species specific. Very few virus diseases will cross species barriers, and then only between closely related species such as monkeys and man and sheep and cattle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The risk to consumers from eating chicken meat from battery hens is extremely low because, in addition to the species barrier, the meat is cooked before eating. Most bacteria and viruses are destroyed within a few minutes at 70(o)C. In addition the concentrated acid in the stomach and intestinal enzymes of the consumer will further degrade and inactivate viruses.</PARA>
