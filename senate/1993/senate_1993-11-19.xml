<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill encompasses amendments to eight acts:  the Defence Act 1903; the Industrial Relations Act 1988; the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973; the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991; the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973; the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, to which we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage; the Sex Discrimination Act 1988; and the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six of these acts relate to amendments that ought not to be before the parliament or taking up our time at present. These amendments arise from careless or faulty drafting instructions from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in relation to each of these bills. They do not relate, of course, to errors in the drafting itself; they are clearly errors in the instructions given by the minister in the first place. Correcting bills that were pushed through in such a hurry in the first place that they were not correct is the sort of thing that seems to take up a great deal of our time these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is to provide a legislative base to formalise partial cost recovery measures undertaken for some time by the Department of Industrial Relations and also to allow another government agency to make regulations&mdash;further eroding the powers of the parliament in favour of the bureaucracy, with the excuse that this is necessary to achieve national uniformity of occupational health and safety legislation. One might well ask: what has happened to states rights in this area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of this bill is stated to be an approximate $180,000 revenue gain from partial cost recovery of fees under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act. However, as the measures in the bill will only formalise practices which have been in operation within the Department of Industrial Relations for some time, the accuracy of the claim of $180,000 additional revenue is seriously doubted. I will be interested if the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner), when replying, could give us some explanation that is credible as to why that figure should be regarded as accurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this bill should be coming in at a time when we are extremely busy illustrates that the management of the program has generally been very poor, when we look at the things that are important&mdash;really important&mdash;to be dealt with before this year ends. It could have been done earlier in the program or it could be left until February of next year. We are not opposing the bill, but, as I mentioned, we will be moving an amendment to part 7. I wish to refer to some of the issues in the sections of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part 2, the bill makes gender neutral changes to the Defence Act 1903, and the chairman becomes a president. Part 3 amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to enable the Australian Industrial Registry to integrate with state industrial registries where agreement to do so is reached. The inference in the second reading speech is that the federal registry will be dominant. This is clearly expressed in the proposed section 63(1B)(a) which reads `acting as the registry for the State industrial body'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid duplication on a register, organisations with more than one branch on the same register will be able to amalgamate, provided their rules are the same or are made to be the same. In such cases it is feasible that one branch could be operating under a state award and the other under a federal award. The fact that the federal award will become the dominant award after amalgamation is not spelt out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might well ask: what is the hidden agenda in this amendment? Is it, in fact, another attempt to allow unions operating under state awards to transfer to federal awards? There is reason to think that this is the case. I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 18 November 1993 which begins by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least six big unions are pushing ahead with plans to shift thousands of WA workers from State to Federal awards in a bid to escape the State Government's new industrial relations laws.</PARA>
<PARA>We have good reason to think that this amendment is part of that process. The second reading speech refers to an agreement between the federal and South Australian governments in this direction. It is obvious that this agreement was entered into by the current South Australian government in the full knowledge that it will be surely defeated in the forthcoming election and that it wanted to lock the incoming government into an agreement which would not even be contemplated by the new Liberal government, in much the same way as the Keating government ratified the ILO Termination of Employment Convention of 1982 well after the March 1993 election had been called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 deals with the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 and performs what one might call a number of housekeeping tasks relating to maternity leave for staff of the parliamentary departments, and the powers of the Presiding Officers and senior officers of the five departments of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 relates to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991. It effects a number of changes to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act to effectively expand its scope to include the defence forces through an extremely broad definition of `premises', which will include any place, enclosed or built on or not, situated underground or under water; aircraft, vehicles or vessels; structures, either fixed or movable, whether on land, on the bed of or floating on any waters; or part of any premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a new definition and why it is necessary is not clear from the documentation put before us, especially as members of the defence forces already have access to very comprehensive free health services and special veterans' entitlements. The fact that they are to be included causes some concern, as does the hidden agenda. What an indictment it is of this government that, with just about every piece of legislation that comes into the parliament, we are entitled to look for the hidden agenda, because, more often than not, it turns out to be the case that there is one. Nothing is ever what it appears to be on the surface. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this amendment designed to treat the defence forces on the same basis as other employees in the public sector by firstly encompassing them in alternative arrangements and then later withdrawing their special superior benefits? Benefits, which, in my view, are well and truly deserved and totally appropriate to the armed services. I think we are entitled to ask for an explanation of what this really means and what the purpose of it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 23 of the principal act dealing with limits on the operations of the act requires Commonwealth departments, agencies and enterprises to be responsible for occupational health and safety of employees or contractors. This is to be expanded to include `other persons at or near a workplace'. This expanded clause causes some concern not only because of the vague nature of `or near', but also because public liability insurance cover costs may be forced through the roof as it encourages `other persons' not to exercise due care when entering onto or being near the defined premises, wherever that might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 33(b) of the bill will allow the National Occupational Health and Safety Council to determine codes of practice and to have those codes enshrined by regulation, subject to ministerial approval. Any regulation made under this provision will also apply to the same extent as I outlined when I talked about section 23 of the principal act; that is, to Commonwealth departments, agencies and enterprises, their employees or contractors, and other persons at or near a workplace. Again, the vague nature of this provision causes concern and I hope that the minister will more clearly define the extent to which the section applies when he replies to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 6 deals with the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and makes gender neutral changes to the act. The chairman becomes president. A new section is to be inserted to allow the Remuneration Tribunal to make discriminatory determinations on matters arising out of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 7 deals with the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. I will be circulating in the chamber a number of amendments to be moved by the opposition in the committee of the whole to clause 52. Part 7 corrects a number of drafting errors, and introduces a number of new sections dealing with recovery of overpayments to employees who retire at a time when they are in receipt of Comcare benefits. The proposed new sections would allow Comcare to recover overpayments from their client's superannuation fund without any reference to the client. It is an outrageous provision. Any senator who has had any constituents involved in dealings with Comcare and this area must oppose this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal provisions allowing any person or body access to any individual superannuation fund cannot be sanctioned by the coalition. We believe that people who accumulate savings to provide for themselves in their retirement should not have access to those funds prior to retirement unless very special circumstances exist. Certainly, a person or body should not be able to garnishee such funds without any reference to the person who would ultimately become the beneficiary of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments proposed by this bill would allow Comcare to tell superannuation fund managers that it is owed moneys because it has made overpayments&mdash;I stress that&mdash;to a particular person and that requires payment from the person's accumulated savings without any attempt to recover the overpayment from the client, and without any attempt to even ascertain whether it is reasonable to collect the overpayment from the client. It is the mistake of Comcare that we are talking about.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is adopting an easy option. It is adopting an unfair option. It is outrageous. It does not allow for disputes of quantum to be resolved before recovery is effected. It is contrary to normal business practice; it is contrary to natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To rectify this and to ensure that reasonable attempts are made to collect overpayments, and to allow quantum disputes to be resolved, on behalf of the coalition I shall be moving the amendments I have referred to, as has been suggested by Senator Watson, who, as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, has far more experience in this field than I have. I have certainly had considerable personal experience dealing with Comcare and I totally support the position that Senator Watson has put with regard to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 8 deals with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. It introduces a number of new sections authorising other changes made at part 6 of this bill relating to discrimination and remuneration matters, including who may lodge appeals and how they can be dealt with. The clauses in this part of the bill will also allow representative, or class actions, as they have commonly become known, to be dealt with by the Remuneration Tribunal in much the same manner as was provided for in the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech on the second reading debate of that bill on 8 December, Senator Hill expressed serious concerns about the direction in which the government was heading in that instance. Those same reservations are held about this bill, about the unnecessary duplication of avenues which already exist to resolve disputes. These sentiments in no way lessen the coalition's long-held commitment to equality of opportunity based on merit and equal reward for effort without discrimination on the grounds of gender, belief, association or race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last section, part 9, deals with the Tradesman's Rights Regulation Act 1946 and gives legislative authority to practices that have been used in the Department of Industrial Relations for some time without legislative authority to do so. These new clauses will allow regulations to be made prescribing collection fees to cover part costs incurred by the department in the administration of the act, including processing applications for trade certificates and arrangements for tests for a number of public and private bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the user pays principle and, on that basis, finds no objections to the proposals. However, the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum did not clearly spell out whether the $180,000 that is expected to be raised from this measure is additional revenue or expected revenue from longstanding procedures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Senator Reid has asked me to respond on a number of issues. Firstly, she asked why only amendments to section 23 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (Commonwealth Employment) Act have been proposed. Section 23 of the act authorises the making of health and safety regulations relating to employees or contractors. It does not allow regulations to be made in relation to third parties in the vicinity of a workplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 23 will be amended to allow regulations to be made to protect third parties in the vicinity of a workplace to which the act applies. This is consistent with the objects of the act and the employer's duty in section 17 to take all reasonably practicable steps to avoid jeopardising the health and safety of the general public at or near a workplace. The amendment also complements the amendments being made to section 70 by enabling the adoption of Worksafe standards in regulation form to the fullest extent possible and, as such, contributes towards the achievement of a national uniform system of occupational health and safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reid also suggested that the definition of the term `premises' is too broad and that there is some sort of hidden agenda to extend the coverage of the operation of the act. There is no attempt to see defence personnel covered by this section of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice received from the Attorney-General's Department has confirmed that, because no definition of the term `premises' is included in the act, the meaning of the term `workplace', and therefore the coverage of certain sections of the act, is ambiguous. Inserting a definition of the term `premises' makes it clear that a workplace to which the act applies includes field locations such as vehicles or mobile staff facilities. This removes doubt about the act's coverage and is done on the basis of advice from the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth ownership or occupation of premises remains necessary. Comcare Australia advised all state occupational health and safety authorities of the proposed amendment. No adverse comments have been received. Employers and unions have also indicated support for this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will try to paraphrase the issues Senator Reid raised. She asked why the Department of Industrial Relations introduced fees for functions that it carries out in relation to the act without the necessary legislative authority. Application and trade test fees were introduced in March 1989 with the approval of the then Minister for Industrial Relations as part of a move towards cost recovery for services provided by the department. This was consistent with government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for cost recovery was to provide additional resources to clear a significant backlog of applications for trade skill assessment without additional calls on the budget or a diversion of resources from other priorities. Included in that rationale was to fund continuous improvements in TRA operations to provide a quicker, better and more cost-effective service to clients, including the upgrading of staff profiles in all TRA state offices to provide a flexible approach to skill assessment, and the development and implementation of information technology databases to process and track client applications in a timely manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the department did not seek legal advice on the matter. The question of whether there was appropriate authority for charging fees was first raised by Department of Finance officers in the context of discussions about the department's section 35 agreement mechanism for revenue retention in July 1993. As a consequence, legal advice was sought from the Attorney-General's Department. Its advice was received in mid-August and stated that there was insufficient statutory authority for the collection of fees, and the collection of fees ceased immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her contribution, Senator Reid asked specifically about a quantum and may I say to her, finally, that $180,000 is an estimate of the revenue anticipated in 1993-94 under this amendment. I thank Senator Reid for her contribution to this debate. I indicate to her that the government will not agree to or accept the amendments that she has proposed. I ask the Senate to support this measure. </PARA>

As Senator Reid has indicated, the bill is a collation of amendments which have been generated from various sources, many from the Attorney-General's Department itself.

<PARA>The amendments are all to clause 52 and they should all be dealt with at once. It is all or nothing. There is no point in my putting them separately. I will speak to them as one proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand Senator Bell's concern about being in two or three places at once this morning and I share his criticism of the government's management of the program that it has been necessary to add this day as a Senate sitting day when there are so many committee matters to be dealt with. I know that Senator Bell is on a committee and he should be at it. I also recognise that, as a result of that, he would not have had the opportunity to hear my remarks when I spoke to this group of amendments in the second reading debate . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The amendments relate to the fact that Comcare will be able to take from a person's superannuation moneys which, in its opinion, may be owed to it by that person as a consequence of Comcare's own mistake in making an overpayment. There is no suggestion in this bill that it is because the employee of the Commonwealth has done anything to cause the overpayment or has done anything to mislead Comcare into having made an overpayment. It is because of a mistake within Comcare that it has overpaid somebody. Comcare will now, under this section, be given the right to rip into that person's superannuation fund and take it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question of going to a court to determine whether it is fair and just, no question of determining whether in fact there has been an overpayment&mdash;merely that Comcare determines that it made a mistake, it overpaid the employee, and it will get the money back no matter what, and from the superannuation fund of that person. There will be no question of writing to the person and saying, `We have bungled. We have made a mistake. We have overpaid you. We believe that morally you should refund to us a certain sum of money'. There will be none of that. It will just be taken out of the superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Senator Bell will consider the injustice of this. I am not suggesting for a minute that Comcare is not entitled to get the money back. It may be, but surely there must be some process whereby it is determined that it is entitled to get it back without this high-handed, absolutely unreasonable attitude of merely being able to say to the superannuation fund, `We want $49,000 for this fellow as over the past 20 years we have overpaid him'. All senators know what happens when someone turns 65. They drop out of Comcare. It is not as it used to be. They rely on their own superannuation. Bother me; it has already gone because they overpaid me during the previous 10 years!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody has thought through the actual implications to the former Commonwealth employee that we are talking about here when we allow, or even contemplate allowing a provision like this to be passed by the Senate. I hope that the Democrats and the Greens will give serious consideration to the absolute unfairness of this provision. There is no question of going to a court to determine whether or not the overpayment was a mistake, whether it was something that ought not to have occurred, whether Comcare ought to wear the consequences of its mistake&mdash;and there have been a number of cases that I have known over the years where there has been a mistake made but it is absolutely unfair to demand the money back and the minister has made a determination not to proceed with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here there is no question of that sort of thing. Comcare will go straight to the superannuation fund and rip the money out without even telling the person that an overpayment was made in the first place. It is incomprehensible to me that any minister in an Australian parliament would give instructions to his department and to the drafting authorities to pursue anything as unreasonable and as unfair as this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not believe that the minister would condone a provision of this kind and I would ask him to withdraw it. I certainly ask the Democrats and the Greens to vote down anything as outrageous as this. The government introduces these omnibus bills frequently. I ask it to withdraw this unfair provision and to come back with a provision which includes in it the right to tell the victim&mdash;the former Commonwealth employee&mdash;that Comcare has made a mistake and it wants some money back, to perhaps negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employee may be quite happy to pay the money back. He may have a little nest egg somewhere that he would prefer to pay it back from, rather than have his superannuation eroded in this fashion. The erosion of the superannuation in this fashion has extremely serious consequences, not only for him during the time that he is alive and receiving it. The minister will recall that, when he dies, his wife only gets a small proportion of that superannuation. That will have been eroded too. He may have a wife in employment who would agree to pay the money back for him to preserve the superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> How dare the government attack superannuation in this fashion and regard it as merely a sum of money to rip into when the government has made a mistake in this way! There will be no attempt to determine through normal judicial process that the money is properly owing, no attempt to negotiate a refund of the money which a person may agree to repay. I suggest that this provision be redrawn and redrafted to express the sort of things that I have suggested it ought to encompass and that we get an opportunity to deal with it again on some other occasion. I appeal to Senator Bell to take the view that there should be a little bit of fairness in the legislation that this chamber puts into practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I reject the characterisation of my participation in this debate in terms of a lack of attention or lack of detail. I did listen to Senator Reid's contribution at the second reading stage, even though the conditions that I complained of earlier did apply; in other words, I was required to be at a public hearing as well as here. I had considered the Industrial Relations and other Legislation Amendment Bill, its explanatory memorandum and its attachments&mdash;various as they are&mdash;before coming here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not share Senator Reid's interpretation of the bill although, at first glance, much of what is here appears overly strict. Proposed sections 114B(1) and (2) appear on page 15 of the bill. That whole section at the bottom of page 15 goes to the determination of whether an overpayment has been made. While we would be alarmed if the situation Senator Reid described were the case, it seems to me that a great deal of care is being required to be taken before this money is `ripped out', as Senator Reid said, of an employee's fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my reading of the bill, it is not Comcare that determines whether an overpayment has been made. As I read it, Comcare would form an opinion based on proposed section 114B(2)(b) which requires the administrator to tell Comcare or the authority whether the retired employee has received any payment, and which requires the administrator, if the retired employee has not received any such payment, to give Comcare or the authority, as soon as practicable, particulars of the rate of pension. It is not Comcare which marches out and gathers this information; rather it is the administrator. There are many more safeguards than one would think on the basis of Senator Reid's characterisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would perhaps have been persuaded by Senator Reid's concerns if we had had prior notification of her interpretation of the proposed section. As honourable senators would know, over the past two and a half years&mdash;that is almost as long as I have been here&mdash;I have been vigilant, both in the adjournment debate and at other times, in pursuing some of the bodies registered under Comcare in the occupational health and safety area. I have had a particular personal concern in pursuing any anomalies with regard to compensation payable to people under those provisions. Consistent with that attitude, I am able to lay claim to being genuinely interested in any anomalies that may disadvantage employees under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On my reading of the bill before these amendments were put to the chamber today, I did not share the interpretation given to it by Senator Reid.

What has been said this morning does not persuade. The amending legislation we have before us should improve the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of the remarks Senator Bell made about the provisions in proposed section 114B highlight the point I made. In fact, they support what I said in that the provisions he referred to about the administrator relate to the protection of the superannuation fund, not the person who is entitled to receive under it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a Commonwealth employee retires and notification is given to the superannuation authority, it may well be months before the superannuation is freed up and the employee receives any benefits under it. The employee could not even go to Social Security. As I see it, he would be left absolutely destitute from the time he retired from the Commonwealth, when his Comcare payments would cease, and the superannuation would be tied up. A reading of the proposed sections just referred to by Senator Bell actually confirms that that interpretation would be totally reasonable. Goodness knows what would happen to the person from the time the notice is given to the superannuation fund until it is finally resolved. Proposed section 114B(1)(c)&mdash;I do not see how one can explain away these words&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare or a licensed authority is of the opinion that it may pay, or may have paid,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>moneys&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in excess of the amount or amounts that he or she was entitled . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There can be no ambiguity about those words: `where Comcare is of the opinion that it may have paid moneys in excess of the entitlement to a retired employee'. I would say to Senator Bell that there is no ambiguity whatsoever about what those words mean. It is not an amount that has been determined. The same words are used in subsection (2) of proposed section 114B:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare or the authority, as the case may be, may give written notice to the administrator of the scheme:&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not to the employee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) stating that Comcare or the authority may make, or may have made, an overpayment of compensation to the retired employee;</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no protection whatever for the employee. There is no possibility of the employee having the opportunity to argue that, the payment having been made, he was entitled to keep it. It was nothing he could have known about. If one receives money that is known to be an overpayment or to have been a mistake, it can then be argued that the person making the payment is entitled to ask for it back and to take fairly direct steps to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has any comprehension about the way Comcare goes about making its determinations as to what will be paid would know that the injured Commonwealth employee has absolutely no capacity on earth to determine whether the amount he is receiving is the correct amount or not. He would have to be an Einstein even to get close to challenging it with Comcare and saying, `I should be entitled to 3c a week more than you are paying me'. There is no possibility that Commonwealth employees would have the capacity to work that out and be certain of it. If he is sent $349.87 a fortnight, he will accept that, bank it and use it, thinking it is the correct amount Comcare should be paying him. There is no reason for him to think that he should challenge that amount and wonder whether it includes an overpayment or rack his brains to work out whether it is correct or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comcare cannot always get it right. This provision would not be in here at all if Comcare never made a mistake. It does make mistakes, and they are probably honest mistakes. But the government cannot use this draconian means to recover the money from someone out of the superannuation fund when we know what impact that has on a person's future life. The government cannot put it forward in this fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no protection for the employee. The employee in this situation, having given loyal service to the Commonwealth and having been injured in the course of his employment, is now being treated in this fashion. I cannot believe that the minister seriously comes to the Senate with this proposition. Certainly it protects the administrator. From the proposed sections Senator Bell read out, the bill sets up certain relationships between Comcare and the administrator of the superannuation fund, but there is no protection for the former employee of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to withdraw this amendment. As I said earlier, it should have a look at this matter and give proper drafting instructions so that it achieves what it really means. If somebody wilfully refuses to repay something that it has been established is properly owing, Comcare may well go to the superannuation fund to get it, but at least it should do a little of what I have described first.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments that have been moved by Senator Reid are not necessary. There is more than adequate provision to protect those who have received an overpayment. Senator Reid asked, and I think it is a reasonable question, whether these proposed amendments will cause hardship to retired employees. The answer to her question is no, they will not. In fact, the current arrangements that require the employee to repay overpayments directly are more likely to cause hardship than the proposed arrangements, particularly if the amount of overpayment is large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current regime is inconvenient and stressful for the retired employee and it is also costly to administer. It may result in recovery proceedings being commenced and may also reduce the retired employee's income over a considerable period if he or she is required to repay the amount in instalments. The proposed regime has several important safeguards designed to protect the regular income of the retired employee and prevent any hardship or inequity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The retired employee will continue to receive a steady income, and that is achieved in two ways. The scheme will operate only if the retired employee has not received any superannuation. Further, Comcare and licensed authorities are required to continue paying full compensation until the relevant superannuation fund administrator has been informed of the exact amount of the overpayment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When compensation payments are reduced, the relevant administrator will be in a position to commence superannuation payments, thus ensuring a regular income for the retired employee. There may be a short period&mdash;I do not envisage it being any more than two, three or four weeks&mdash;when the retired employee may not receive the full amount of superannuation if the arrears of superannuation are insufficient to cover in full the overpaid compensation. During that period, the balance of overpayment will be deducted from superannuation payments until the overpayment has been repaid in full. It is also important to point out that a determination as to the amount of compensation that has been overpaid and is to be recovered from a superannuation fund administrator is reviewable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of preconditions for the operation of the scheme for the recovery of overpayments, which will need to be met before the new mechanism will operate. The retiring employee must be in receipt of compensation, under proposed section 114B(1)(a) and (c). Under proposed section 114B(1)(b), he or she must be entitled to a superannuation benefit and must elect to receive payment of a benefit, whether it be a lump sum or a pension or a combination of both. The mechanism will not operate if the employee elects to preserve his or her benefit. The employee must not have received any superannuation payment, under proposed section 114B(4). This safeguards the retiree's income stream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under proposed section 114, if payments have commenced Comcare or a licensed authority must recover overpayment from the employee in the existing manner. This will avoid the possibility that, where payments have been made for a significant length of time, the employee may be forced to go without a superannuation income for some time if the overpayment is recovered from the superannuation fund administrator. As I said before, the amendments Senator Reid has moved, I believe in good faith, are not necessary because  adequate provisions exist within this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remarks made by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) confirm the necessity for these amendments in order to protect people. I do not think the minister understands the impact on future payments once the superannuation capital sum has been attacked in this fashion. If we allowed for the superannuation to be paid and the person to make fortnightly repayments, that would make a lesser impact on the person's entitlements and receipts than doing it in this fashion. I do not believe that the minister is saying that we can take this capital sum out of the superannuation and yet pay to the person the fortnightly payments he would have received had that not occurred.

Can the minister give an unequivocal guarantee that, if that person has turned 65, Comcare will still pay that amount of money to him for as long as it takes to sort out what has to be repaid? I do not believe that that is the case. I would be very interested to have an unequivocal assurance that the moneys will be paid after the person turns 65 while these difficulties are resolved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not quite understand what that means, because there is some real significance about turning 65. Comcare normally does not pay people any more because they move into their retirement income phase. This has caused a lot of hardship and heartache to a lot of people. A person would be expecting his superannuation to provide him with certain fortnightly repayments which he would have budgeted to live on after he had reached the age of 65 and retired. He is in the uncertain situation then of not knowing how much of the capital is going to be taken and what impact that will have on the amount of fortnightly payment he will subsequently receive. This is of real significance to people at 65. If we are talking about someone aged 55, Comcare may very generously continue to go on making the payments the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) referred to, but it is at the age of 65 that I have some real concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>

My understanding is that, up to the present, the members of the ADF have been excluded from the application of the occupational health and safety act in a rigid way. Over the past 10, 15 or 20 years, the Department of Defence has moved very considerably to make sure that there are no&mdash;for want of a better word&mdash;bad habits, circumstances or anything that is deleterious to health within the practices or the duties it requires from members of the Australian Defence Force. In relation to explosives, gases and things like that, quite a high level of attention has been paid to minimising any risks to members of the Defence Force. But there are other provisions of the occupational health and safety act, such as the limitation to some absurdly low weight that one person can lift and all the other things, that clearly were inspired to aid the unions in their featherbedding and which have never been applied to the Defence Force, nor could they ever be applied. I wonder whether the minister could make some comment on the applicability of part 5 in this bill to members of the Australian Defence Force in the pursuance of their duties. </PARA>

I ask this because, with regard to the licensed authorities&mdash;I sought to clarify to whom this applied&mdash;in the operation of workers compensation payments and the administration of that whole scheme, the Democrats have been vigilant over a couple of years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the coalition, I indicate that we propose to vote against the clause. This clause seeks to penalise Western Australia for introducing voluntary student unionism. That legislation is currently going through the state house in Western Australia. This clause will take from the grant allocated to that state the moneys the student unions will lose as a result of voluntary student unionism . For example, if the figure was $5 million, the funding to the state for higher education would be reduced by that amount. The money would then be given by the Commonwealth to those student unions, which I believe are referred to here as higher education institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply bring to the attention of the Senate, and particularly the Democrats and Senator Bell, that the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights states in article 20 that everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and I highlight the word `association'. The tenet of the state legislation in Western Australia is that students should have the choice of whether to belong to their student union or not; it should not be compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the union fee is paid in an amenities fee. Ever since I have been associated with this cause, there has been a great deal of feeling among students that they should have the choice of whether to pay this money or not. It goes automatically to their guild and, in turn, the guild provides services which students may or may not use. There may be students who wish not to use the services of the guild and therefore would not contribute any fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps a worthwhile to ask: if the guild provided services that were so good and beneficial, what would they have to fear from voluntary student unionism? Everyone would be willing to pay the guild fee; everyone would want to enjoy the services. But that is not the way it is. A lot of students are not happy with their guilds and the uses to which the guilds put their fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central element of the coalition's education policy platform, which was well publicised and released prior to the elections, both federal and state, was that legislation would be brought in to end compulsory guild membership. The government in Western Australia was elected on that platform. The people of Western Australia elected a Liberal government which had as part of its platform legislation to end compulsory guild membership. Here we have the federal government trying to interfere with a state government carrying out a promise on which it was elected. The Commonwealth is blatantly interfering with the state government. The Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, said in the second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian state parliament recently legislated to interfere with the rights of institutions in that state to make their own decisions about imposing or collecting these fees.</PARA>
<PARA>The institutions do not have any rights; it is the members of the institutions who have the rights. That is where the government has it wrong. The government, in its collective approach to this, would like to give institutions all the rights in the world. Institutions should be about the last things in the world to get rights. It is the members, the little people, whom the government is supposed to represent, and these are the students. The students do not have the funds available. Most of them are not well endowed with funds to pay guild fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an extract from a campaign broadsheet produced by the Cross Campus Guild Network headed `Minister set to silence students', circulated in August-September this year. It says that, should this measure be passed, the guild would still end up with the same amount of money because it would be funded by the federal government. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would be a terrible outcome. Yes, the Guild would survive pretty much as it has done before, but its legitimacy would be crushed by the sudden huge drop in membership, and the loss of access to the governing bodies of the Universities.</PARA>
<PARA>It is saying that the guild would then be a government funded body; it would lose its legitimacy; it would not be there as a result of voluntary support of the students. It would be an empty shell because most students would not belong to the guild. The guild would just be an empty shell funded by the government. It would be a toothless tiger. It would be something it was never meant to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a past guild councillor of the University of Western Australia, as Senator Chris Evans might well remember, and past chairman of the public affairs council. I can say that student guilds can do a lot of good things, I do not dispute that, but they become multimillion dollar businesses which in some cases overlook the concerns of the average student and sometimes direct their funds to political purposes which the students do not endorse. For example, in my day the guild of undergraduates gave money to the Frelimo group in Mozambique. </PARA>

A minority decided that; it was a case of the tail wagging the dog. Let us make these institutions voluntary. They can then rest on their laurels or otherwise and, depending on how good they are, their membership will tell the story.

In fact, there is no possibility of seeing a student organisation that provides services on campus as fulfilling that definition of a trade union. It is unfortunate&mdash;and I am personally concerned&mdash;that many of the student organisations have the title `union'. They do not serve the purpose of a trade union.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly am not confused; what I am concerned about is the confusion that is brought to this debate by the coalition's use of the term `voluntary student unionism'. The student organisations that provide services and amenities on university campuses serve a purpose that is very similar to the purpose served by local government authorities. I would have thought the parallel would be easily identified by even the slowest thinkers on the coalition benches.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who live in the community and are supported by the amenities provided by local government authorities do not have any trouble whatsoever in agreeing to the concept of rates and taxes being applied by their service organisations&mdash;the local government authorities&mdash;for the people who live in that community; nor do those people have any great difficulty in understanding that to be part of that community one may or may not use to the fullest extent all of those services and facilities that the local government authority provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some campuses are much larger than a lot of the local government authorities we are talking about. A Melbourne or Sydney metropolitan university campus is considerably larger than most of the local government authorities in Tasmania. As Senator Ellison quite rightly said, they provide a multimillion dollar level of service, which has in some cases, by tradition, grown to the extent that it would be very difficult to assemble an organisation to supplant it and provide a similar service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition likes to characterise student organisations as unions because of the implication that such bodies are captives of the Australian Labor Party. There is nothing further from the truth. Over recent years the Australian Democrats have been received in a climate of great welcome by student organisations, which are only too keen to criticise the education policies of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, some of the most significant opposition to the education policy of this Labor government has come from and been initiated by student organisations, which do not in any way see themselves as kowtowing to the desires of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people on campus who wish to endorse the policies of the government or the coalition are free to join one of the political associations. The number of members of Australian Democrats bodies on student campuses is growing like wildfire&mdash;so senators had better watch out. Those people have recognised the fallacy of the arguments that have been put by the coalition and the inadequacy of the treatment that has been given to them by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point to be made here is that the freedom of association that was spoken of by Senator Ellison has been well met by the opportunity to join political groups. I share Senator Ellison's concern that some student bodies have in the past taken it upon themselves to enter into political debate to such an extent that donations have been made to political organisations. I share his abhorrence of that. If I were a member of an organisation or a student at a campus that was so affected, I would be railing against that to ensure that the perpetrators of such a donation were voted out of office at the next opportunity. That is abhorrent to me, and I will say that in any forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation is not unlike the expenditures made by local government bodies, some of which have been condemned and ridiculed in the past. I dare say there are examples of inappropriate donations by local government bodies to all sorts of nefarious things. There have been some donations made by this very government&mdash;and not only to political organisations&mdash;which have been criticised. Senator Calvert has done an incredible job of ferreting out which are appropriate and which are not. At this very moment we have before us criticism of donations and moneys made available to organisations that we, who are not the government, would like to criticise&mdash;and are criticising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not get carried away with the idea that all organisations and bodies are beyond criticism in that sort of application of their funds; I would criticise any organisation. There are many organisations that take the money from their membership and do inappropriate things with it. That has nothing to do with the nature of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These organisations we are talking about cannot be accurately described in the same breath and with the same association as unions in the sense of trade unions. Senator Ellison gave us the very reason why we could understand that&mdash;he was a member of one. I presume that he, as a member of one&mdash;I may be wrong, but I will presume; when I was a member of one, it applied to me&mdash;did not think as a member of the Labor Party, act as a member of the Labor Party, or believe that he was a member of the Labor Party. I would have thought that it would be fairly apparent from that definition and that experience that, although student organisations sometimes use `union' in their title&mdash;or `guild' or `association'&mdash;they are vastly different from the organisations that are called trade unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp interjects, `Why not voluntary?'. The answer has been provided several times during my speech. The argument is tired. It has been applied; it has been run. The answer is quite simply&mdash;I repeat what I said before&mdash;that these student organisations are servicing a community; that is, the community of campus. It is a campus which has services provided to it by that student organisation. It is entirely parallel to the community we find serviced by a local government. There is no opportunity for a person living in the city of Canberra to say, `I don't really live here. I won't really belong here'. There is no opportunity for a person living in the community of Wagga Wagga, Bourke or wherever to say, `I don't belong to the organisation of this community. I will not walk along the footpaths, use the roads or use the amenities'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the communities on campus are entirely parallel in that way, I would have thought that that could have been apparent to the people who express such strong opinions here. If I thought for one moment that student organisations were, in fact, unions in the sense of being trade unions and that people were compelled to join them, I would easily join the thoughts of the coalition and oppose such compulsion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is the opportunity to conscientiously object to being asked to associate oneself with this group of people and withdraw from membership of same, and thereby be subjected to payment of the service fees but not have one's named added to the membership lists. That opportunity may not be readily taken by people who do not understand what it is they are being required to pay. I think a proper assessment of this situation would really give the lie to the expression `voluntary student unionism' which has been responsible for so much of the confusion that we find ourselves in at the moment. </PARA>

We will forgive him that fundamental problem of the philosophy of the Democrats and his own personal philosophy, that he would ensure that young Australian citizens would not have the freedom to make decisions, using their own free will and their own judgment, as to whether or not they want to be in an association.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have a debate about the philosophy of whether young Australians should have the freedom of choice to join a union, or the freedom to assemble, or the freedom to speak.

So we know where he is coming from, but let us not debate that.

We in the opposition say no, they should not. We think that if a state government decides to have compulsory unionism then it should not be bribed not to. Equally so, if a state government decides to have voluntary unionism, it should not be bribed not to. That is our position. We make no ideological judgment. We would prefer to see voluntary student unionism on campuses because we believe in fundamental rights of individual Australians to make those sorts of choices.

They are potentially ripping off Western Australian taxpayers to the tune of up to $5 million by refusing to support our amendment. We have had this week in the national capital a furore over the funding of the sports grants and the political pork-barrelling meted out by these corrupt sporting grants through Minister Kelly's office. An amount of $3.9 million went to Western Australia: $600,000 went into the seat of Swan; $500,000 went into the seat of Canning; and equal amounts went into the electorates of Brand and Perth. The four most marginal Labor seats in Western Australia, together with Cowan, received in excess of $2 million in pork-barrelling grants to try to ensure that Mr Beazley and Mr Gear in particular were returned to this place. I am focusing on the amount of money that is involved. </PARA>

Both those gentlemen, who were returned to this place by between 100 and 200 votes, owe their political life to the blatant and corrupt political pork-barrelling that was meted out through the minister's office. It was a disgrace. We are talking of a total of about $2.1 million to $3 million in global terms in Western Australia in the last financial year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If when the guilds in the University of Western Australia, Murdoch University and other campuses become voluntary they behave in the most obnoxious, nasty manner by not servicing their students and basically running down the unions, they will have very low memberships because no-one will want to be a member of them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If all those unions were atrocious and no-one joined them, they might still elect one of Senator Chris Evans's or Senator McMullan's mates as their president and have an executive and so on, but they may not have any members.

As I said in my contribution to the second reading debate last night, I hope there is an incentive in the system for the unions to be run well, to make decisions in the interests of the students, to provide services that students want to use, and to provide inducements to join unions and to get involved in them, such as discounts at bookshops and coffee shops. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not have thought that it was the major issue. I am prepared to concede that issues such as WA Inc. and the royal commission were a bit more in people's minds than the question of student politics and guilds. I think the attitude of the Greens and whether or not they should be adopting state government policy was also a rather strange diversion. I think Senator McMullan made the appropriate point, that it suits senators opposite to support the state government. Recently, when there was a Labor state government, it was a less telling argument. I think we all have to accept the fact that senators come to this place with their own views, their own ideologies and their own platforms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Bell has sufficiently canvassed the question of the voluntary student union debate and I do not wish to go over that ground again. It was a debate that people like Senator Ellison were involved in in the 1970s. It was fought and lost by the Liberal Party in the 1970s and it is a bit unfortunate that we are still having this debate some 20 years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally stayed out of student politics when I was at university. I actually did most of my degree part-time while working and did not find the time for student politics, although I was active in Labor Party politics at the time. While I do not wish to ruin senator Ellison's political career, I actually voted for him on one occasion. I do not know whether that will ruin his career or my career. He was a very effective student politician at the same campus that I went to. I think I voted for him more for his support of the social aspect of student politics than the ideological perspective he brought to the debates. It was a very important part of the student life on campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address some remarks to the question of international obligations, which have been referred to in support of the Western Australian position. I was quite surprised by the remarks of Mr Norman Moore, the state education minister. He referred to international obligations as the basis for his state legislation. Given the well-known views of Senator Kemp and Senator Ellison on the question of UN declarations, their concerns about Geneva based bureaucrats, international bureaucracies and foreign committees, the general xenophobia that they show in relation to anything that arrives from an international body and their concern about Australia's sovereignty, I am very surprised to find that suddenly they are using this argument in support of their position. In fact, I think Ellison referred to it in his contribution today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think it is important, because they have raised the issue, that it be dealt with. I think it is important that it be put on the record that the European Court of Justice has held that universal membership of student organisations does not contravene internationally accepted principles; therefore the argument that the Liberal Party is using on this occasion does not hold water. Also in support of that proposition, I would like to refer senators to a legal opinion provided by Mr Ron Castan QC&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . recourse to these international instruments as justification for criticism of the current regulatory framework of Student Guilds in Western Australia is misconceived.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Castan thought it significant that students on tertiary campuses in Western Australia have the option of conscientiously objecting to becoming members of the student guild. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that under the existing system students who conscientiously object to paying the Student Guild fee nonetheless remain entitled to the benefits of membership of the Guild, it may reasonably be argued that offering the option of conscientious objection is sufficient compliance with the UDHR.</PARA>
<PARA>So I think that this sudden interest and support for international covenants by members of the Liberal Party is in fact misplaced. Those covenants do not support  their arguments on this occasion. They have led no evidence in support of the assertion that they gain any support from those instruments. As I say, it is quite bizarre, given the attitude of senators opposite when we debated things like the UN declaration on religious beliefs and the UN declaration on children, that they now turn to those international organisations for support. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really want to go through the whole debate about student unionism. I think it was well canvassed in Australian society in the 1970s. I think it is a shame that the student warriors who are now members of parliament have not been able to give up their ideological obsession with this issue. I understand that Mr Moore was also a well-known student politician on a tertiary campus in Western Australia. I think they are trying to fight the fights of the old days that were lost and have another go at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I know that Senator Campbell has an ideological and deep personal commitment to what he sees as a question of voluntary membership, I think he is also coloured in his views, as he indicated in a couple of the speeches he has made, about the question of the NUS supported candidate in the federal seat of Swan at the last election. Senator Campbell, like many Liberals, has been unable to accept the result of the election and the fact that Mr Beazley was returned in the seat of Swan, and Mr Gear in the seat of Canning. His contribution today again highlighted the concern that nags away at him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Labor Party won the federal seat of Swan in a close fought election. It was a seat that the Liberal Party expected to win; it did not. It is a very good result for the Australian parliament, as well as the Labor Party, that Mr Beazley was returned. I really do think it is time to move on. Senator Campbell has dealt with the arguments about voluntary student unionism. They really are not relevant. They do reflect an ideological obsession on behalf of the Liberal Party and some of its former student politicians. I think we ought to support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about a part of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill which requires the Commonwealth to deduct a payment to the states for tertiary education if there is voluntary unionism. It is all very well for Senator Chris Evans, who really added nothing to the debate at all, to claim that that debate was held in the past. The point I make to Senator Evans is that gross injustices still exist, and they demand some sort of remedial treatment in the form of making a student's decision to join a union an act of choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an extraordinary speech from Senator Bell who, no doubt, tried hard to put something together, but it had no direction or discipline at all. He also failed to realise the great injustice that is being imposed on the student body. Not only are students compelled to be part of a union&mdash;and that is the end of the matter&mdash;they are also compelled to pay a very large sum of money relative to their income or their assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My four children are graduates of the University of Queensland&mdash;one of the largest universities in this country. I objected to paying $600 or $800 or more a year for my children, when entitled to free education, to be part of what was clearly a nefarious organisation, as the student body at the University of Queensland was at the time. I took that up with the registrar. I rang him and said, `I object to paying student union fees on a compulsory basis for my children'. I was told in very gruff terms, `Like it or lump it. If you do not pay it, not only will your children not be allowed to enrol at the university, but they will not be allowed to sit for examinations. If they can get into the examinations on some basis, they certainly will not have their papers marked'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not accommodated at all by the university administration. I did not push ahead with the matter because I have a very strong view, which I have always followed, that I am in public life and my wife and children are not. I certainly will not make them in any way captives of my political beliefs, and I certainly do not expect any member of my family to fight the political battles that I feel strongly about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a gross injustice that students are forced to be members of unions. There is every case to be made for a voluntary union system. When I was an undergraduate I paid something like #5 to be a member of the student union and a member of the sports union. It is a very different situation today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say, as Senator Bell does, that facilities provided by the student unions are somehow a life support system that cannot be provided in any way by any other body and to compare them with local governments is so fatuous that I wonder whether he has ever been on a campus, or whether he has been at some second-rate TAFE in the backblocks of Tasmania. Anything that the student union does can be provided by private industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do students want? The university buildings are provided by the government&mdash;or by the university itself, in the case of Bond University. The university is required to provide the roads, the lecturers, the lecture rooms, the hardware and the libraries. Basically, all one gets out of the student union is the opportunity to buy food&mdash;food which is often inedible and certainly not life promoting in any way. Food can be provided by anyone running a refectory. It can be provided by a formation from a group of students. But most of the students who are interested in student union affairs are interested in politics, not in commerce. There are absolutely no facilities that the student union claims to provide that cannot be provided by private industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this were just a small matter of a few people saying, `You have to join a union and pay a couple of hundred bucks a year', that would be fine. But one has to look at the overall picture. The student unions on the big campuses have grown out of all perspective. They are giant organisations. As Senator Ellison said, they have budgets running into millions, and there is a lot of abuse. There is even criminal abuse at times in the administration of those funds. There is also an abuse, in a perverse sense, in so far as those funds are used to promote whatever political causes the executive group of the union holds at the time. They do that free from any censure by or consultation with the student body. The executives of student unions are absolutely uncontrollable by the great mass of the students that they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The student unions now provide career opportunities. I was astonished to find some years ago that union presidents are now full-time paid employees. I believe that Mr Beazley was the first one in the guild in Western Australia to become a full-time paid president. I cannot understand how the needs of a student body demand a full-time paid president. If a student&mdash;an undergraduate or a graduate doing a higher degree&mdash;could not look after the affairs of that union movement, then there is something wrong. I say that as someone who has taught in universities in three different countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time we often see a gross abuse of power in Australian student unions. They pursue issues that do not promote the welfare of the student body at all. Their efforts ought to be directed at improving the lot of students on the campuses, but instead they pursue issues&mdash;often to the detriment of the student body and sometimes to society&mdash;in which they simply should not be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that the ALP likes the student unions. It is not true to say, as Senator Bell said, that everyone in a student union is a Labor member. The point is, as I said before, that the ordinary student cannot influence the executive. The ALP likes the student unions because it has a rent-a-crowd which it can turn out on any controversial issue at any time. It can guarantee to turn it out and get good television footage at the time of an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so far as these bodies are now uncontrollable and are not contributing to the welfare of the student movement, it should be a fundamental exercise of a student's basic rights to say whether he or she wishes to join a student union. If that happened, there would be a big change in the way the student unions performed: give some power back to the student body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the good things about the introduction of HECS and some sort of fee system for students is that some power is given back to members of the student body. They can demand that inadequate lecturers perform and that bad administration of the university is dealt with, because they are making some contribution to their education through the payment of these fees. By the same token, if students can have a voluntary association with the student unions, there will be an improvement in the quality of administration and in the quality of service that those unions can provide. I support the opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to Senator Campbell and other members of the coalition that the debate today is really about the right of the Commonwealth to replace the loss of revenue which is essential for the provision of services to students in Western Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause allows the government to recover funds from the states if those states have interfered with the autonomy of an institution&mdash;in this case it is a students' institution.

In the two universities which I have been involved in in the last 5 1/2 years those fees provided a welfare officer. Mr Moore's very capable researcher Marc Dale, who was a student of the QUT, was the welfare officer at QUT for some years while I was there. He was one of the best welfare officers we ever had.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is. He told me that on the many occasions he has rung me in the last few weeks. He is a very committed student and a very good friend of mine. However, I was not convinced by his arguments. The services which are provided by student guilds include such things as welfare officers, child care facilities, education officers, sporting facilities, and so on. If Senator Panizza really understood what Senator Bell was saying he would have realised that these facilities are also provided by many local governments. That is where the comparison is made. I do not think Senator Panizza understood what Senator Bell was saying at that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are arguing about the ability of students not only to be provided with these services but also to have some way of controlling and influencing the direction that these services take and which services should be provided. When I was involved in this debate some years ago I did some research. I talked to various vice chancellors and it was pointed out to me that if students do not pay these fees through their guild they will have to pay the fees in some other way because the services are essential in the mind of the universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The membership of the guild is not compulsory; it is the payment of the fee that is. If the fee is not paid through the guild it will be paid to the university in some other way. The membership of the guild provides the students with some control over the way in which their fees are spent. That is the essential thing that membership of the student guild provides. The fee for these services will be paid either through the guild or through the university in some other way. That is where the compulsion comes in. The membership of a guild enables the students to have some control. In other words, it enshrines that principle of individualism which is so important to the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could have made a stronger argument than Senator Ellison did about the politicisation of guilds. This politicisation has come about not only through the interference of the Labor Party but also through the interference of the coalition in student politics. This is certainly the case in the two universities with which I have been involved&mdash;the University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would abhor that politicisation whether it came from the Labor Party or the coalition. I believe that is the one thing that cuts across the argument I am making about the fact that student guilds are there to provide representation and control over the services which are provided. I hear the argument Senator Ellison is making and I sympathise with it. The Democrats support what the Commonwealth is doing because it enables students to have representation and to have some control over the services which are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we have within universities at the moment is the apathy of students. Again I hear what the opposition is saying in that respect. I will give the Senate an illustration. In 1991&mdash;a year in which I took quite a deal of interest in the elections at the Queensland University&mdash;only 4,000 out of 20,000 students voted in the election for the student guild. That was the highest vote they ever had. At QUT in another year, 800 out of 20,000 students voted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is not whether students have to pay a fee: the problem really is that if students are not happy with the actions of their guilds they should exercise their democratic prerogative. Where democracy is falling down is not whether the payment of fees to student unions or student guilds are voluntary but where students are not voting and taking their places in the activities of the particular associations to which they belong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to support the continuation of these services and the continued funding of these services. The coalition needs to activate its own student movement, get it working and make sure that those students who support its particular opinions are able to make their presence felt within the student unions and student guilds to which they belong. They need to have a say in the way in which these services are provided because they are essential and must be funded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a few brief remarks on this contentious issue. I was interested in the comments made by Senator Woodley. He said, probably with some reason, that he deplores the politicisation which occurs in student unions or, as Senator Bell would have it, student local governments. But, nonetheless, I think that is a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley drew this concern to the attention of the Senate in a quite proper way. Then surprisingly he concluded by saying that the way to deal with this problem is for more students, and particularly those from the conservative side of politics, to get more involved in these student activities. In other words, this would further politicise these unions and guilds. The solution that Senator Woodley presented to the chamber would compound the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also an assumption&mdash;and I think that this is important&mdash;that these services would not be provided if they were voluntary. When we think about that, we are saying that these services are absolutely vital to the students but that, if the students wanted to pay for them, they would not be. I really do not think Senator Woodley is able to have it both ways. If he rests his case by saying that these things must be provided, they will be provided and they can only be provided in a compulsory fashion. Implicit in that argument is the possibility that students do not want the comprehensive range of services which are on offer. I do not know the answer to that question. One of the advantages of bringing in a more sensitive response to market forces is to test what is absolutely vital to the students and what is not. There is a problem of logic there, and I do not think that has been addressed by any of the supporters of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw Senator Bell's remarks to the attention of the Senate. I thought he tried to use some language to get around the fact that these student unions were not unions in the industrial sense. Whereas one can point to activities which are not typical of trade unions, nonetheless, as the saying goes, if it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, there is a presumption in law that it probably is a duck. I do not think we should get buried in semantics, but most of these bodies call themselves unions and we should basically accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, `union' is not the key word. The key word is `voluntary'. I would have thought that all Australians would have found this word very congenial. They have the choice as to whether or not they join this union. If Senator Bell asked the Australian public whether they believe in compulsory trade unionism, they would say that they do not. They want to have a choice of whether they join a particular trade union or not. Given the history of Senator Bell's party, it was a pity that he skated over the importance of the word `voluntary'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would like to raise with Senator Bell is that for some 10 years his party was a strong supporter of voluntary unionism.

Maybe it was Senator Bell who voted with us to try to prevent compulsory student unionism. In that case, I would urge him to go back to the arguments that he used in those days to support our position. Nonetheless, he has conceded the nub of my point&mdash;that he has reversed his previous position on this quite important issue which is before the chamber today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A pattern is now emerging with the Australian Democrats. On another occasion we had very strong support for small business and farmers opposing the removal of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. His party was very strong in tackling the problem of big unions. In recent years the whole thrust of Senator Bell's party's policy has been dropped. Unfortunately, it was dropped and modified at the very time he came into this position as the Democrats' industrial relations spokesperson. I think that is a pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community is starting to learn that Senator Bell's party, under Senator Kernot, will tend to support the power and privileges of unions. I think that is a great pity. I suggest to Senator Bell that it is out of line with the way most of his supporters feel. Although this is not a particularly important bill, in the sense that it does not affect vast numbers of Australians, it would have gone better for Senator Bell if he had stuck to his previously stated position on this. The fact is that he has reversed his position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some thoughtful comments were made by Senator Chris Evans on this issue. I was interested in his comments because he raised the issue of international conventions and covenants and how they should affect Australian law. He said that the Western Australian education minister said that we should look at an international covenant which he felt may have applied to this bill. Given the nature of the arguments that we constantly hear from the Labor Party and the Democrats on the need to be more attuned to international treaties and covenants, he raised an interesting argument. Undoubtedly, he put that argument forward in an attempt to show that the sorts of things which are important to the Labor Party are also consistent with the general thrust of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important issue before this chamber is how much Australian law should be influenced by UN treaties&mdash;treaties which have never been endorsed by the Australian people and Australian parliaments. The argument is constantly put forward that `this law must be put in place' or `that law must be put in place' because there is a UN treaty&mdash;signed by Senator Gareth Evans or Mr Keating but not passed by this parliament&mdash;which says it must. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an interesting issue. As Senator Schacht has indicated, these treaties do erode the sovereignty and independence of our nation. It always surprises me that the Senator Evanses and Mr Keatings of this world, the great republicans of this nation, so constantly talk about the independence of Australia&mdash;which as a strong supporter of our current constitution, I ardently support&mdash;while at the same time taking steps which erode the sovereignty and independence of our nation by following these UN treaties and instruments. The ability of Australian citizens to take complaints out of Australia to UN committees is a very significant change in the nature of law in this country and certainly overturns the Australia Act, which was brought in by a Labor government only five years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans raised a useful point. We have signed so many of these instruments and signed so many of these treaties that no-one really knows what is contained in all these inevitable clauses. One day they may well come back to haunt the Labor Party. Mr Goss, the Premier of Queensland, was very aware of that. It is true that there are ILO conventions which talk about freedom of association and voluntary unionism. If our party ever decided to use such a convention, we could wipe out the closed shops in this country. We would destroy much of the basis of the compulsory membership of trade unions. That is why I say to Labor Party members who may be prepared to follow Senator Gareth Evans and Mr Keating down this UN path that it may come back to haunt them, particularly from that base of support which they so constantly need and rely on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was useful for Senator Chris Evans to bring this matter to the chamber. Whatever legal opinions he may have been able to adduce, the essential issue of whether Australian law should be controlled and directly influenced by UN treaties is an important issue and undoubtedly a topic which will be returned to on a number of other occasions in the forthcoming months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I strongly support the arguments that my colleagues have put forward so well, to be quite frank. There is an issue of principle here. Principle is always difficult for the Labor Party to deal with, because it is a party that has very few principles. Nonetheless, the principle that was so well expressed by Senator Campbell and Senator Ellison is important; that is, the need for people to have choice and not to be forced to join unions. I strongly support their remarks. </PARA>

The debate is about whether the Commonwealth government should have the power to reduce the grant to any given state because that state has said to its students, `You will have a choice as to whether or not you join a student union'. The government wishes to say that, if a state government gives students free choice, it should have its states grant reduced. We in the National and Liberal parties disagree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of the rhetoric and the sophistry that we have heard from the other side and from the Democrats, it is an immutable fact that those of us in the National and Liberal parties are supporting free speech and freedom of association. More importantly, we do not believe that the Commonwealth government should have an overreaching power to dictate to the state governments how their money should be spent, because that is effectively what happens. A state government that gives students free choice as to whether they want to join a union has its states grant reduced and the money given to a student union. In effect, the Commonwealth is allocating that money for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere in the constitution can I find any provision that says that the Commonwealth government should have a power in relation to an untied grant to direct that money and not to give it to the relevant state government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, tying untied grants. It is a very dangerous precedent for this chamber to support the bill that the government has brought before it. It is a very dangerous precedent for this chamber not to support the amendment moved by the Liberal and National parties here today. If we do not support the coalition's amendment, then what we effectively say is that from now on the Commonwealth government can dictate to state governments on any issue of policy on the basis that if the state government takes a certain course of action the Commonwealth will take away more of its money&mdash;take away more of its untied grant and spend it for it. It destroys the whole concept of the states having a right to exercise power in their own state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere in the constitution did our founding fathers say that the Commonwealth should have a power to dictate how states spend their money in the valid exercise of those state powers. That is what this debate is about. It is about whether we support coercion&mdash;both by the federal government over the state governments and by student unions over individuals&mdash;or whether we really believe in freedom and free choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that in the past some of the people who have spoken in this debate have supported some of the most spurious claims about a right to do this and a right to do that. Yet they are now saying that there should be no right for students to choose whether or not they want to belong to a student union. Senator Kemp has very eloquently said today that if we follow the arguments of Senator Bell and the government and believe that the services provided by student unions are invaluable&mdash;that they cannot be done without&mdash;then, of course, the students would happily cough up the money and join the student union. It seems to us that the only people who really believe that those services are so invaluable are the members of the government, the members of the Democrats and some members of the executives of the student unions in question, because, given a chance, the students themselves do not see it that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make a brief comment about when I was at university, which was not that long ago. We did not have compulsory student unionism. The first thing I did when I got to university, quite interestingly enough, was to join the Oxford Union Society. But it was not a union; it was a debating society. There was an Oxford University students union but my junior common room in my college chose not to have anything at all to do with the Oxford University students union. Our junior common room was non-political. We had absolutely no interest in politics and we certainly had absolutely no interest in the Oxford University students union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good thing about it, I suppose, was that we did not see much of the executive of the Oxford University students union because most of them were busy being involved in die-ins outside Greenham Common and riots in the centre of London. They certainly were not representing our viewpoint; they were not doing the sorts of things that we were interested in. So we said, `We don't want to have anything to do with it'. And do you know what? The amazing thing is that Oxford University continued on undeterred, our junior common room continued on undeterred, and I was not disadvantaged in the slightest because I was not a member of the Oxford University student union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were some points that I wanted to address but which I did not get time to in my first contribution. The first one is in response to the interjection of Senator McMullan that we did not support the state government this time last year because we chose to support state governments that are Liberal governments. Clearly, had we wanted to use the tactics this government is using to bribe or induce the Western Australian government not to do what it is doing in relation to voluntarism on campus, we would have moved an amendment this time last year to penalise a state government to in fact ensure that there was compulsion on campus. Of course, we did not do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan would know that it certainly would not be our policy to create a similar form of bribery in relation to a state government to cause it to adopt some other form of policy. Our action here is intended to ensure that any government across Australia that seeks to take any action in relation to compulsion or voluntarism in relation to student membership is not penalised either way. That is the principle.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator O'Chee actually hit the nail on the head. This is the first time that I know of in my experience, which is only brief, that the government is actually using an untied general purpose grant and saying that it is going to tie it; that is, if a state does not do this particular action the government will take money away from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Democrats are going along with a very dangerous precedent. I understand, even though I do not agree with them, their views about unions on campus. Of course, they are arguments I have heard for many years. They are in fact arguments we have within the Liberal Party. We have had some very bitter battles with what were known as the `guildies' within the party&mdash;some of the people who had become involved in the guild. Michael Leishman, who was a guild president, if I remember correctly&mdash;I hope I do not hurt him&mdash;used to speak at our state conferences very much in favour of the very arguments Senator Robert Bell has used. He said that it is not a union; it is more of a local government-type situation. We used to have very good debates at our state conferences and Young Liberals conferences and so forth. We usually won by about 500 votes to 4, but we always had good debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard those arguments before and I do not agree with them. As I said earlier, that is really not the point of the debate here. As Senator McMullan said by way of interjection, Western Australian students will get freedom of association. It is just a question of how much it will cost the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to my next point, one that has yet to be addressed: as student guilds or associations come to rely more and more upon federal government moneys to subsidise their membership revenue, they will become more and more reliant upon the discretion of the federal minister. In the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill, which I have not read since last year but which is still sharply focused in my mind, the specific clause about how the money goes to the student unions or institutions clearly set out, I believe, that it was a matter of ministerial discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think an issue this chamber will have to deal with sooner or later, probably within the next 12 months, is under what regulations and criteria that money is given to student unions. Take the extreme and probably stupid and silly example of a campus with thousands of people, only a few&mdash;10 or 15&mdash;of whom are members of the union. Clearly, that would be an outrageously unrepresentative student union. I am sure that any sensible minister&mdash;and we have some sensible ministers&mdash;would not want to pay millions of dollars to such a student organisation that was clearly unrepresentative. So in that position the minister will have to make some sort of decision on whether or not the government gives millions of dollars to student unions. That is one worry, and we will have to deal with that. There will have to be regulations to decide what sorts of unions we want to fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding will start flowing from Commonwealth taxpayers' money and ministers will have to make decisions. Let us hope the decisions are made in a slightly more open, accountable and transparent way than were Minister Kelly's decisions on sporting grants. That is a very real worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will become a matter of ministerial discretion. Decisions will have to be made here in Canberra about whether or not the unions get taxpayers' money. So the unions themselves will become more and more reliant on the fiat of the government in Canberra and therefore become, I guess, less independent and less able to express views that may be in opposition to a federal government. That should be a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this provision does make it through today, if we are not successful in deleting clause 20 from the bill, as sure as night follows day&mdash;to use a hackneyed cliche&mdash;this will become an issue we will have to deal with. Money will flow to unions from Canberra; we will be taking money away from Australian taxpayers and sending it to student unions; and they will lose some of that independence that I am sure the Democrats would like to see retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now address some of the comments made by Senator Woodley, particularly what he described as the state government interfering in the autonomy of institutions. If that is the case, what the state government of Western Australia, and in particular my good friend and colleague the Hon. Norman Moore, the minister, are doing is ensuring that individuals do have the freedom to choose not to join a union. If that is called interfering in the autonomy of institutions, so be it. If a government needs to ensure that a young Australian does have that freedom when he or she goes to campus, so be it: that is interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have to interfere to ensure that when 16- or 17-year-old Australians, Western Australians in particular, go to the University of Western Australia, Curtin University, Murdoch University or any of the other campuses around the place they are not confronted with a big sign on the front of the university saying `no ticket, no start' or `no guild membership fees, no degree', I think it is a very good idea for us to do so and to pull that sign down. But, again, that is me putting my view on student union voluntarism. The issue before us&mdash;and I plead with Senator Bell to see it this way&mdash;is whether or not we should be pouring taxpayers' money into student unions and, as Senator O'Chee said, tying untied grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of whether the services provided by unions are seen as valuable or not valuable by the students who should use those services, Senator Woodley referred to Mark Dale, who works on the staff of the minister, Norman Moore, and who is a very strong advocate of voluntary student unionism. He has worked very hard on this issue since he has been on the staff of Norman Moore and I believe that he has spoken to Senator Woodley as a friend on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Mark was a welfare officer on the campus he was on. One of the arguments used by, I am sure, the Democrats and those who oppose us on voluntary student unionism is that the counselling and welfare services provided by the guild are some of the most important. I do not seek to enter into that argument, but the fact of the matter is that Mark Dale has been a welfare officer on campus. He knows probably better than anybody in this chamber how important the duties of a welfare officer are. Yet Mark Dale is saying, `Voluntary student unionism is vital'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that refutes in some way Senator Woodley's use of Mark Dale as some sort of reference because he was a welfare officer on the campus in Queensland. The fact is that Mark Dale, to use Senator Woodley's words, was a very effective and good welfare officer on the campus in Queensland; yet Mark Dale, not so many months after he gave up his job as a welfare officer, is one of the most forthright advocates of voluntarism on campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making a last plea to the Democrats to think about the road down which they are now taking a step, to think about what they are going to do in terms of using Commonwealth taxpayers' moneys to fund student unions, to think about the lack of autonomy those unions will suffer because of that funding, and to think about the principle that is being established in ensuring that we can now start tying general purpose grants and using bribes through the general purpose grants process to seek to change policy at a state level. I think it is a very dangerous precedent we are setting. I know that Senator Bell has private concerns about it but has made a decision, and I make this last minute plea to him to support our move to defeat this obnoxious clause. </PARA>

But because we are in committee stage I will use the opportunity to speak again to address a couple of the inaccuracies that were perpetrated, in particular by Senator MacGibbon. Senator MacGibbon said quite blatantly that I had claimed that every student was a member of the ALP. I certainly did not claim that; in fact, I demonstrated the opposite by referring to the political history of Senator Ellison, who is sitting directly behind Senator MacGibbon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon also questioned whether I had ever been to a university campus. In his usual snide manner, he suggested that I had probably been to something like a second rate Hobart TAFE college. Not only is that an insult to TAFE which I think TAFE institutions should take on board and consider, but it also indicates an inability to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Handbook</EMPHASIS>, which would reveal that I obtained my three degrees from two different campuses. The fact is that, since then, in my capacity as education spokesperson I have visited several dozen others and been observant in my visitations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important to address one of the claims made by Senator Kemp, who characterised the Democrats' position as supporting compulsory unionism. He obviously missed the point of the whole debate we have embarked upon here. As well as being dangerously misleading as a result of his capacity to understand what our policy is, he has obviously not taken notice of the amendments and achievements we have brought to the industrial relations scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it was through the Democrats' work in the July 1992 industrial relations legislation, commonly referred to as the subcontractors' legislation, that we were able to have contained within that legislation a provision which makes it an offence to coerce any person to belong to a union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question here, which seems to have escaped Senator Kemp, is whether student unions are, in fact, trade unions. I contend that they are not. I appreciate Senator Campbell's approach to this matter&mdash;a polite, considerate and considered discussion of the merits of that argument. I will not rehearse the argument again, I simply restate the position that I took in the debate that it is  my contention that they are not. That is the basis of our position. That gives the lie to the claim by Senator Kemp regarding our position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the other thing which relates to it is our claim that part of the definition and part of the indication of the nature of the body is whether a student organisation, guild, union, association or whatever, is in fact affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I would be happy to be guided by the coalition as to whether any student organisation representing a full tertiary campus is affiliated with the ACTU. I think that would bring our argument down in flames. That point is germane to the whole discussion and it has been missed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand and appreciate what Senator Campbell said about the essence of this committee stage debate on the removal of clause 20, but the fact is that we have ended up in this wide ranging debate about the whole philosophy at this stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be a sparkling contribution, Senator. It seems there is a fallacy in linking this issue with the freedom of association question. The pseudo-economic argument that Senator Kemp sought to put fails to take into account that the sorts of goods we are talking about&mdash;which are provided, in the main, by these services&mdash;are public goods. Individuals faced with the decision whether or not to pay for those goods can assume that, if they do not pay and everyone else does, those goods will still be available. So each individual has an incentive not to contribute, irrespective of his or her judgment of the value of goods being provided. It is the fundamental, underlying rationale for the public provision of goods through taxation.

The argument that somehow the people in charge of these organisations will run away with these resources for a 12-month period without taking any notice of their members may be correct.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In any representative democracy, that is absolutely right. But if they go too far, results ensue and, in these circumstances, the time periods are very short. Senator Kemp raised an interesting point&mdash;a point which he raises often. It is not relevant to the issue, but he and Senator Evans had an interesting discussion about the impact of internationalisation on Australian law. I think Senator Kemp is wrong, but I welcome the fact that he raised that issue because it is an important one. He has his eyes steadfastly faced on the 1950s when this was not a problem. I think he is failing to understand the nature of the international relations between countries in the 20th century and the fact that these matters become Australian domestic law only when this parliament passes laws to make them so. Nevertheless, it is an important debate and I welcome it. That issue is a little tangential but he was not the first to raise it, and he and Senator Evans had a worthwhile discussion on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to make before concluding is that this is not an interference in the right of the government of Western Australia to pass the legislation which it seeks to pass. It is simply making the Western Australian government face the financial consequences. At the moment, these services are provided by university institutions through the fees they raise on behalf of students and passed to student associations which then fund the services. But the services will need to be continued to be provided and, if the state government believes that the funds should be provided otherwise, let it face up to the economic and financial consequences of doing so&mdash;not the rest of Australia. That is what we are doing. It is up to the Western Australian government whether or not it chooses to proceed. It is properly a matter of judgment for it to face up to the consequences of its decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I thought a very effective argument was put in response to a concern about interference with student association fees. The South Australian Liberal Party spokesperson for education, Mr Such, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not be attacking or in any way focusing on student union fees. Unlike what may be said in other states or at other levels of government, we will not be trying to interfere in how student unions operate&mdash;operate what I believe is basically a welfare-type arrangement. Students that do not like the decisions on how the money is used should get involved and make sure it is spent in the way the students want it spent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill, which is substantially in line with what the coalition has been advocating for some time and, clearly, in some parts, is in direct response to coalition pressure. However, I would like to comment on some of the main provisions of the bill and, at the same time, indicate the coalition attitude to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third and final set of amendments to the ATSIC Act flowing from recommendations contained in ATSIC's review report to the minister which was tabled in parliament earlier this year. This review was carried out as a requirement under section 26 of the ATSIC Act 1989, the principal act covering that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It proposes amendments to that act which will, firstly, establish the Torres Strait Regional Authority to replace the existing Torres Strait Regional Council with the objective of cutting down on the volume of duplication with ATSIC and other bodies operating in the Torres Strait Islands. Secondly, it will devolve some financial functions to the regional councils but will try to ensure that there will also be safeguards to deal with the regional councils that do not perform properly. Thirdly, it will establish the Electoral Review Panel. Fourthly, it will strengthen the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions in the bill for the Torres Strait regional authorities propose the establishment of an independent Torres Strait Regional Authority to replace the current Torres Strait Regional Council. These provisions occupy a major part of the bill. The Torres Strait Regional Authority will be established as a body corporate and will operate in much the same way as ATSIC. The provisions cover things such as: funding powers, including the appointment of advisory committees and the disclosure of pecuniary interests; the provision of 20 elected members and election procedures; the appointment of a general manager by the minister; staff appointments; and reporting requirements, such as estimates of expenditure, annual reports and financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition recognises the practicality and advantages of rationalising multiple government input into the Torres Strait, we understand from visits there that many people living in the Torres Strait Islands have aspirations towards a type of self-determining rule similar to Norfolk Island or the Cook Islands. The coalition's support of these rationalisation measures does not reflect support for some form of independence, and certainly not for sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems with some of the proposals in that there are people who have lived in the Torres Strait Islands for some time who are not indigenous people. I give the examples of members of the European, Chinese and Japanese populations. Rather than making a set of laws for one section of the population, we feel that there should be no blank cheque given by these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a purely federal concern; it also involves the Queensland state government. That complicates the debate somewhat. To some extent, these proposals would need to get through state laws dealing with police and schools, and that needs to be taken into account. Whilst we are supportive, we appreciate that the islanders wish to maintain their cultural integrity and want their own body outside ATSIC. However, at this stage, we emphasise that the coalition is not making a commitment to sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards the devolution of powers to the regional council, this bill strengthens reporting arrangements and accountability requirements for those regional councils. It provides them with increased funding responsibilities with wider powers to approve funds and issue guarantees. These powers may also be suspended if deemed necessary by the ATSIC chairman. The regional councils will now be required to provide draft budgets which are tied to a regional plan for their region. ATSIC will have the power to remove regional councillors who fail to perform functions or comply with budgetary or reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition wishes to comment that this devolution of power to regional councils comes from the ATSIC bureaucracy, which should cut back its size. I would hope that this means that the money saved can be put towards projects on the ground so that the money gets to the people who need it for essential services. The coalition welcomes these moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also welcome moves in the bill which strengthen the  power of ATSIC to deal with those who do not perform satisfactorily. This is essential in any organisation, regardless of size, in order to achieve peak performance and optimum accountability. It is important to remember that a crucial aspect of self-determination resting with regional councils lies in their function to allocate funding. Perhaps it is testimony to their success in handling this role that a large number of complaints against them are from those who have failed to convince the regional councils of their eligibility for funding. In other words, they do not distribute money willy-nilly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also significantly expand the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include regular audit and evaluation of ATSIC, Aboriginal Hostels Limited, the Commercial Development Corporation and the Torres Straight Regional Authority. It also provides the mechanism to allow the minister or ATSIC to request the evaluation and audit of particular aspects of operation of regional councils, any individual, body corporate or unincorporated body receiving one or more grants or loans from ATSIC, and any borrowers whose loans have been guaranteed by ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be the coalition's intent in government to review where the Office of Evaluation and Audit is actually situated within the structure of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to make it even more independent. But we are pleased that the government has finally moved&mdash;obviously under pressure from the opposition&mdash;to require organisations receiving funding from ATSIC to be accountable for the allocation of that funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also other areas of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations receiving government funds through other mechanisms which are not touched by this legislation, and therefore not subject to this added scrutiny. The coalition would like to see the same scrutiny applied to those outside the ATSIC funding umbrella. We would also like to ensure that the function of the Office of Evaluation and Audit is not conducted on an ad hoc basis with auditing and evaluation requests merely conducted at the whim of the minister or the commission, which is how this bill is set up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore our intention to move an amendment&mdash;and I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage of the bill&mdash;which requires the Office of Evaluation and Audit to perform regular evaluation and audit of those receiving funding through ATSIC. The object of our amendment is not just to provide the option for audit and evaluation, but to make this a requirement. Obviously the amount of work that this will involve will vary according to the nature of the organisation and the size of the grant or funding. Importantly, organisations will be held accountable for their actions, and this is no more nor less than we would expect in any area of government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth item to be dealt with by this bill is the Electoral Review Panel. The purpose of this section is to review boundaries and the groupings of the regions and wards, and review the electoral system generally, reporting to the minister, and ensuring that such a review is independent and objective. There have been criticisms that the arrangements for the December elections have been carried out too hastily, without adequate consultation, particularly in relation to the planned system of wards.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the coalition is in favour of the Electoral Review Panel which will have ample time for consultation and planning prior to the next set of elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the bill is substantially in line with what the coalition has been advocating for some time. Whilst we do not oppose the bill, I have taken the opportunity to constructively highlight areas for further improvements. We make the point that we do not see the setting up of the Torres Strait Regional Authority as a commitment of any sort to separate sovereignty. We flag our possible intent in government to move the Office of Evaluation and Audit out of ATSIC. I will be moving an amendment which will cover the other parts of our concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993. One of the most important amendments proposed in this bill creates a separate Torres Strait Regional Authority which will now have powers and functions similar to ATSIC in relation to Aboriginals and Islanders in the Torres Strait. The Senate is debating such an amendment for the second time. Four years ago when ATSIC legislation was before the Senate, the coalition moved amendments to give the Torres Strait Islanders separate recognition in a regional council. This amendment gives the Islanders their own form of ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a government which casts itself in the role of leading a reconciliation process, it has been very strong on rhetoric yet very slow to do the obvious&mdash;it has taken up to four years just to do the things it had to do for the Torres Strait. Following my question in the Senate earlier this week to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Ray, it is now on the public record that the federal government has opened a dialogue with the Torres Strait Islanders on the means to achieve greater self-government. Following discussions between the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and Torres Strait Islanders, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wrote to the Queensland Premier and the Torres Strait Island Coordinating Council to propose a preliminary meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today is seen by the Islanders as just a first step towards a form of self-government, having free association with Australia. It is, therefore, relevant to anticipate what those future steps might involve and what support is to be given to them by state and federal governments. There is a lot of confusion within the government ranks about the level of commitment to Torres Strait self-government. On Wednesday Senator Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are many complex issues that would have to be discussed before this matter could be brought to fruition one way or the other, including the philosophical concept of whether it is the correct thing to do even before we settle the details.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 5 November entitled `Islander self-governing by 2001: Tickner' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Visiting the Torres Strait to discuss moves for greater self-determination with island leaders and community groups, Mr Tickner told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> self-government by 2,001 was "highly likely" provided Torres Strait residents established a uniform goal.</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious that the Aboriginal and Islander affairs minister has already committed himself and the government to seeing this process through. Meanwhile, Senator Robert Ray and the rest of the cabinet are left behind to muse over whether it is the correct thing to do or not&mdash;I include Senator Collins in this; I wish he would pay attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the Cape York Land Council, Mr Noel Pearson, seems to know more about the commitment given to the islands by Mr Tickner than the rest of the government. In an interview with Paul Lyneham on 10 November, Mr Lyneham asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and your statement today that Mabo has laid the basis for some future form of self-government within the nation&mdash;that's going to unsettle the horses as well, isn't it?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pearson replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is nothing to be alarmed about. There's discussions particularly taking place in the Torres Strait where the real agenda is self-determination for the indigenous people of that region. You have to recall the fact that there are self-determination arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ray was at pains to explain that self-government for the Torres Strait was a long-term aspiration and the substantial details of the proposal by the Islanders have not yet been put forward. Yet only yesterday the Chairman of the ICC, Mr Gaetano Lui, told ABC radio that the ball was fairly in the government's court. Both federal and Queensland governments had been sent their proposals. Mr Lui complained about the lack of response from the state minister, Anne Warner. The desire for self government by the year 2001 was also expressed in the regional council's Torres Strait development plan. The Islanders believe they have reached a negotiating stage with the government. Mr Lui said that the time for consultation is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mabo has given Islanders a position of strength, and the federal minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders has led them to believe that the government is right behind their self-government aims. Having had the Mabo glory taken away from him by the Prime Minister and the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker), Mr Tickner is now seeking political glory on his own. The problem is, as Senator Ray pointed out, that there are many complex issues to be discussed. In his enthusiasm to make a name for himself, Mr Tickner may be guilty of overlooking these complexities and, indeed, the welfare of the Islanders themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gaetano Lui has mentioned that the Islanders were looking to learn from various types of self-government, such as that used by the Cook Islands and Norfolk Island, in setting up their own form of self-determination which, in his words, would then become a model for Aboriginal people&mdash;I think we could say Islander people. I have been invited to the islands many times and I have spent much time with Gaetano and his family, including Mr Gaetano Lui senior, one of the true elder statesmen of the island. I have always been greeted with great warmth and hospitality. I have visited many of the Torres Strait Islands and talked with the elders and councillors. Gaetano is a personal friend of mine, and he has sent me the regional council's decision and recommendations on self-government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first step is accomplished by today's bill&mdash;the setting up of a separate regional authority for the Torres Strait Islands. The second stage is the devolution of other Commonwealth funds for services in the Torres Strait to the new authority. The third stage is the devolution of the Queensland government's funds for services in the Torres Strait to the new authority. I quote from the regional council's recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next stage will be to include the standard government function of maintaining peace, good order and government, ultimately leading the authority to become an essential model for a centralised form of government having free association with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>What person amongst us does not yearn to be master of his own destiny, to control the forces around us to our own liking and beliefs? It is understandable that the Torres Strait Islanders wish to distinguish themselves from the Aboriginal-dominated ATSIC. The coalition has always supported them on this view. I claim it an honour that I moved an amendment when the ATSIC bill went through, and I had the support of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understandable that the Islanders should wish to take part in streamlining and making delivery of government services to the Torres Strait more efficient and useful. But is the desire for self-government, with free association with Australia, going to allow the Islanders to control events around them to their liking? What significant restraints on their activities will they lose? What freedoms will come from free association with Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gaetano Lui has mentioned the Cook Islands several times as a possible model for self-government. Firstly, it is important to remember that the Cook Islands were only ever New Zealand's to administer on behalf of the United Nations until the act of self-determination in 1965. The Torres Strait Islands, on the other hand, are as much a part of Australia as is Sydney or Melbourne; they are as much a part of the state of Queensland as is Mount Isa or the Gold Coast. Norfolk Island is a quite separate case. It was not part of a state but was a federal territory. The legal and constitutional implications of setting up self-government with free association with Australia are quite different, and in the case of the Torres Strait Islands would be very cumbersome. Norfolk Island was originally inhabited by Pitcairn Islanders, who in those days had no association with Australia. They do not consider themselves as part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the Queensland government relinquishes the Torres Strait Islands to the Commonwealth as a territory, a referendum would be necessary to set up another state. The regional council's aim of providing the standard government function of maintaining peace, good order and government, suggests a reference to a territory or a state rather than a local government. I have been advised that the Islanders' call for self-government, based on free association with Australia, goes far beyond the Norfolk Island model, and it suggests an even more autonomous state being not part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Islanders say they would still want Australia to look after foreign affairs and defence. This is like the Cook Islands, where they have their own parliament and free association with New Zealand. There are some 17,000 Cook Islanders living on the islands and another 20,000 in New Zealand. Income is mostly from tourism and remittances from relatives in New Zealand. The New Zealand government provided budget support in terms of a cash grant of $8.5 million&mdash;that is not a lot of money&mdash;in 1992-93 and $8.3 million this year. There is also an allocation for projects and training assistance, which was $5.5 million in 1992-93 and $5.2 million this year. They also receive several smaller packages from places such as the United Nations, Australia, the US, and so on, but they would not add up to much more than $1 million. </PARA>

There is a commitment to self-reliance by the year 2008, when New Zealand will no longer be required to give the Cook Islanders any budgetary assistance. The Cook Islanders are moving steadily towards independence, with all the responsibility and financial problems that will entail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Has the minister noted the comments of the Queensland Labor Premier, Wayne Goss, that the government's Native Title Bill is `complex, difficult to understand and poorly drafted'?  Is the problem not that, in order to get around the fact that the administration of land titles is a responsibility of the states, the government has had to fashion an incredibly complex national scheme?  As a result of the government's choice to intrude into this area of state responsibility, is the Commonwealth government not a major contributor to the very uncertainty about which Mr Goss is expressing concern?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen Premier Goss's comments which Senator Hill quoted on that. I agree that it is complex. I agree that it is difficult to understand. I do not agree that it is poorly drafted. The main thrust of Senator Hill's question is: why do we not do what the opposition has done? Why do we not just abrogate responsibility for this and leave it to the states?  Why not have eight different regimes, not just one, that confer different rights on Aboriginal Australians?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the easy way out. That means a political party can lack courage.

But we do not take Senator Hill's way out. We do not just leave it to the states. We have taken a lead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I do not think the minister has appreciated that it is the Queensland government, the Queensland Premier, that is complaining. But is it not the case already that there are different regimes of land title in each of the states, that it is a constitutionally correct position and that it has worked well?  What is so different then in relation to this other form of land title that we are dealing with here? In other words, instead of this business about abrogating responsibility, why could the government not accept that the constitution has been structured in a certain way that gives certain responsibilities to the states in relation to the administration of land title? It has worked well in relation to other land title. Why could it not work well in this instance?</PARA></TALK.START>

The Commonwealth was given power in 1967 by referendum, at the instigation of all parties in this chamber, to be responsible for certain matters to do with Aboriginal Australians. We are showing leadership on this particular issue because we know that states, left to their own devices, without some guidance will not come up with a proper regime that will be fair to Aboriginal Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1G4">Senator DEVEREUX</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Following the government's success in achieving major waterfront reforms in the restructuring of the stevedoring sector, which has allowed the focus to move now to other port services, is there any evidence that these reforms are resulting in lower charges for the end users, namely, Australia's exporters and importers?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3279" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to say that there is, and further evidence of the substantially improved performance of the Australian waterfront was released yesterday. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics reported on its development of a port interface cost index which identifies the costs in each segment of the transport chain from the warehouse to the wharf.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Gabble could stop for about 30 seconds, I would finish this answer. This initiative arose from last year's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> report from the inquiry into the efficiency of the interface between seaports and the land transport system by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics plans to publish the index every six months to measure changes in stevedoring rates, customs brokers fees, land transport charges and port related charges, which include port authority, government, towage and pilotage charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current index has compared waterfront costs in 1991 with those in 1992 and has found that total costs of international container movements through the waterfront fell by between five per cent and 11 per cent at Australia's major ports of Sydney and Melbourne. Stevedoring charges themselves declined over this period by a substantial 22 per cent. Shipping lines reduced the average planned stay of their ships in port by almost half a day per port call because of reform efficiency improvements. Container depots are now able to make cargo available five to seven days after ship arrival, compared with the previous average of 10 to 21 days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes an apparent decline in port related charges, which, importantly, includes those levied by the state controlled port authorities. However, it attributes this fall primarily to an increase in the number of containers exchanged per ship visit rather than a change in the underlying level of the charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the current index provides further evidence that the total costs of moving international cargo across the Australian waterfront have clearly and substantially fallen, the government fully recognises the need for continuing reform, particularly in port authorities and other services at the sea-land interface. In order to pursue this, I have provided Peter Morris, the chairman of the House of Representatives standing committee, with a further reference for that committee to inquire on an ongoing basis into the issues raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Warehouse to wharf</EMPHASIS> report about improving performance of the sea-land interface.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has been asked to give particular attention to encouraging participants in the transport system, and particularly the shippers, to recognise their role in improving overall performance. In this regard, the BTCE report provides detailed information which will assist shippers to understand the waterfront industry and raise their awareness of the costs involved in each separate link of the cargo handling chain.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services. The minister claimed in question time yesterday that the awarding of Australian artists creative fellowships is `resolved at arm's length from the government'. Is it true that in 1989 the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, attended the meeting at which the recipients of that year's fellowship awards were decided and that one of the recipients was his personal friend Mr Geoffrey Tozer? Is it true, as alleged in a Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> in July 1991, that the first fellowship to Mr Tozer was to renovate the St Benedict's convent in Queanbeyan for the purpose of setting up a music school&mdash;a project that was personally overseen by Mr Keating? Why, if no music school eventuated and the building is to be sold on 27 November, has Mr Tozer received an unprecedented second fellowship valued at $325,000 when the guidelines for the Keating fellowships state that second fellowships should be awarded only in exceptional circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is all a wonderful, headline grabbing, sad story of failing to recognise that Australian artists and the arts community believe that the Keatings are a very significant initiative in the support of arts and that the decision that was made to award this grant this year to Mr Tozer was made by a committee of distinguished Australians at arm's length from the government who were aware of the guidelines to which Senator Patterson refers. I acknowledge that, as far as I can recall, she describes them accurately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are aware of them. They judged a large number of high quality applicants and made the decision that the recipients as outlined in the announcements were those most appropriate to receive them. I have no reason to doubt the integrity of those people in the making of that decision. I have no reason to expect that any of those Australian citizens acted other than properly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not there and the Prime Minister was not there. The meeting took place. I do not know the nature of the discussion that took place; it would be inappropriate for them even to tell me. All I know is that a committee has been established about which, as far as I know, no criticism has been raised as to its objectivity. That committee is chaired by the chair of the Australia Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a couple of appointments to the committee this year and I am not aware that they have been the cause. Nobody has given me any indication that people have any desire to reflect on the integrity of those two distinguished Australian artists in the craft area and in the dance area. For that reason, the decision this year stands quite separate from any sleazy attempt to imply that somehow this is an improper decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never heard of a report that says that the grant was made to build some music institution. I am aware that Mr Tozer was associated with that but, to the best of my knowledge, the terms of the award were not related to that matter. He is a citizen and he is entitled to carry out those activities. Whether he does or not is of no interest or consequence to me. But to the best of my knowledge, the application which was made, which I have not seen&mdash;it goes to the committee quite independently&mdash;was related to his performance schedule and his recording schedule during the period in which he was a recipient of the fellowship, and his application on this occasion for the second round of grants similarly related to a continuation of his outstanding record of performance and recording, being internationally recognised as an outstanding concert pianist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a decision that will stand scrutiny as a proper recognition of an outstanding Australian artist. The nine people on the committee, who are honest Australians, should not have their reputations impugned so lightly. I know that those opposite come in to do that lightly, but I do not believe those citizens will take it lightly.</PARA>

Is it true that, as reported in the same article,  Mr Gengos produced a musical selection for Mr Tozer shortly before the awarding of his first fellowship?

The question of lawyers getting rich out of Mabo can be effectively answered only if this Senate is prepared to pass legislation, which the coalition has been urging us to do for weeks, to prevent Aboriginal people getting access to the Australian court system, like everybody else. That is the underlying factor behind a series of questions being run in here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Foss is an enthusiastic supporter of the homebirth movement and he has proposed over recent weeks that midwifery be provided to the women of Western Australia by making it Medicare rebatable. I was in Perth last week and met Mr Foss to discuss funding for midwife managed births and the concern that it remain an affordable option for people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I made to Mr Foss was that the current Commonwealth policy is not to rebate the midwifery service and there is no proposal to change that policy. However, what I put to Mr Foss was a creative solution to that problem. I think it will be very satisfactory as it meets the needs of women to make a choice about giving birth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been concerned about this matter because Western Australia is well behind in spending its money under the alternative birthing problem. This year it will have allocated to it $674,000. That includes $448,000 of unspent funds rolled over from two previous years. In Western Australia it is not spending its money on alternative birthing and that is a concern particularly as Mr Foss is wanting ways in which to assist women with the alternative birthing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a concern that many women who have contacted me directly and certainly contacted Mr Foss are not able to have the option of a choice of birth in Western Australia because of the unspent money under the alternative birthing program and because of obstruction by the AMA in that state. I was pleased to propose to Mr Foss that there are ways in which, under the allocation of alternative birthing money, salaried midwives can be appointed to hospitals with the opportunity to work in the hospital and also in the community to assist women to have homebirths if that is their choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That program is now being piloted in South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. It is available to women in northern parts of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. So the model is well under way. It is a perfectly constructive and useful way of using the allocation from the Commonwealth to Western Australia and also assisting women in their choice in giving birth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Foss was rather taken with the idea and is currently looking to working up the issue, particularly in terms of the cost implications.

There were 20 successful projects. They were selected on the basis that they best met criteria outlined in the guidelines.

Just because he is the only National Party senator from Victoria, I would not want to say who he was. Employment in the audiovisual sector is estimated at 20,000; exports of film and television programs are estimated at $65 million; and the total value of goods produced and supplied is $3.4 billion, of which the film industry made up $690 million. So, even in this limited audiovisual sector of the industry, we have at least 20,000 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Film in particular is an inherently labour intensive industry and, therefore, it has significant capacity to make a valuable contribution to employment. The cultural contribution is the most important aspect of the reason governments support arts organisations, the film industry and others. But it is important that we recognise its growing economic significance, and that is why governments continue to make assistance to nurture this sort of industry. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Entertainment products . . . are exemplars par excellence of the commodities which will increase in economic significance under the influence of such trends . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is talking about the trends of technological change. That is why so much emphasis was given in the budget to increased support for the arts. Around 31 per cent of the total federal arts budget now goes to support the film industry. Just to indicate that this is not something in our region that is uniquely recognised by the Australian government, the Singapore Minister for Information and the Arts said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to make Singapore a centre for the arts, partly for its own sake and partly because we need the arts to help make us a centre for brain services.</PARA>

In the cause of protection of children from violence by both men and women, the government has established the National Child Protection Council.

<PARA>Today in question time I asked Senator Bolkus, the Minister representing the Attorney-General, when we would be likely to receive the government's response to the family law committee report. The answer Senator Bolkus gave, for those who did not hear it in its entirety, was `soon'. I think it was arrogant and petulant, and I think the Senate should condemn it absolutely. For the benefit of Senator Bolkus and this government, there is a convention in this place that the government respond to committee reports within 90 days. It is now over a year since this report was presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act is a long and tortuous one. I first raised matters about the complaints my office received about five years ago. I initially sought to have a Senate select committee inquiry, but the government repeatedly told me that nothing was wrong with the Family Law Act and the family law system and that there had been sufficient reviews of the whole area of divorce in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enlisted the assistance of Senator Spindler from the Australian Democrats. He and I got our heads together. We bashed them against a brick wall for a while, because the government would not listen to us. We persisted and, in December 1990, the government finally and reluctantly agreed to such an inquiry but insisted that it be a joint inquiry. The committee received a total of 1,031 submissions. That is why I am so interested and why the minister was arrogant in his reply today. He hardly rose to his feet to say that the government's response would be released soon. People throughout Australia are today continuing to write to every electorate office around Australia with complaints about the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry was effectively chaired by Senator McKiernan. I have said in this place before that he did a fantastic job. We took evidence in every capital city as well as in a lot of regional centres. We produced a report a year ago as a result of those thousand-odd submissions. In my opinion, our 120 recommendations reflected a balanced, definitive analysis of the Family Law Act in Australia. It was a genuine attempt to assess the weaknesses in the present legislation and, I suggest, to offer appropriate and workable changes to the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people throughout Australia, both within and outside the legislative process, spent countless hours on the report's preparation. It was eagerly awaited. I believe they feel that the system has let them down. They now obviously realise that this government has let them down by not coming back and telling us something better than what the minister said today&mdash;that we will get the reply to that report soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it has been 12 months since the report was presented. About 40,000 people a year divorce in Australia. One in three first marriages are still ending in divorce and one in two marriages are ending in divorce. The minister did not even have the decency to give a considered reply. I took steps earlier today to inform the minister, Senator Bolkus, about what I was going to ask him. When I saw him in the centre of Parliament House this morning I gave him the import of what I was going to ask. I think he could have done a lot more for the people of Australia. I told him that I did not want to political point score; I still do not want to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus sent me a note at the end of question time that Mr Lavarch hopes to be able to respond by the end of the year or by January but that he is not yet in a position to give a formal date. At least he could have told the Senate that publicly rather than just saying that the government would respond soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Labor government has today shown its true commitment to the reform of the Family Law Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us reflect on what has happened in the 12 months since the report was presented to the parliament on 24 November 1992. In the intervening period there was an election. That meant that, for a time, the effective work of government was not proceeded with. Through an anomaly that occurred prior to the election, the election of the Attorney-General was delayed by over one month. There was a caretaker minister, Mr Kerr, but I think it was almost May before we had a portfolio minister directly in charge of and responsible for the Attorney-General's affairs. That obviously caused some delay in developing a response to what I consider to be a very good and worthwhile report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is receiving detailed consideration by all concerned. The government, when it responds to reports of the nature of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, does not just take the report and make decisions on its own. It tests those views with a number of bodies and organisations, including the Family Law Council and the Family Court. It seeks responses, and those responses are tested again and again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On reflection, I believe that the delay in responding to the report of the committee will probably be very beneficial. It is important that, in a major review of the Family Law Act, which has been in operation now for some 18 years, this time we get it right. My information is that there will be a response by the minister in the next two-week sitting of the Senate, and in a somewhat shorter time in the House of Representatives. I do not have a detailed date, as probably Minister Bolkus did not have a detailed date, to give in response to Senator Brownhill's question. </PARA>

I welcome Senator Brownhill's raising the matter. It is not something that I, as the former chairman of the committee, had forgotten about. Indeed, I have been pressing the matter along and, while I have a concern about the delay, I hope the government has used that 12-month period to undertake a full and deep consideration of the report and that, when it does respond, it will give detailed consideration to the benefit of all Australians, not just those that end up before the Family Court of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>The issue I raised in question time could not be more serious. It raises grave doubts about the propriety of the Prime Minister of Australia. Yesterday the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) stated that the awarding of these fellowships, ironically known as the Keatings, `is resolved at arm's length from the government'. The Prime Minister's office is quoted in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> as saying that the grant recipients were decided by a judging panel appointed by the Australia Council with absolutely no input from the Prime Minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> in May 1989, Bob Evans said in relation to Mr Keating:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He has deliberately chosen to keep the fellowships at arm's length from the council.</PARA>

<PARA>That is the sort of thing that goes on with the Churchill fellowships; recipients have to report in. The two-time winner, Geoffrey Tozer, has admitted that he was a catalyst for the awards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been informed by the Australia Council that one Paul Keating attended the meeting in 1989 at which the fellowships were decided, including the first fellowship for Mr Tozer. Who was on the advisory panel, the recruitment of which was supervised by Mr Keating? Who were the music representatives? One was Mr Ross Gengos from Abels Music in Manuka, a close personal friend of the Prime Minister, the man who has the Prime Minister's ear over CD copyright. The Prime Minister opened Mr Gengos's record shop. Mr Gengos's Abels also produced a record titled `Geoffrey Tozer in Concert' in 1987. Mr Gengos was still on the committee this year for Mr Tozer's second fellowship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other music representative on the panel in 1989 was Mr Reuben Fineberg. I am led to believe that Mr Fineberg is Mr Tozer's agent. I am told by people in the music world that he has taken a keen professional interest in Mr Tozer's career for some years. We are not questioning Mr Tozer's ability as a pianist. We recognise that our artists need to be rewarded. We want to make sure that the due process of those rewards is correct and proper and is seen to be correct and proper by the community and by the arts community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his submission for the first fellowship, what did Mr Tozer say he would do with his money?

Where is the music school? It does not exist. The building is up for sale and will be auctioned on 27 November. Mr Tozer received a further $325,000 in an unprecedented second fellowship. The guidelines for fellowship state:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), to a question without notice asked by Senator Reynolds this day, relating to unemployment arrangements for workers in the arts industry.</PARA>
<PARA>In question time today, Senator McMullan mentioned a press release of mine issued on 16 November relating to Senator McMullan's idea of artists going on jobsearch or, for want of a better term, on the dole. I issued that press release after Senator McMullan did an interview on channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> show last Sunday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that it was actually quite a good interview until Senator McMullan got to this point. To the viewers, Senator McMullan would seem like a very reasonable and pleasant man to watch on a Sunday morning. Even I was enjoying the interview until he got to the outrageous suggestion which I think he will never get through cabinet. He saw fit to announce it that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the pleasantness that Senator McMullan may show, beneath that veneer&mdash;it will not be too long before that veneer is exposed&mdash;he is still the old party machine man. He is the old political manipulator. We all know about that party machine which is incompetent in its administration and devious in its dealings. One only has to cast one's mind to the ALP headquarters down the road to remember the brewing and unfinished scandal associated with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan's proposal is to pay the dole&mdash;and that is what it is&mdash;to artists. He has not yet defined what he means by `artist'. I do not think he means high art, such as opera, ballet or painting. I think we can take it that what Senator McMullan really means are street theatres and chalk drawers. That would be more in line with Senator McMullan's plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I made in this press release is that this is discriminatory; more so, it is discriminatory against farmers. Those who seek to get paid the jobsearch allowance have to meet strict criteria in order to receive that allowance, and rightly so. They have to go through several interviews. They have to report back fortnightly. The farmers even have to be means tested. If necessary they must relocate in order to find a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To receive the jobsearch allowance applicants must meet these criteria. This is discriminating against those people in other professions who are out of work. For example, it discriminates against the engineers and farmers who are out of work and have spent the last two years trying to get the jobsearch allowance. They are discriminated against because of the means test limitation. Even the lawyers, solicitors and others who are unemployed at the moment have to meet the strict criteria in order to receive jobsearch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan's proposal is that the only criteria artists need to meet in order to receive the jobsearch allowance or the dole&mdash;let us give it its proper term in the street&mdash;is that they practice their art for two years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks about not only the extraordinary interview on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last night with Mr Conrad Black but also the even more extraordinary response from the Prime Minister this morning. What Mr Black essentially said last night was that in the run-up to the last federal election, to be precise in January 1992, in a meeting at Kirribilli House, Mr Keating indicated that if the Fairfax newspapers were balanced in their coverage the Prime Minister would entertain an application from Mr Black to raise the foreign ownership limits from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. In the event, that actually occurred after the election. There was a bit of toing and froing. Mr Dawkins, as Treasurer, was opposed to it, but it happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, new lows were reached in Australian politics because for the first time Mr Black was alleging that a government had made a decision in relation to foreign ownership not on any national interest criteria but specifically at the request of a media proprietor. It is one thing to acknowledge that media proprietors would like to be more in control than they are at present, if they do not already have 100 per cent control, and there is nothing particularly unusual about Conrad Black pushing his case in the way that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Mr Keating to then not only entertain the idea but effectively enter into an agreement to provide a political quid pro quo is utterly extraordinary. That is why we all waited with bated breath to hear his response. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS>, Mr Dawkins was at great pains to say, `Well, that's what Mr Black says, but that's only his side of the story and one has to hear the other side'. He was asked whether he stood by his press release of 20 April this year in which he said that the government will not countenance further increases in the permitted level of foreign involvement in mass circulation newspapers. He said that the government did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevance of that is that Mr Black was also asserting that when he saw Mr Keating earlier this week he asked Mr Keating whether he was prepared to go higher. Mr Black said last night that we can never get too much of a good thing and, as far as he was concerned, he would like at least 50 per cent but certainly he would like somewhere between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. In other words, he was putting an ambit claim on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Black had asked Mr Keating for his reading of what was feasible and how things looked. Mr Black said, `Mr Keating said that it would be premature to do anything at this point but that if I had some suggestions I should make them and he would be prepared to consider any suggestions'. In other words, Mr Black was again saying that the Prime Minister indicated his willingness to further increase the foreign ownership limit to accommodate Mr Black. Those are extraordinary allegations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just had a door-stop in Seattle by the Prime Minister in which he confirmed the accuracy of those reports. In many ways, I think he was boasting about it. His answers were breathtaking in their arrogance and amorality. When asked what he thought of the coverage of the Fairfax papers in the run-up to the last election, he said that he thought they were reasonable. We do not have to be too smart to work out what Mr Keating had in mind when he said that he wanted balanced coverage.

The proposition is that Mr Black said last night that Mr Keating said he wanted balanced coverage. Mr Keating was asked this morning whether he agreed that the coverage was balanced and he said it was reasonable. Mr Keating was asked whether he was prepared to entertain any further applications, and he said yes. He was asked, `Who are you to decide what is fair and accurate?

You make sure that your coverage is balanced and reasonable, and we'll give you a further increase in foreign ownership limits'. That is preposterous; it is shameless; it is unprincipled; it is utterly unscrupulous; and it is amoral. If Senator Schacht cannot tell the difference between right and wrong, he is no better than the Prime Minister whose only political creed is new cronyism, who believes and seems to flaunt it, that the more he can impose his will on others, the more he will prosper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that Mr Keating is a classic, living confirmation of Lord Acton's dictum that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. The arrogance of this man is breathtaking. It is utterly outrageous to be out there claiming that the government will allow an increase in foreign ownership if the press gets it right by the government's standards. In other words, Mr Keating is saying, `You do it my way and I'll fix it up in your way'. That is preposterous and outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht seems to see nothing wrong with that; he has no greater concept of political morality than his leader. I thought the Left of the ALP stood for something. I thought the Left had principles and that it would have been out there arguing that foreign ownership debates should be conducted in accordance with the merits; that is, whether or not there was a need to increase the intake of foreign resources, technology, manpower, skills and expertise&mdash;all those very necessary characteristics. If they are available in abundance in Australia we do not need to increase the limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the Left came from years ago. That is where it believed the debate should be. But what the debate is conducted on the basis of now is venality, almost political corruption. The government is saying, `We will increase limits to accommodate people who do the right thing by us'. If that is not utterly amoral, I do not know what is. That is why I think it is outrageous that the Prime Minister is flaunting his approach in this manner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the Liberal Party feigns indignation about the so-called bias of the Fairfax press when, for 100 years, it was run by the Fairfax family and was basically a broadsheet for the Liberal Party in Australia. At the state level, the Fairfax press in Sydney for 100 years never supported the Labor Party. Apparently, in 1943, 1961 and sometimes in the 1980s, it supported the federal Labor Party editorially, but for 100-plus years in the history of the Labor Party, the Fairfax press was unswerving in its support for the Liberal Party. Of course, in those days it only took a quiet chat from a Liberal Prime Minister or leader to Sir Warwick or one of the other Fairfaxes to fix everything up; nothing was ever debated, but that was the way things were then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the actual accusations of bias, Senator Alston, in my view, has to point out where the bias was during the coverage of the election campaign: which journalists were compromised; which journalists did not write factually; which journalists bent stories to favour the Labor Party during the four-week campaign in February and March of this year. He has to put the case up, name the journalists, point the finger at them and say, `Your coverage in this election campaign was biased'. The Prime Minister spoke to Mr Black and said what everybody in Australia would say was quite a reasonable comment: `We would like to see unbiased coverage in the election campaign so everybody gets a fair go'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we ask from the Liberal Party is that it name the journalists in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> who are biased in favour of the Labor Party.

The Taxation Institute does not agree with this contention. Rather, it is of the view that, with the pending extension of the self assessment system now is the most appropriate time to specifically legislate to protect and enshrine the rights of taxpayers and the duties and obligations of the ATO in administering taxing Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator McMullan has stated that rights such as the right to be treated equally under the law, to object against an assessment, to rely on a private Ruling, to seek an explanation, to be represented, the right to privacy and to have documents remain confidential when they are prepared by a lawyer are all presently enshrined in the law. In some of the examples provided, there is some limited protection provided in the taxing Acts. However, it is submitted, that in many of the examples cited by Senator McMullan, "these rights are not clear, are not well understood by either taxpayers or the ATO and are limited in nature. Additionally, there are many examples of areas where there is little or no protection given to taxpayers, which should be the subject of specifically legislated rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the right to object does not extend to a penalty of less than 20% of the tax payable. A specific right enabling a taxpayer to object and appeal against decisions made against them by the ATO in respect of actions taken during the course of an examination of their affairs or in respect of any determination of their liability to tax, would greatly extend a taxpayers rights in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The right of a taxpayer to obtain confidential information, should not be limited solely to information obtained from a lawyer. It should extend to advice obtained from any recognised adviser in respect to the tax affairs of the taxpayer. There is currently limited administrative recognition of this right. However, it is submitted that this right should be specifically enshrined in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is currently a right for a taxpayer to be represented by a legal adviser. This was confirmed in Dunkel v DFCT 91 ATC 4142. However, taxpayers do not presently have a right to have a non legally qualified adviser present. This is obviously unsatisfactory since many taxpayers obtain tax advice from accountants and tax agents who are not otherwise legally qualified. Consequently, this right needs to be specifically expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of a right which is not presently enshrined in the legislation is the right to reasonable certainty. This would mean that, where the law was unclear, a taxpayer would be given the benefit of the doubt. This was once an accepted rule of interpretation for taxing statutes. This right should operate to require a finding in a taxpayers favour if the law was so uncertain as to not enable a taxpayer to ascertain with reasonable certainty his or her liability with respect to particular activities engaged in or proposed to be engaged in. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is submitted that an important right which is not dealt with in any taxing statute is the right to expect equal treatment under the law and by the ATO. This, of course would not mean that a taxpayer's particular circumstances could not be taken into consideration. However, it would mean that all taxpayers would obtain equal treatment under the law, which is particularly important in relation to the exercise of discretions by the Commissioner. This would mean that a situation such as that which arose in David Jones Finance and Investments Pty Ltd v FCT 91 ATC 4315, would not arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many other instances where there is a need to develop and formally recognise taxpayer's rights and the "Taxpayer's Bill of Rights" drafted by the Taxation Institute discusses many of these in some detail. The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Michael Carmody in a speech to the National Institute of Accountants on 4 November 1993 referred to the need for the recognition of such rights. It is strongly submitted by the Taxation Institute that the only way such rights can be properly recognised is via a formal Taxpayer's Bill of Rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this place to raise a matter which has just been brought to my attention by way of a press release received from Mr Bob Gardini, who is, of course, the solicitor acting on behalf of two former employees at the Lodge. Mr Gardini's clients&mdash;honourable senators may remember&mdash;were formerly housekeepers at the Lodge who had had their employment terminated in a rather unsatisfactory manner. Their employment was terminated when they were phoned on a Sunday evening and told not to bother coming in to work on the Monday and that, if they did attempt to go in to work on the Monday, they would be turned away by the guards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now send over to Senator Sherry copies of two documents. I intend to read portions of one of them, which is the letter addressed to Mr Gardini's firm by Mr R.D. Beale, acting secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Of course, this has come to me via Mr Gardini's press release. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">FORMER LODGE HOUSEKEEPERS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 10 November 1993 to Dr Keating requesting reasons for the termination of your clients' employment at the Lodge, references going beyond the Certificates of Service already provided, an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ex gratia</EMPHASIS> payment and reimbursement of legal costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerning reasons for the decisions, I draw your attention to paragraph (y) of Schedule 2 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977</EMPHASIS> which excludes "decisions relating to. . . employing, or terminating the employment of staff, under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Member of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984"</EMPHASIS> from the requirements of section 13 of the AD(JR) Act. This exclusion reflects the policy underlying the MOP(S) Act that members and senators (including the Prime Minister on whose behalf Ms Tinney acted in relation to your clients) should have complete discretion in the employment of their personal staff.</PARA>
<PARA>This has angered Mr Gardini and it has angered his clients. This afternoon he has put out a press release in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO GAG HOUSEKEEPERS </PARA>
<PARA>I will quote a couple of portions of this press release. I note that in the press release, on behalf of his clients, Mr Gardini says that he has been instructed to say that they are disappointed that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has declined to give reasons why they were dismissed. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the comments made by an officer before a Senate Committee we do not consider it as acceptable for the Department to hide behind the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. Certain allegations have been made about the circumstances of our dismissal which are inconsistent with the issuing of a Certificate of Service by the Department. Because of the public airing of the circumstances of our dismissal we sought assurances from the Department that our service at the Lodge had been satisfactory so that we could seek alternative employment without having unsubstantiated allegations hanging over our heads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are shocked by the statement by the Acting Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that it would be in our "best interests for there to be no further publicity on the matter." This in our view is an attempt to silence us.</PARA>
<PARA>The press release goes on to make further statements. In fact, it calls for an independent inquiry into the circumstances of the housekeepers' dismissal and their request for compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point is that there are provisions under the relevant act, but in the estimates committee public servants sought to make what appear to be wholly unsubstantiated allegations against the two housekeepers&mdash;allegations which are not supported by the facts and certainly are not consistent with the issuing of certificates of service. In spite of these allegations having been made, under the privilege of the Senate, the government attempts to rely&mdash;and the Prime Minister attempts to rely&mdash;on the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. He is hiding behind the skirt of legislation which was intended for something completely different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the Prime Minister has absolutely no qualms about having public servants come into an estimates committee hearing and attack the two housekeepers, who could not defend themselves, and make all these baseless allegations. It is my understanding that it was not their fault&mdash;there were just understandable reasons why their employment was terminated. They do deserve to be treated in a proper fashion. I am as infuriated as Mr Gardini is that the Prime Minister thinks that the appropriate way to deal with his domestic staff is to sack them in this fashion&mdash;after all, staff deserve to be decently treated&mdash;to use public servants to malign them before a Senate estimates committee, to refuse to even give them the opportunity of having a reference, and to leave this hanging over their heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating claims to represent the working people of this country. I think that this is particularly disgusting behaviour. I do not think it is the sort of behaviour that any employer should indulge in. We have already seen how, when they went to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to get an explanation as to why their employment was terminated, they were intimidated by having sections of the Crimes Act read to them, including official secrets provisions&mdash;and now there is this carry-on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gardini and his clients are quite right in their indignation at the way they have been treated. I take this opportunity today to call on the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet&mdash;indeed, to call on Mr Keating himself&mdash;to start acting in a reasonable and proper way towards these people. They have put in good service and are asking for only the most fundamental of dignities, which is to get a reference attesting to their good service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have had to go through all of this. I do not think the Prime Minister intends to give them a reference now. But there was absolutely no need for it to come to this. It is Mr Keating's fault&mdash;nobody else's. There was, I understand, a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why they are no longer employed. They are, I understand, very good staff and it is unreasonable that they should be maligned in this fashion. </PARA>
