<TITLE>Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in the Federal Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) One of the most critical issues to the Vietnamese people today is the persecution of their freedom of religion and expression, which has been carried out by the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) since 1945. World media reports have shown consistently that this persecution has increased greatly since 1992, when Buddhists, despite violent repression by the GOSRV's armed forces, started asking for `real' freedom of religion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The continuation of the GOSRV's centralised and corrupt structure, as well it's failed and disorderly `economic renovation' and it's declared loyalty to the atheistic socialism, has seriously degraded the moral, cultural, family, economic and spiritual life of most Vietnamese people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The GOSRV's policy of oppressing religions has, since 1945, applied equally to Catholics, Protestants, Caodaists, Hoa Hao Buddhist members and, most seriously to the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UBCV) which represents the faith and spiritual life of 80% of 72 million Vietnamese.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)  As the rightful heir of the 2000-year old Buddhist tradition in Vietnam, the UBCV was formally formed in 1951 by all Buddhist sects, lineages and regional congregations. It is the sole legitimate umbrella Buddhist body in Vietnam despite the GOSRV's unsuccessful attempt, in 1981, to disband and forcibly replace it with the State-run Vietnam Buddhist Church (VBC), and instrument for the GOSRV's propaganda purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Despite being held under strict house arrest since February 1982 simply because of his opposition to the GOSRV's attempted disbandment to the UBCV and its formation of the State-controlled VBC, the Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang, a nominee for 1979 Nobel Peace Prize, has been repeatedly and patiently appealing to leaders of the Communist Party and the GOSRV to ask for:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a)the urgent restoration and legal recognition of the UBCV's independent status,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b)the separation of Church and State and the withdrawal of the GOSRV's control over, and politicisation of, the Buddhist church.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c)the release of all arrested clergy, including the Patriarch, along with thousands of other prisoners of conscience,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d)the return of, and compensation for, all confiscated and misused Church properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e)open negotiations, free of pre-conditions, between the leaders of the UBCV and the GOSRV to establish mutually agreed solutions to the current conflicts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In replying to these reasonable requests, the GOSRV has, in the last few months, ordered stricter surveillance of the Patriarch's place of confinement and placed bans on all of his external communications. Whoever tries to contact, visit, help or offer gifts to him are stopped, threatened, interrogated, bodily searched (and in some cases strip searched), etc. The Patriarch's straightforward appeals have not only been ignored by the Hanoi leaders, but have also been vilified as `anti-state', `reactionary', `creating division amongst Buddhist community', etc. by the GOSRV's mass media and it's nation-wide agencies, including it's own VBC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) All of the UBCV's brave clergy and lay members who openly declare their support for the UBCV's appeals and who have worked sincerely for the reconciliation between the State and the UBCV, also between the VBC and the UBCV, have been inhumanely and violently attacked by the GOSRV. In the last 12 months, hundred of monks, nuns and lay persons have been arrested and/or tortured, harshly interrogated, searched, investigated and threatened. Amongst them are the Venerables Thich Nhat Lien, Thich Tri Luc and Thich Khong Tanh (Oct&mdash;Nov 1992), Thich Thien An (Oct. 1992, tortured to death few days after arrested), Thich Hai Tang, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Thinh and about 50 lay members (5/6/93), Thich Hanh Duc, 17 other monks and about one hundred of lay followers (9/7/93) etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The GOSRV's violent attack and mass media campaign against Buddhists' appeal for Church independent have caused suffering to many thousands of people, resulting in increased instability for the whole country. Despite the GOSRV's current campaign to illogically calumniate them and to deceive the world, these monks and lay Buddhists are arrested, solely because of their aspiration to be involved and support their chosen church, the UBCV.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) To politicise the traditional Buddhist community in Vietnam, the GOSRV has publicly been, and is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a) recruiting members for the VBC by forcibly converting the UBCV's moderate clergy to join it, and arresting or exiling other leaders who refuse to do so. (The GOSRV's view of `religious freedom' is not in accord with natural human dignity and heritage, but a rare favour given reluctantly on the terms of the State),</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">b) forcing the VBC to include, in it's Charter, `Socialism' as it's third aim of service&mdash;the other two, which originated from UBCV Charter, are People and Buddhism,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">c) creating mutual distrust and conflicts between the lay Buddhist community and their clergy or amongst the clergy themselves by appointing VBC senior leaders to artificial political positions, and by closely controlling and intervening in the limited activities it is permitted to perform training programs such as ordination procedures, seniority promotions, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">d) requiring the VBC to make frequent political statements supporting the GOSRV's inconsistent policies, with the consequence of eroding the VBC's religious identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">e) directing the VBC to start a nation-wide campaign accusing the UBCV of having political ambitions, and forcing it to declare the VBC as the `only legitimate Buddhist authority' and its `everlasting loyalty' to the GOSRV. This is whilst the GOSRV is facing huge pressure and condemnation from the international community about it's oppressive attitude to the Buddhists and it's systematic violation to all human rights of all non-party-cadre citizens in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10). The GOSRV's exclusively economic renovation has not, and can not, lead to democratisation or potentials which will allow long-overdue human rights to it's citizens, such as freedom to select their own political aspirations, ways of expressions, religions, education, employment, place of resident, etc. The greater it's economic strength, the more determined and confident the GOSRV is in it's opposition to such a democratisation process and the worse it's treatment of it's citizens becomes. This causes ever greater social instability and a sense of total hopelessness for Vietnam's future, and more broadly, prevents the development of stability in the SE Asia region as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11). As it's history has proved, if the UBCV is completely free and independent of political intervention, it would be a most beneficial part of, and the best spiritual force to contribute to, a humanitarian and ethically orientated redevelopment process for Vietnam.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 7 April 1993 the Hon Stephen Loosley wrote to my colleague the Hon Kim Beazley MP about the AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY Supplement Regulations. Senator Loosley's letter has been referred to me as Minister responsible for AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Loosley expressed concern about decision and review procedures under Regulation 14 of the AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY Supplement Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you may be aware, under Sections 20-24 of the Student Assistance Act 1973, if a student considers that application of the AUSTUDY rules may have been incorrect he or she can ask that a more senior officer consider the Department's decision. If the student still disagrees he or she may ask for a review of the matter by the Student Assistance Review Tribunal. Although the Tribunal is an independent body there is a requirement, as there is for the Minister and the Department, that it reach decisions within the framework of the student assistance legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under ABSTUDY policy if a student is unhappy with a decision made in respect of his or her application for assistance then he or she may ask for a review of that decision by a more senior officer. If unhappy with the senior officer's decision the student may appeal to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same provisions have been extended to students who are unhappy with a decision made under the regulations relating to the AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY Supplement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Senator Stephen Loosley's letter of 19 August 193 to the Hon Kim Beazley MP regarding the AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY Supplement Regulations. Senator Loosley's letter has been referred to me as Minister responsible for the AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Loosley asked for further information about broader aspects of both the AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY schemes, including the Supplement. General comments about the schemes, with particular reference to review mechanisms, are given below. Reference is also made to explanatory material that may be of assistance (copies are enclosed).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTUDY schemes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AUSTUDY scheme is set up under the Student Assistance Act 1973. More detailed provisions relating to who can get AUSTUDY and how much AUSTUDY is payable are contained in the AUSTUDY Regulations. General information about AUSTUDY is contained in:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the Operation of the Student Assistance Act 1992</EMPHASIS>;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the booklet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AUSTUDY Guide `93: A Guide to Student Finance.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of the Act provides for the review of decisions:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">at first instance, by a more senior within the Department;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the student is still dissatisfied, by the Student Assistance Tribunal; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the student is still dissatisfied, by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABSTUDY scheme</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABSTUDY scheme does not have a statutory basis. The authority for the scheme stems from a Cabinet decision and the annual approval by the Minister of guidelines. The guidelines set out the procedures and policy of the scheme. More information about ABSTUDY is contained in:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the 1993 ABSTUDY Policy Guidelines Manual; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the booklet <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABSTUDY 1993: Money to Study</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABSTUDY decisions are reviewable:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">at first instance, by a more senior officer than the officer who made the decision;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the person is still dissatisfied by the decision, by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that legislation be made for the ABSTUDY scheme during 1995. It is proposed to amend the Act in the Autumn Sittings in 1994 to authorise regulations to be made for ABSTUDY. ABSTUDY decisions would then be reviewable in exactly the same way as AUSTUDY decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY Supplement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AUSTUDY/ABSTUDY Supplement came into effect on 1 January 1993. The provisions relating to the Supplement are contained in Part 4A of the Act. The Supplement is a loan provided to students through the private sector under agreement with the Commonwealth Government. More information about the Supplement is contained in:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the Operation of the Act 1992</EMPHASIS> (a concise outline of the Supplement is given at p.2);and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Supplement 1993 Information Booklet: More Money to Study</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions in relation to the Supplement are reviewable:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the student qualified on the basis of his or her (actual or hypothetical) entitlement to AUSTUDY&mdash;in the same way as other AUSTUDY decisions; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the student qualified on the basis of his or her entitlement (actual or hypothetical) to ABSTUDY&mdash;in the same way as other ABSTUDY decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial discretions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Loosely also asked for details of discretions which may be exercised by the Minister. In relation to the AUSTUDY scheme, the Minister is given the following discretions under the Student Assistance Act:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to appoint prescribed officers for the purposes of the Act (section 4);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to make a determination as to the courses of study in respect of which benefits are payable (section 7);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to enter into an agreement with a financial corporation for the payment by the corporation of financial supplement to students (subsection 12D(1));</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to appoint and terminate the appointment of members of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal (sections 15 and 17) and to appoint a member of the Tribunal who is not a Convenor to act as a Convenor (section 19);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to determine that late payment interest is not to be payable in relation to particular periods (subsection 41(1)). Note that this discretion is also given to prescribed officers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to make a determination as to the guidelines to be complied with by the Minister or other persons in the exercise of powers under Part 6 of the Act (which relates to the recovery of overpayments) (section 44); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to delegate all or any of the Minister's powers under section 41 (to determine that late payment interest is not payable) or subsection 43(2) (to write off debts) to the Secretary or a Senior Executive Service officer (section 53).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister is not given any discretions under the AUSTUDY Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the ABSTUDY scheme, in a general sense the whole scheme (apart from matters relating to the recovery of overpayments) is subject to the Minister's discretion. The Minister may at any time make changes to ABSTUDY policy to remove anomalies or accommodate new circumstances. More specifically, under the Policy Guidelines, the Minister has the discretion to review decisions .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 6 of the Student Assistance Act relates to the recovery of overpayments for ABSTUDY in addition to AUSTUDY. Accordingly, the discretions given to the Minister in relation to Part 6 outlined above are also relevant to the ABSTUDY Scheme. These powers are,briefly:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to make a determination as to the guidelines for .he recovery of overpayments; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to delegate the Minister's powers under section 41 to the Secretary or an SES officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this information is of assistance. If you would like to arrange a meeting to discuss this matter further, please contact Ms Ruth Doobov, Assistant Secretary, Student Assistance Support Branch, on ph. 276 8217.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill amends the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 to implement the amendment announced by the government on 24 June 1992 to exclude from eligibility claimants with criminal convictions under the corporations law or in respect of serious fraud, and certain claimants under schemes of arrangement. The bill provides also for firms to claim  half yearly in the early stages of overseas marketing, and makes a number of `technical' amendments which protect the scheme's integrity and administrative efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payment of grants to persons with criminal convictions under the corporations law or in respect of serious fraud is currently possible under the scheme. It is considered that the integrity of the scheme is at risk where it allows convicted persons access to public funds. The bill does not prevent persons with minor convictions from obtaining grants, only those who have been convicted of more serious offences under the corporations law, or in respect of fraud. For example, a company director who failed to lodge a company return by the appointed time, is not excluded from the scheme. Whilst a criminal offence, this conviction, in isolation, does not assault the scheme;s integrity in any serious way, and this display of flexibility is seen as preserving the underlying open access nature of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, it is considered that payment of grants to  business operations with very low viability, and consequently low probability to any future benefit from export promotional expenditure, is not within the spirit of the scheme's intent. Although on occasions an insolvent claimant may eventually trade on to become a viable operation, this generally is not the case, and the legal and practical difficulties associated with assessing potential viability are considerable. Also, the scheme is essentially open access and does not attempt to determine this viability on the basis of value judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, half yearly claims lodgement is seen as a very practical method of assisting exporters'  cash flow in the early stages of overseas market development. The scheme has operated very successfully for nineteen years, with the only significant criticism being the delay between incurring expenditure by the exporter, and the payment of the grant.  This bill provides for earlier payment of grants based on the provision to lodge half yearly claims in respect of exporters' first three full grant years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A great strength of the scheme is the freedom it affords exporters to make judgements as to the activities they wish to pursue, and the markets they wish to target. This premise, and the need for containment of administrative cost, means that some delay in payment is inevitable. Half yearly claims lodgement, however, provides the framework which could double the frequency of payments without altering the essential parameters of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill implements also a number of `technical' amendments to the act. These amendments are essentially administrative and are required to clarify the established intention of the legislation, or assist with the tightening of ongoing risk management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA>The motion before the Senate seeks to have an inquiry conducted by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the validation of the care aggregated module, CAM, and the standard aggregated module, SAM, funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The validation of nursing home expenditure by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services appears to have considerable problems and has been criticised by all sectors of the nursing home industry. It is also currently the subject of an official inquiry by the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns that have been expressed by proprietors of nursing homes and their industry representatives about the conduct of validations are many and varied. Some of the more commonly expressed concerns include: the department validating nursing and personal care expenditure from before the commencement of the new CAM-SAM system in 1987; the purchasers of new nursing homes not being informed about negative loadings that are pending on nursing homes when they have inquired with the department; widely differing interpretations between departmental officers as to what constitutes nursing and personal care expenditure; the issuing of departmental circulars that amend the definition of nursing and personal care, and then applying these new interpretations retrospectively; significant miscalculations of negative loadings by validation teams; excessive tardiness by the department in validating nursing homes that are changing hands; excessively onerous requests by departmental officers for records and proof of expenditure from many years earlier, including when the home was under different ownership;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the fact that undue discretion is given to individual validators in the validators handbook; totally unrealistic interpretations of the everyday duties of DONs, including whether it is a nursing duty or not to take linen from a linen cupboard down to a resident's room, or to take a resident's nightdress from the bed to the laundry, instances of which, I feel, really need to be looked at;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the validation guidelines ignoring the fact that tax has already been paid on the money that is being recouped; and, possibly most disturbingly, the Australian Federal Police entering nursing homes for what would sometimes appear to be no apparent valid reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give the Senate an idea of the department's tardiness in validating nursing and personal care expenditure, the new funding arrangements to which the validations supposedly apply commenced in 1987. The department now believes that it will be able to complete validating the first year's operation of the new funding arrangements by mid-1994. Certainly, I do not know of any serious business that would consider it appropriate to audit its books up to seven years after the money has been spent. But departmental officers will spend weeks, sometimes months, sifting through nursing home records, using nursing home resources at the same time, often to find a single, relatively minuscule record from up to six years previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be recognised that the federal government has estimated that it will realise some $96 million from these validations. As there are about 1,200 nursing homes being validated, this amounts to an average of $80,000 in negative loadings per home. At a time when nursing home margins have been significantly reduced as a result of an inflexible funding system and excessive bureaucratic interference and documentation, many proprietors are rightly worried that an inappropriately or unexpectedly harsh assessment by a validation team may send them to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are claims that only one nursing home peak body and a small number of nursing homes are concerned about validations. I contend that the size of the savings estimates alone demands that these validations be conducted in a fair and professional manner. The Commonwealth Ombudsman has, I believe, received at least 13 individual complaints relating to validations. This is not an insignificant number of complaints about a single issue. However, it must be remembered that the results of any investigation by the ombudsman are not publicly available and in no way can such an investigation be reasonable considered to be an alternative to a public inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want it to be known that the coalition does not for one minute condone the  misapplication of government funding by nursing home proprietors. I am the first to recognise that some nursing homes have not spent moneys they have received from the Commonwealth in a way that is in line with the relevant funding principles. The coalition is not questioning the appropriateness of conducting validations of public funding of nursing homes. However, every nursing home proprietor must have an undeniable right to a timely validation that is prospectively applied in accordance with a consistently defined and interpreted set of guidelines by validation teams acting in a professional manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From speaking with the investigating officer from the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office, it is apparent that he wishes to question the department about a significant number of matters relating to nursing home validations. From speaking to both the voluntary and the private sectors of the nursing home industry, it is quite obvious that the concerns about the validation process are real and widespread. After reading a significant amount of correspondence between proprietors, their representatives and the department, it is obvious that this issue is in urgent need of a thorough and open public examination for the good of all parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate to support the motion to send the matter of nursing home validations to the standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited represents another important step in the Government's micro-economic reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporation was formed in 1970 to build and capitalise on the engineering expertise which had been acquired from all over the world during the construction of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. At the same time, the formation of SMEC reduced the need to use foreign consultants in Australia and provided a source of income through the opening of overseas markets for Australian consultants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 1 July 1989 the Corporation reached another important milestone when it was converted into a full public company. Since then, SMEC has conducted itself in the same manner as any other private sector company. This has included the benefits of full operational autonomy and also taking on the responsibility for debts and liabilities associated with its operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout its distinguished history SMEC has `DONE US PROUD'. It is highly regarded overseas and has built up an enviable reputation for engineering consulting through completing some 1700 projects in 55 countries. It has now grown into a consulting organisation of international standing in civil, electrical and mechanical engineering.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But everything has its time and place and while it once may have been appropriate for the Australian Government to foster the development of engineering consulting skills through ownership of a consultancy company this is now no longer the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rapid development of the Australian consulting engineering industry over the past 25 years and its internationally recognised capability has meant that there is now no reason to maintain SMEC in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although for the first 10 years of operations SMEC enjoyed financial success, in the early 1980's it was severely affected by the downturn in the international engineering consulting industry. After five years of losses SMEC returned to profit in 1987 but its performance was at best still only marginal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the year ending 30 June 1992, after significant restructuring and refocussing of its marketing efforts, it turned the corner and returned a pre-tax profit of more than $1 million before abnormals. Because of redundancies and other abnormals, SMEC's consolidated after tax result was a profit of $314,000. In the year ending 30 June 1993 SMEC's consolidated after tax result is expected to improve further to a healthy profit of more than $1 million. On behalf of the Government I wish to extend my congratulations to the Board, management and staff of SMEC for this excellent result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A pre-sale scoping study undertaken for the Task Force on Asset Sales by Arthur Andersen indicates that SMEC's consultancy business is well placed to continue to prosper and return profits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with any service organisation, SMEC's resources are its skilled staff and the recent and future success of the organisation rests with those staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has accordingly given first preference to staff to purchase the company. They made it what it is today, they built it up, they returned it to profit and the Government believes that SMEC's staff should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of its success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's intention to sell SMEC to Tinbury Limited, a company formed by SMEC staff specifically for the purpose of purchasing SMEC, provided that Tinbury pays a fair price and demonstrates it has the wherewithal to give SMEC a sustainable and viable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is ensuring that a sales agreement with Tinbury addresses issues relevant to the staff of SMEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tinbury Limited will maintain the headquarters of SMEC in Cooma and not sell SMEC for a period of at least five years, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all SMEC staff will have a further opportunity to purchase shares in Tinbury Limited before a sale is completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the staff and key managers of SMEC have a much greater knowledge of the company than the Commonwealth as shareholder, the Government is offering no warranties to Tinbury Limited post-sale except as to matters of corporate structure, ownership, title and the power to transfer them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government as shareholder has no legal liability for SMEC's debts and this position is, of course, unchanged by the sale of the Government's shareholding. Other than in respect of proper payment of pre-sale Australian taxation, there is and will be no Government indemnity to SMEC of any kind post-sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in recognition of the possible contingent liability in respect of a 1990 incident at the Dartmouth Dam power station, which is noted in SMEC's Annual Report, the Government is providing a limited "Money Back Guarantee" to Tinbury. This means that in the unfortunate event that SMEC were to be forced into liquidation as a result of the Dartmouth litigation, Tinbury would get a refund of the money it had paid up-front to the Commonwealth from Tinbury's share capital or borrowings as part of the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill now before the Senate contains the legislative changes that need to be made to enable the sale of SMEC to be finalised while taking into account a range of possible sale outcomes. This is to cover the possibility that an agreement with Tinbury which is acceptable to the Government does not eventuate or a sale to Tinbury is not completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the Bill is concerned with the removal of SMEC from the ambit of Commonwealth legislation so that post-sale SMEC will face the same treatment as any other engineering consulting organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period of SMEC's financial downturn it accumulated taxation losses. These losses are of value to a potential purchaser because they could reduce tax paid to the Commonwealth on future SMEC profits. In order to reduce the initial cash cost of purchasing SMEC, should it be sold to staff the Bill contains a provision for the extinguishing of these losses. This means that future SMEC profits for the financial year in which the sale occurs onwards, will be fully taxable as if no past losses had been made. These taxation provisions will be proclaimed only if forming an essential part of the purchase price agreed in a sale contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President. The Government's primary aim in the sale of its shares in SMEC is that employees continue to have secure and rewarding jobs and earn foreign exchange for Australia as SMEC increases its international success, particularly in the dynamic Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also committed to the protection up to point of sale of SMEC employees' entitlements which accrued during the period of Government ownership, especially in cases where these entitlements accrued as a result of Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the Bill provides for a number of "saving" provisions in respect of a variety of acts, such as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. These provisions are similar to those in the Qantas Sale Act and will ensure that employees of SMEC do not lose the benefits that they will have accrued prior to sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rights under the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act will continue to apply to those employees who commence leave within 12 months of a sale or are on leave at the time of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulations will be separately introduced under the Superannuation Act 1976 to ensure that employees of SMEC who are currently members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme do not lose the superannuation benefits that they will have accrued under this scheme prior to the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, other rights not conferred by Commonwealth legislation will not be affected by the sale as the Government is selling its shares in SMEC and the SMEC Award with its current conditions will continue post-sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As soon as possible after a sales agreement is finalised, a date for sale completion will be set on which SMEC is to be freed from all legislative constraints which apply generally to Commonwealth Business Enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also contains a provision exempting the transaction from state and territory taxes as well as other saving and transitional provisions relating to other Commonwealth Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill puts in place a sound legislative framework to enable the sale of SMEC to be completed once an acceptable sales agreement has been struck, it will free SMEC from Commonwealth constraints other than those of a normal company and allow SMEC to take charge of its own growth and destiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)disallows the Declaration by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion is similar to a motion dealt with the day before yesterday in relation to a declaration made by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) with respect to religious freedoms. As with that matter, this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General under section 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, but on this occasion with respect to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The effect of the Attorney's declaration was to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in that UN convention within the definition of human rights for the purposes of that act, often referred to as the HREOC act, that is, the purposes and general functions of the commission with respect to human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very first point I want to make in relation to this matter is that the coalition is not opposed to the convention itself; the coalition has never been opposed to the convention itself. Should there be any doubt about that matter, I invite honourable senators to look at the speech in the House of Representatives by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) on 21 February 1991, not long after the ratification of that convention by Australia. In that speech it was made perfectly clear that the coalition, were it in government, would have ratified the convention. But&mdash;and I suppose there is often a but&mdash;it would have done so with reservations to particular articles of the convention so as to make Australia's interpretation of that convention crystal clear. The coalition saw that as being a very important step. It would have ratified the convention, but it would have done so with reservations to make the interpretation of particular articles of the convention crystal clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in considering this motion, it is important to understand that the coalition is not in fact attacking the convention. What we are doing is questioning its incorporation into the HREOC act in light of the fact that Australia ratified the convention without any of the reservations we would have made had we been in government. They were reservations with respect to its interpretation. A second point that needs to be made is that, in raising this matter and seeking to have the Attorney's declaration disallowed, the coalition is not criticising the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the background of this matter, the origins of the convention can be traced back to the declaration of Geneva on the rights of the child, which was adopted by the League of Nations back in 1924. That was in response to the needs of children after World War I. The declaration contained five principles. They were very general but, nonetheless, concise. For example, one of them was that children should be the first to receive relief in any emergency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations adopted its own Declaration on the Rights of the Child in 1959, and that outlines 10 principles to guide parents, governments and voluntary organisations in their treatment of children. These principles include non-discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion or political opinion; enjoyment of special treatment under the law; entitlement to a name and nationality at birth; enjoyment of social security benefits; provision of education; and protection against neglect, cruelty and exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979, 20 years later, the United Nations Human Rights Committee commenced drafting a convention to deal with children's rights. The resulting Convention on the Rights of the Child was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989&mdash;10 years on again. That is, some 30 years after the United Nations adopted a declaration with respect to the matter, it was able to unanimously adopt a convention. It came into force internationally upon receiving its 20th ratification on 2 September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to Australia ratifying that convention, there was much concern about the potential effect of the convention on family life in this nation. There was at the time very particular concern as to whether it would undermine parental rights and responsibilities, particularly as they related to education, religion, association with others and privacy. The articles in the convention that are relevant to these issues&mdash;articles 12 to 16 inclusive and article 28&mdash;contain no express recognition of the primary rights and responsibilities of parents, and therefore appear to give absolute rights to the child. The Holy See, when it ratified the convention, made a reservation to the effect that it would interpret the articles of the convention in a way that would safeguard the primary and inalienable rights of parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in November 1990, prior to the ratification of the convention by Australia, the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, made reference to the reservations to the convention which were made by the Holy See. He advised the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the Australian Government ratifies the convention, should it do so, one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. It would be surprising were that not the case . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Despite that statement, in December 1990&mdash;a little over a month later&mdash;the government ratified the convention without making any such reservations. The ratification took place at the time when there was a motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, moved by the honourable member for Kooyong, Andrew Peacock, calling on the government to give an undertaking that, in the event of the convention being ratified by Australia, reservations would be lodged to protect those inalienable rights of parents. But the government, in ratifying the treaty prior to that motion being debated, ensured that there was no discussion of the convention in the House of Representatives prior to its ratification. In other words, there was simply a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns have bubbled up again as a consequence of the Attorney's incorporation of the convention into the HREOC act. Again prior to the ratification of the convention by Australia, Senator Evans responded to the concerns by simply dismissing them as `lunatic misapprehensions'. That did not do anything to set at rest the minds of those people who were concerned, and seems somewhat inconsistent with the remarks made by former Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one concession to those concerns in the lower house, in references by government representatives to the preamble and article 5 of the convention and to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which sets out rules for the interpretation of international treaties. That preamble contains a general statement about the family, stating that, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and wellbeing of all its members, particularly children, it should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 5 of the convention states that parties to the convention shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or persons legally responsible for the child to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the convention. However, those provisions fall short of providing the clear-cut interpretation of the convention that an express reservation as to the rights of parents, as has been done by the Holy See, would have provided. What appear to be the absolute rights of children, set out in articles 12 to 16 and 28, are arguably not sufficiently qualified by the vague reference to the family in the preamble; nor are they by article 5, which recognises the rights of parents to guide their children in the exercise of the rights recognised under the convention but does not, in its terms, qualify the rights themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawyers specialising in international law in the Attorney-General's Department may be aware of, and have access to, the Vienna convention, but the average person in the street does not. The simple fact is that people in the community who will be looking at the convention and wanting to interpret it, such as social workers and perhaps law enforcement officers and parents, are likely never to have heard of the Vienna convention, much less have the skills required to interpret it and apply it to the Convention on the Rights of the Child as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the ratification, Australia is now bound at international law by the terms of this convention. The convention obliges Australia to respect and ensure the rights recognised in the convention and to do so without discrimination of any kind. In particular, article 4 requires that states `undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative, and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognised'. Of course, the rights of children are already legislated for in Australia. Unlike the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the subject matter of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is the subject of quite wide ranging legislation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1989 a paper prepared by a working group on behalf of the Australian Council of Social Service indicated that existing government law and policies appeared generally consistent with the articles of the convention. It pointed out that, because there was no specification of what is meant by terms such as `social security', nor any detailing of other requirements, it was difficult to determine clearly the question of compliance in relation to some issues. In November 1989 Justice Elizabeth Evatt of the Law Reform Commission indicated that, in order to bring Australian laws into basic conformity with the convention, it might be necessary for legislative action to be taken in a wide range of areas, including family law, marriage, children's legal services, social security, and adoption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite those observations, because of the generality and the failure to be specific, the report by the Australian Council of Social Service indicated that it was difficult to determine clearly the question of compliance. Despite the fact that Justice Evatt indicated that it might be necessary for legislative action to be taken in a wide range of areas&mdash;despite those observations&mdash;the ratification of the convention went ahead without the passage of enabling legislation either at the state or territory level, or at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Durack put a question on 22 November 1989 as to whether or not the government had examined state child welfare laws in relation to many of the matters covered by the convention and, as a consequence of such an examination, made any judgment about their adequacy properly to protect the rights of Australian children, Senator Evans, the minister responsible for foreign affairs, said that the government had made a judgment that no Australian law was in contravention of the provisions of the convention. So we have ACOSS saying it is difficult to say; we have Justice Elizabeth Evatt saying some of the laws will have to be changed; and we have the minister responsible for foreign affairs saying the government did not think anything had to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of announcing the ratification of the convention, Senator Evans and the Attorney-General confidently said that state and territory laws already enabled Australia to meet all the obligations the convention would impose, with one exception, which was the subject of a reservation. That exception related to child and adult criminal offenders being in separate prisons. Nonetheless, those remarks obviously did not convince either the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission or the Australian Council of Social Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, they engaged the Public Interest Advocacy Centre to conduct a six-months wide-ranging review into the implications of the convention for Australian law and practice relating to children. As I understand it, that review is yet to be finalised. It has been put on the backburner at the moment, reflecting the difficulties involved in actually interpreting the convention or in trying to apply it to see whether Australian law complies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has therefore bound Australia to a convention while it is still unclear whether Australian laws comply with it, and it is unclear therefore what legislative changes are needed to enable Australia to comply with it at Commonwealth, state and territory levels. These issues, the coalition says, should have been resolved before ratification. No-one argues with the general objectives of the UN convention, that is, to prevent the exploitation of children and to ensure that their rights are recognised. The convention is directed towards preventing dreadful practices such as child prostitution and slavery and towards ensuring that there is proper representation of children in legal proceedings and a number of other very desirable objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, given the lack of clarity of the terms of the convention and the acknowledged difficulties in interpreting it, given the government's failure to make an express reservation at the time of ratification that would have clarified the meaning of crucial articles of the convention, and given the widespread concern this has generated in the community, its wholesale incorporation into the HREOC act is undesirable. As with the UN religious declaration, the incorporation of the convention under the HREOC act also illustrates the unsatisfactory structure of the HREOC act, to which reference was made on 28 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functions of the commission are set out in section 11 of that act. They include the examination of all relevant international instruments in order to ascertain whether there are any inconsistencies between any of them and any other international instruments already incorporated into the definition of a human rights act. Relevant international instruments are defined to be those declared under section 47. That is the type of declaration the Attorney has made that we are now seeking to have disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so declaring an instrument under the act, it also brings the rights and freedoms recognised in the instrument within the other functions of the commission. Those functions include inquiring into any act or practice of the Commonwealth or its agencies which might be contrary to the rights or freedoms recognised in the instrument; promoting an understanding and acceptance of those rights within Australia; and reporting to the minister as to what laws should be made by the Commonwealth or what action should be taken by the Commonwealth in relation to those rights. Therefore, by declaring an instrument under the HREOC act, the commission is given the function of promoting rights and freedoms which, it is agreed by many, may, and on the coalition's analysis almost certainly do, conflict with rights in other instruments already under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anomaly is that the act creates a situation where the commission does not have the power to examine an international instrument to see whether it is inconsistent with an instrument already incorporated in the act unless the commission is put in the position of having to promote both instruments. Given the uncertainty that presently exists as to whether Australian laws are in compliance with the convention, the commission may therefore be obliged to promote rights and freedoms recognised in the convention which are, in fact, inconsistent with existing Australian laws. I cannot understand how anyone could not agree that that is a ludicrous situation to put the commission in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as with the United Nations religious declaration, many submissions have been received by the coalition in relation to this convention, and many of those submissions have revealed a very serious lack of understanding among hundreds of members of the public about the impact of Australia ratifying UN conventions and a lack of understanding of the means by which they become part of our domestic law, the roles and powers of the commission itself and the effect of declaring international instruments under the HREOC act. The government, despite its protestations of being interested in human rights and despite some of the good work it has done, has simply failed to educate and inform the community about how the convention will impact on family life in Australia and is therefore responsible for causing quite deep and widespread concern throughout the community. The government should have taken on that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial declaration under the HREOC act therefore should be disallowed under this motion. But, just as I indicated several days ago in relation to the declaration with respect to religious freedoms, there are some things the government should now do that it should have done years ago. First, it should review the convention and ascertain whether Australian laws&mdash;Commonwealth, state and territory&mdash;are consistent with its provisions when correctly interpreted. Second, it should enact any legislation pursuant to that review and request the states or territories to do the same. Third, the Attorney should give careful consideration to whether, in light of the relevant legislation, any declaration under the HREOC act was necessary. If the prior steps are appropriately implemented, then we should be able to conclude whether or not the declaration the Attorney has made is necessary or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, what the coalition is asking the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine to do is to join with us and disallow the Attorney's declaration and to set the Attorney on the path of reviewing the convention and ascertaining and reporting back to parliament as to the degree of compliance with the convention under Commonwealth, state and territory laws, the extent to which legislation can be enacted pursuant to that review, and how quickly that can be done. With that information at hand, then this chamber could decide whether it was appropriate to make the declaration under the HREOC act or not. Without that information at hand, without the government having done that job, it is simply unacceptable to allow the Attorney's declaration to put the Convention on the Rights of the Child under the HREOC act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and in opposition to the position taken by the Liberal and National parties in this place on this issue. What we are talking about is an international instrument which has as its primary objective the protection and the rights of children. It is an instrument which does not, in the way that it has been adopted by the government, take instant effect as domestic law in this country. It is an instrument which will, because of its application, provide the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission with a role in protecting the rights of children&mdash;an educational role and a safeguarding role. It will not have any power to incarcerate a person because that person does not agree with the convention but it will have a role to ensure that the public are educated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other role of the convention will be to ensure that Commonwealth practices are in conformity with the convention. We do not talk about this convention as something that does not have any real, meaningful, direct relevance. We talk of it as having direct and important relevance, not just domestically within Australia but also internationally. I think the honourable member for Boothby (Mr Hall) in the House of Representatives made the point that in Australia in 1991 we had some 21,000 established cases of abuse of children. That figure itself reflects the fact that legislators in this country are not doing enough to protect children. That fact itself indicates the direct relevance of this convention, a role for HREOC and a responsibility on all legislatures, but particularly this one, to take a further interest in the rights of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does it have that sort of role domestically but the convention is an important international instrument. It is important in that it targets the malpractices being perpetrated on children. Children are being sold; male and female children are being used for prostitution from the age of 12 or 13; children are being deliberately maimed; and so on. The world has set an international benchmark for the treatment of children, and it is important for Australia to be part of that. We were part of it in its formulation. It is important for us to continue to be part of it now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that effect, the Australian government has already taken measures to gauge the compliance of governments in this country with these benchmarks that even the opposition accepts. Both in this place and in the other place, there is an acknowledgment by opposition members that they do not oppose the instrument that we are talking about. To the extent that we as a government are operating, we have set seven major goals of an action plan against which we will check our obligations to this instrument. Those seven major goals are important and they are probably worth enunciating right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the reduction of infant and under five years of age mortality rates; the reduction of maternal mortality rates; the reduction of severe and moderate malnutrition of children under five years of age; universal access to safe drinking water; sanitary means of excreta disposal; reduction of the adult illiteracy rate, with emphasis on female literacy; and improved protection of children in especially difficult circumstances. They are all honourable goals, goals with which opposition members agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that, once again, when it comes to actually putting their hands up on an issue of social importance, an issue of social reform, opposition members are being led from behind. Senator Hill, who has been leader in this place for a number of years, has once again abdicated his role of leadership. Dr Hewson, the leader in the other place, has also abdicated his role. They are allowing the wild backbench&mdash;the feral backbench&mdash;of the opposition to take over once again. They are abdicating responsibility in such a way that the public will very soon become aware that we have an opposition whose members not only are prepared not to make difficult decisions on policy on the economic front but will go to the next election, as they went to the last one, without a socially relevant policy; without a policy to cater for the social problems of this country; without a policy to cater for the needs of children, the needs of women, the needs of families and the needs of migrant groups&mdash;and this is another instance of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members come in here and go into the other place&mdash;and, I must admit, some of them who make these points are people with some intelligence&mdash;and try to weasel their way out of this instrument. They try to weasel their way out of support for an instrument which has overwhelming support in this country and has overwhelming support internationally. As I said yesterday, they do not come in here with any solid arguments, any rational arguments; they come in here with spurious rhetoric, with fabricated points of view, but none of them are relevant to the people of this nation or to people internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They say that there needs to be a reservation to the instrument. The first line they advance is their claim that Senator Tate, when questioned about this matter some time ago in the Senate, gave an undertaking that there would be a reservation and that that reservation has not been made. The quote they use from Senator Tate is a deliberately misleading one and it does them no good to pursue it. They say that Senator Tate said in the parliament in respect of a reservation, `It would be surprising were that not the case', implying there was a full stop at that particular point. But Senator Tate went on to say a couple of important sentences. I will quote his remarks so as to give the full meaning of what he said. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be surprising were that not the case, given the fact that Australia inserted article 5, meaning that for the first time in the international community a document was open to ratification which recognised that pre-eminent role of the family, parents or legal guardians in giving guidance and direction to children in accordance with their evolving capacities.</PARA>
<PARA>That concern about the pre-eminent role of the family in giving guidance to children was responded to by Senator Tate. In the quote that was half repeated in this place and in the House of Representatives, he went on to say that concern `has been acknowledged by article 5'. Article 5 is an article that Australia had a major role in inserting in the instrument. It is there because Australia pursued it. That gives the lie to the point that they were making about a need for a reservation to protect the rights of families in terms of their guidance over children. Australia has already acted. It does them no good&mdash;and it does this institution no good&mdash;to come in here and half quote and deliberately misquote my former colleague Senator Tate. We have acted in the protection of the rights of families. That is there. It is there in article 5 of this instrument; it is there because of Australia's action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members then say that the other point is that we need to take the same position as the Holy See in respect to this. They claim the Holy See made a reservation in respect to this instrument to protect the rights of the family over such matters as religion, education and so on. If one were actually to read the Holy See's so-called reservation, one would probably see it as a declaration interpreting the way the Holy See would read article 5 of this instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Holy See, I think quite fairly and quite rationally, can be seen to be taking that position, but let us have a look at article 5 in a general sense. Let us have a look at this instrument in a general sense. No other country around the world has made a reservation to this convention. No other country has made the sort of reservation that we are talking about. Other countries have not tried to weasel their way out of their commitments, their obligations both to our children in this country and children internationally. The countries include the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. This is probably one of the most heavily ratified instruments internationally that the world has seen. But no, standing alone, in isolation, back in the backblocks somewhere are the National and Liberal parties in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Come on, for God's sake, in the interests of the children of this country and of the world, can the honourable senators opposite just drop their ideological objection to some of these things and actually view them rationally&mdash;view them with some degree of decency and commonsense. It is no wonder the people of Australia have said to them that they have got no social policy, no social relevance. Time and time again, they are coming in here and showing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this is one of the most heavily ratified international conventions, and there is one declaration&mdash;not reservation&mdash;from the Holy See. Opposition senators come in here wanting to weasel their way out of an obligation imposed on government to act in the interest of children, an obligation imposed on the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to publicise and to promote the interests of children. It is an obligation internationally to protect children from prostitution, from malnutrition, from illiteracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No, it is only the opposition side in this place which is standing alone against the rest of the world. When I say that the Opposition side is standing against the rest of the world, I should point out it is not just a case of over 147 countries having ratified the convention. Even in our own country we should look at what has been said by the National Child-Youth Law Council, the Australian Federation of Children, the Family Welfare Association, HREOC and, not surprisingly in this case, the Law Council of Australia.

Letters seeking assistance and attaching a questionnaire were sent out at the start of 1992. The last response was received in June 1993, and a draft report was circulated in May to relevant Commonwealth departments and state and territory governments for comment. Not all have responded to this date, but we hope to lodge Australia's first report by the end of the year. In the context of the report, we are finding particular problems.

Of those 49 heads of government, governments such as those of the UK, Canada and New Zealand had ratified the treaty previously.

These nascent principles were developed further when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration of the Rights of the Child in 1959. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Convention on the Rights of the Child was first proposed by the Polish government during the International Year of the Child in 1979. The United Nations took up the negotiations with religious organisations, charitable institutions and human rights groups to forge an international treaty guaranteeing children the right to an adequate level of care, shelter and education and protection from exploitation and abuse. The convention was finally adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1989 and was ratified in Australia on 17 December 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the declaration, this convention is a legal instrument with which Australia is bound by international law to comply. These rights cannot at present be enforced by the courts. However, should the incorporation of the convention into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act take place, children will be able to assert the rights recognised in the United Nations convention in courts of law. These children's rights become enforceable in the court. The associated complications that could result from this are sobering and could have far-reaching ramifications for Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Convention on the Rights of the Child comprises 54 articles which address broad principles to promote and protect the fundamental rights of children. These principles include the right to life, name, nationality and culture; freedom of thought, conscience and religion; adequate standard of living; access to health services and education; protection from forced separation from parents; protection from abuse and neglect; protection from economic exploitation; and protection from sexual exploitation and abuse, capital punishment and deprivation of liberty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again I say that these rights already apply in Australia, and again I say that I am not opposed to the principles of the convention. The intention to prevent the exploitation and abuse of children and safeguard their basic rights is commendable. The provisions, particularly those contained within articles 32 to 37 dealing with children's rights to protection from physical and mental violence, economic exploitation, drug abuse, sexual exploitation and abuse, torture, capital punishment and deprivation of liberty, merit our utmost support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the provisions laid out in articles 12 to 16 do concern me. They deal with the rights of children to express opinions; freedom of expression and information; freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom of association; and protection of privacy, honour and reputation. None of these provisions address the interlocking rights and duties of parents to advise and guide their children as they see fit. It can be summarised from these provisions that the children are endowed with absolute rights in regard to expressions of thought and opinion, access to information and association with whomever they choose, and these are completely independent of the parental mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this becomes law in Australia, who will interpret that? Again we do not know. It will not be the laws of this parliament. It will be some human rights commissioner or some court that sets itself up in Geneva. The people of Australia want these decisions to be made by the legislatures of Australia and this is why there is such concern about United Nations conventions usurping the rights of the parliaments of Australia. What starts out as a good idea at the time ends up with all sorts of unintended consequences. We have seen this in a number of areas in Australia, with children as young as 15 and 16 given the right, the money and the financial support to move away from their families, to go out on the streets. No-one disagrees with the principles that are expounded under the conventions, but the interpretation sometimes does not come up to the expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble in article 5 of the convention covers parental rights. The preamble states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance . . . within the community.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 5 states that all states are to respect the rights of parents or other persons responsible for the child to give the child direction and guidance, consistent with his or her evolving capacities, in the exercise of the child's rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These rights should have been included with the rights of children in articles 12 to 16. If they were, I believe, we would not have the reservations that we are expressing at the moment. The family unit and children's rights co-exist with those of their parents, but this section of the convention does not acknowledge this fundamental family nexus. This has given rise to the fear shared by thousands of parents that their rights and duties in regard to their children's upbringing have been undermined, or could be undermined, with this further encroachment by the state into their family lives. Those fears, I believe, are genuine; and they are coming from thousands of people from whom we have received phone calls and letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family is the basic unit of our society. In fact, that is one of the very strongest planks of the National Party. A solid family unit is the imperative base for a society to grow and prosper, and any move to diminish the rights of the family should be met with resistance. Families are under enough pressure at the moment from economic conditions and declining living standards, with one million unemployed: there are 700,000 children growing up in households where no-one has a job. Over the last 10 years there has been a steep increase in family break-ups, unemployment, youth homelessness and crime; and this has placed tremendous stress and strain on families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evoking a United Nations convention is not going to do one thing for those people that are going through so much stress at the moment. That is where we are coming from. What is this all about? There is so much pressure on the family today. So many children cannot get jobs. So many parents are stressed out because their children cannot get jobs and they see their years of economic sacrifice in putting their children through high school and college, and then through tertiary education, all going to nothing when the children go out there to try to achieve a job and find themselves bottled up in some sort of mickey mouse job program that does not lead anywhere or is of only six months duration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this government should be trying to fix up and adjust, if it really supports the family. This is just a cop-out, saying, `We really support the family and therefore we will support some United Nations convention'. The last thing that Australian families need is more pressure on them through the rights and responsibilities of parents being cast into doubt with the incorporation of vaguely worded United Nations conventions into domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before ratifying the convention in 1990, the government should have included the essential reservations which would have left no doubt whatsoever about the rights and responsibilities of parents in the family unit. Then the government would have had our support. In the same way, the Holy See would not ratify the convention until the reservations affirming the rights of all parents were included. If the government had made those reservations, it would have allayed the fears of the Catholic church and a number of other mainstream churches and of people that hold their families up as their life and the main things in their life&mdash;and probably the only things in their life. But it has not done that; and then it comes to this parliament and says that we are not facing our responsibilities. We are not elected by 149 other countries or however many other countries Senator Bolkus cited. We are elected by the people of Australia, and our main responsibility is to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reservation stated that the Holy See interprets the articles of the convention in a way that safeguards the primary and inalienable rights of parents, in particular insofar as these rights concern education, religion, association with others and privacy. Australia would follow that path had these reservations been moved by the government. They had been foreshadowed by former Senator Tate, who was then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs and who stated, just prior to signing, that he anticipated that the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. It never was acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when the time came, the government failed to put forward any such reservations, obviously believing that the insertion of article 5 would be sufficient. But it did not satisfy Senator Tate. He is not here to defend those actions. I suppose he is glad that he is not, because he would have been totally embarrassed. Those reservations clearly have not been put forward. The level of community concern over the possible erosion of parental rights and family life attests to that failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am opposed to the convention for another reason, which has not yet received any debate. As shadow minister for northern Australia and the external territories, I have grave fears about the real possibility of intrusion into the lives of communities such as those of Cocos Island, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission which, under the act, has the power to inquire into acts or practices engaged in by or on behalf of the Commonwealth. It impacts differently on the lives of people in the islands and the territories. It has more power. It can actually involve itself in the everyday lives of those communities. So we have created two classes of people&mdash;one in Australia, including the people of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, where the act can be invoked only in relation to the Commonwealth or states, and the other in the territories, where it goes a lot further and can inquire into the lives of all the territorians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This convention has the potential to be used against the residents of Cocos Island, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island, who are more vulnerable to the act than are Australian citizens. The possible ramifications of this have not been clearly thought through. If it had been possible to move an amendment, we would have done so, but that is not allowed in respect of the disallowance motion that has been moved in the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not opposed to the underlying objectives of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Its intention to promote the basic rights and freedoms of children as well as to guarantee protection from abuse, exploitation and neglect cannot be faulted. But we cannot be asked to support poorly drafted documents and things that are not clear and are ambiguous, which could have a destabilising effect in their application and which might work against families. The convention should never have been ratified without the inclusion of the reservations emphasising the rights and responsibilities of parents. It should certainly not now be passed into law. For those reasons, I support Senator Vanstone's disallowance motion, as do all National and Liberal party senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that everybody supports the thrust of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and properly so. Senator Boswell, in his usual magnificent contribution, made that point. It was also made right at the start of this debate in the parliament by the honourable member for Tangney, Mr Williams, who is the shadow Attorney-General, when he moved a motion of disallowance in the House of Representatives on 1 September 1993. He said in the course of his speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one should argue with the general objectives of the UN convention, namely, to prevent the exploitation of children and to ensure their rights are recognised. The convention is directed towards preventing such dreadful practices as child prostitution and slavery and towards ensuring adequate representation of children in legal proceedings and for other desirable objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is no objection to the content of the convention, to the general thrust of what it is about. The objections are referred to in the next paragraph. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, given the lack of clarity of the terms of the convention and the acknowledged difficulties in interpreting it, given the government's failure to make an express reservation at the time of ratification that would have clarified the meaning of crucial articles of the convention, and given the widespread concern that this has generated in the community, its wholesale incorporation into the HREOC Act is highly undesirable. As with the UN religious declaration, the incorporation of the convention under the HREOC Act also illustrates the unsatisfactory structure of the HREOC Act alluded to earlier this evening.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, if this law is to become applicable in Australia so that it actually touches the citizens of Australia in a way that other laws that are made here do, it will have to become part of the domestic law. The legislation for that will then be subject to interpretation by the courts, and that is a thing courts do every day. That is the very idea of having courts. So to say the legislation is unclear is a reasonable point, but not a point that should lead to the acknowledged good that is contained in this convention being stopped from being bought into domestic law. I think there is a feeling amongst some of us that there is not a need to have laws to protect children and, if that is the approach taken, it is quite misconceived. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What my church says about children and their protection is that they ought to be protected. In any event, the convention either stands or falls in its own terms. As people keep repeating, there is no objection to the convention except for the reservation, and except for the way it is to be carried out. There is much good fortune in this debate coming on now, because this is a very big issue at the moment in Victoria following the report of Mr Justice Fogarty. Mr Justice Fogarty has come in for considerable criticism, but may I say that he is a person who has had a most distinguished record in the law, both as a barrister and a member of Her Majesty's Counsel and then as a judge in the Family Court at first instance and as a judge on the appeal court of that body.

In this respect&mdash;and taking up the invitation from Senator Calvert about what my church might say&mdash;a spokesman for the Melbourne Catholic Social Services, Father Peter Norden, a man highly respected in my home state, said that the government, by pressing ahead with its cuts, would be abandoning the objectives of saving children's lives in favour of saving the dollar. The director of St Augustine's adolescent family services in Geelong, Brother Trevor Parton&mdash;also a member of my church, I remind Senator Calvert&mdash;said that the government's decision to cut its $780,000 funding by $400,000 would force it to close three or four residential care units for young people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What members of the opposition have done is to look at this convention and, having looked at it, they have found that they must support the general thrust of it. But then, as they do not want it to go through because, for whatever reason, they have got reservations about it, they have scanned it to find any sort of peg to hang a disallowance motion on. That is not a happy way of going about these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we should do when looking at legislation is to look at the general thrust, at the good that it will bring about, at the overall objectives it pursues, and to pass it on that basis rather than trying to find an excuse for rejecting it. When those opposite look for an excuse to reject it, people might well draw the conclusion that they are not rejecting it for that particular excuse, because they have found a blemish in it, but because they do not like the overall objectives. That is the difficulty they find themselves in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they reject it for one reason, the appearance is that they have rejected it holus-bolus, which they have done. If they reject it holus-bolus, as they must on a motion such as this, then they are rejecting a convention, as Mr Williams, the honourable member for Tangney, said in the other place, which prevents the exploitation of children, which ensures that their rights are recognised, which is directed towards preventing such dreadful practices as child prostitution and slavery, and which ensures adequate representation of children in legal proceedings and for other desirable objectives&mdash;and at a time when there is much adverse criticism of the way we treat children in this society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the discussion about the Fogarty report. There was discussion earlier about the juvenile justice legislation in Western Australia&mdash;which was passed by an Australian Labor Party government, that is conceded. There are concerns about the way children are treated in every state of this Commonwealth. Yet when there is some proposition brought forward in this House which, at the very least, goes against the culture that has produced that sort of abuse, it is rejected because of what could only be described as fairly technical reasons at best. After all, if this convention were finally put into domestic law, it would be interpreted by domestic courts. Even at this stage, when it goes into the HREOC legislation it is interpreted by the Federal Court, and there is an overall supervision of the way it is administered by the Federal Court and by the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rejection of this convention is a rejection of the proposition that our courts are courts of high quality, courts able to administer properly the law in this nation in the best interests of this nation. The more one looks at it, the more one wonders why the opposition wants so strongly to reject this report, given its application to the situation in Australia. We should be supporting it because it sets world standards, and children around the world obviously need protection and help. If we reject this, we are saying that we have got no interest in what happens to children around the world. That is understandable if a very parochial view is taken. But what is not understandable is that this particular convention has great relevance to Australia at the moment, because of the concern about the way children are treated. In the light of that concern and in the light of the overwhelming evidence that children do need protection and do need rights, when we, as a federal government, have an opportunity to do something about that, what do we do? We move to have it rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on this side of the House will not be taking that approach.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators might recall that earlier this year the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt, Mr Duffy&mdash;a man of great distinction in the law and in this parliament&mdash;made a declaration to incorporate the convention within the ambit of subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. The effect of this declaration was to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN convention within the definition of human rights for the purpose of the act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleagues have made abundantly clear, and will continue to make clear, the coalition is not opposed to the convention itself. Unfortunately, because of the processes of this Senate, we are not able to pick out those elements that we do have some concern about. It is unfortunate that the only avenue available to members of this opposition who have concerns about particular sections and subsections is to reject the whole of the declaration itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is indeed unfortunate, and can lead to the sorts of criticism that our colleague on the other side, Senator Cooney, has referred to. We are very much against child molestation, imprisonment, slavery and all those sorts of issues. But, as we have mentioned before, we have adequate processes and freedoms within this country that enable due process of these freedoms. What we are concerned about is that we are not extending the freedoms to Australians under this act. What frightens us is that we could be actually constrained. This is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we stress on the record that our current Liberal-National Party coalition has always supported the thrust of the convention, but&mdash;and I emphasise that&mdash;with reservations to particular articles in the convention, so that the terms and conditions and the rights contained therein would be made perfectly clear. This is where our concern is. There is a lot of ambiguity there and, as a result, confusion can arise. We do not want to make it more difficult. It is no reflection on the ability of the Australian courts in any way at all, but we believe it is unnecessary to add confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like the issues to be clarified so that there is not an element of doubt or confusion as to what parents' rights are or what children's rights are. For example, the coalition is concerned that the rights of parents as well as the rights of children are clear and do not need further interpretation. This is a problem, because they are not clear; they are fuzzy. The issue has caused a flood of correspondence and representations to my office in the form of personal visits, petitions and letters. That is not surprising; but the number of constituents who have contacted me on this issue would run into the hundreds&mdash;and for Tasmania those are great numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, as an elected representative of these people, I feel that it is my duty to outline to this chamber the sorts of concerns they are bringing to me almost on a daily basis. I think it is important that I use the opportunities afforded by this chamber to outline to the Senate some of the concerns of the people who come to me. I would like to feel that I am representing these people fairly, and so I give expression to their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the ambiguity of the wording of the Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it difficult for parents to know where they stand in the raising of their own child. There are difficulties particularly with articles 12 to 16 inclusive and article 28 of the convention, because they contain no express recognition of the primary rights and responsibilities of parents but, at the same time&mdash;this is where the confusion arises&mdash;they give absolute rights to the children. That is why I used the word `fuzzy' somewhat earlier in my presentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When articles 12 to 16 are examined, unfortunately further queries do arise. It is not a question of going through it and nitpicking. This is going to be a tremendous vehicle for lawyers to run on, because of the doubts. They thrive where the law is not precise or clear, and particularly in circumstances where it is ambiguous, so we want to try to remove those ambiguities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, it is unfortunate that we have no avenue for making these deletions or amendments and that we have to be seen to be rejecting the whole lot, even though the thrust of the convention is perfectly acceptable and, in many cases, it is absolutely necessary and fundamental. Many of my constituents feel that article 12 raises questions as to who should decide a child's fitness to form his or her own views on matters on conscience. Of course, it comes back to age&mdash;whether the child is a five-year-old, a 10-year-old or a 15-year-old. Does article 12 prepare the way to allow a teacher to implant and implement a view of thinking contrary to the parents' way of thinking? That is another problem. Are the parents prevented from voicing their concerns here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much debate can occur as to whether the interpretation is correct or not, but the very fact that this can be read into the convention declares that these matters do need clarification before they are allowed to become part of Australian law. I think it is incumbent on the Senate to make sure that our laws are precise, clear and free of fuzziness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question is the very funding of court costs that could occur when a child, by his own wish, is removed from his parents' care. Naturally, this causes a lot of concern. I have had representations from parents who were terribly distressed in relation to a particular case only about three weeks ago in Launceston. Article 12 seems to indicate to the many parents who have written to me that the child's court costs will be covered by the courts, while the parents must fund their own costs. Despite the fact that we are expressing some opposition, I think the responsibility is on the minister to answer clearly the sorts of questions I am posing which have come from my very concerned constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much comment has also been made with regard to article 13 of the convention, which gives the child the right to freedom of expression and to seek information from any source he chooses. The question is therefore raised by the parents: is this a blanket denial of the right of parents to raise a child in a manner which is consistent with their religious obligations as parents? That is fundamental. I refer to religious education. The Jesuits always said, `Give me a child for the first seven years and you can have him for the rest of his life'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The phrase `in the best interests of the child' also figures in the convention. In respect of this issue, one mother writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By making these articles into legally binding agreements it immediately means that each word and phrase is open to legal scrutiny and interpretation which may result in the letter of the law being upheld at the expense of the intended spirit.

As a parent my intention is always to act in the best interests of my children, but my opinion concerning that differs greatly, at times, even from other members of my own family, who also love my children and desire the best.</PARA>

I ask the minister whether his government will direct the courts in terms of its interpretation of acceptance of this convention and whether it will take the same approach as the Holy See. If so, some of the reservations and concerns of people such as the mother who wrote to me, I believe, should be satisfied in another way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is the intent? What is the purpose? I do not think that the minister can really back away by saying that he cannot direct the courts. It is true that he does not, but in his second reading speech, in the deliberations here today, in the speeches of people who will follow, an indication is needed because, when the courts look at these matters, they look at the second reading speeches to see what is the government's intent and purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right that has concerned my citizens the most, I suppose, is this reservation of the Holy See&mdash;the inalienable rights of the parents themselves. Within this UN convention, while there is an attempt to preserve the rights of children, the legislation is unevenly weighted against the parents in favour of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letters raise the query: are our current laws so inadequate in protecting and caring for our children? Is the quality of Australian parenting so poor that this parliament has to legislate to protect our children from their parents? We are not in India, where they discard baby girls. We are in a sophisticated democracy, with lots of rights guaranteed under our court system and by our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only references to the family and to the rights of parents by this government in the discussion leading to the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child were to the preamble, to article 5 of the convention and to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which sets out rules for the interpretation of international treaties. Unfortunately, this preamble gives a very fuzzy outline about the family. However, it is deficient in giving a clear and unambiguous interpretation of the convention, in that there is no implicit reservation or question about the rights of the parents. What appear to be the absolute rights of children set out in articles 12 to 16 and article 28 are arguably not sufficiently qualified by the vague reference to the family in the preamble, nor are they provided for by article 5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is unfortunate that we did not have Australian representatives on the body drafting the convention, because I am sure that the participation of our legal profession would have directed attention to the deficiencies by virtue of the vagueness of the language. Where are the rights of parents to guide their children in the exercise of the rights recognised under this article of the convention? Of course, it does not in its terms qualify the rights themselves. I therefore would like to refer to comments made by my colleague the shadow Attorney-General in the other place, the distinguished Mr Williams QC, when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the lack of clarity of the terms of the convention and the acknowledged difficulties in interpreting it, given the government's failure to make an express reservation at the time of ratification that would have clarified the meaning of crucial articles of the convention, and given the widespread concern that this has generated in the community, its wholesale incorporation into the HREOC act is highly undesirable.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is not too late for the government to make such a reservation, a reservation that the Holy See saw as necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government to take these issues on board and address the questions about the uncertainties I have raised so that I can go back to the hundreds of constituents who have written to me concerned about their rights and concerned about the future parenting of their children. I look forward hopefully to the fact that the government may see fit, in the light of the debate that has taken place, to place such a reservation there. It is not too late, but I think we do need some comfort and support from the government to allay the fears that have been raised by me and by my colleagues in this debate. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

This declaration would enable the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to promote the understanding and acceptance of the convention to inquire into, and report to the minister on, possible breaches of the convention. It is worth noting, even at this stage, that it has no power to take any other action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted Senator Cooney's generous comments in which he suggested that we should give some respect to the views that lie behind the moving of this motion of disallowance. I find it a little difficult to be quite as charitable. The ignorance, the distortion of readily available facts, or, at worst, the cynical pandering to extremist fundamentalists who I believe are using the coalition for their own ends is to my mind rather difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child does not automatically form part of Australian domestic law. This would require positive legislative action by the federal parliament or by the various state parliaments, and subsequent changes to the administrative practices of federal, state and local governments and their departments and agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In signing the convention on 22 August 1990 and ratifying it on 17 December 1990, Australia undertook a solemn obligation, together with other countries, to make necessary changes to its domestic law, policies and practices to bring these into line with the principles of the convention. There is no way individual sovereign countries can be compelled to take such action except through the persuasive pressure of world opinion. One of the ways to bring this world opinion to bear is to require regular reports on the progress they are making and thus to monitor the degree to which signatory countries are meeting their obligations under the convention. The Australian government undertook to provide such reports to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. The first report is in the process of being compiled and is already eight months overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This draft report, containing contributions from all Australian governments, shows very modest advances in Australia's progress in the terms of the convention; nor does it mention backward steps, such as the Western Australian juvenile justice legislation, the Victorian indeterminate sentencing legislation and the Victorian Crimes (Amendment) Act, or the failure to provide adequate access by children to their mothers in Victorian prisons. As well, there is the general reluctance to accept that children have a right to separate legal representation in court proceedings affecting them, for instance in the Family Court. It is time Australian governments took positive steps to meet their obligations to Australian children. This declaration which is now the subject of a disallowance motion is an important step in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration by the Commonwealth minister on 22 December 1992 that the convention is an `international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms for the purposes of the Act'&mdash;that is, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission Act&mdash;does not incorporate it into Australian law in a substantive way. It does, however, give the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission the same responsibilities for promoting the understanding and acceptance of the convention and for inquiring into and reporting on possible breaches as the commission currently has in relation to a number of other fundamental human rights instruments, such as the United Nations conventions on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights and the conventions on racial discrimination and sex discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons advanced for this quite unbelievable attempt to disallow the declaration is that it is an attack on the family and on the rights of parents. In fact, the convention strongly affirms the importance of the family. The preamble to the convention recognises that the family is `the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Article 5 requires that parties to the convention:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents . . . to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Much has been made of the suggestion Senator Tate, the then Minister for Justice, made in 1990 that ratification of the convention should be reserved&mdash;in other words, made subject&mdash;to the pre-eminent role of the family. It is difficult to see why this should be necessary when the fundamental role of the family is acknowledged in the convention as outlined above. It is useful to quote in full article 5 of the convention which stipulates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the present Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was a very clear statement in the body of the convention of the rights and responsibilities of parents and the intimate relationship between parents and children which this convention seeks to safeguard. It is worth noting that this article was inserted in the convention at the initiative of the Australian delegation and no doubt at Senator Tate's instigation. In that connection, it is worth noting that if coalition speakers had continued the quotation from Senator Tate's speech they would have found a reference to the fact that the Australian delegation had inserted article 5 in the convention, and therefore that the reservation he had in mind was clearly not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In substantive terms, the family obviously provides the best protection for children, but there must be a very important proviso. In fact, it may have been a consideration when inserting this provision into the body of the convention and not reserving it that, while most children are protected and nurtured within a family environment, there is a substantial and tragic minority who need to be protected from their own parents and guardians and a government cannot diminish its capacity to provide this protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 June this year, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least 20,000 Australian children were subjected to physical, emotional or sexual abuse or neglect in 1990-91 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This was according to a national report on child abuse and neglect. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report found that most offences were committed by parents or guardians, except in the case of sexual abuse, where 89 per cent were attributed to friends and neighbours. The report showed that 49,721 cases of child abuse and neglect were reported to and investigated by state and territory departments in 1990-91. Of these, 18,273 children were involved in substantiated cases and a further 2,545 were assessed as being at risk, putting the abuse rate at five cases per 1,000 children aged up to 16. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a shameful and tragic state of affairs, and I believe that it is equally shameful for someone to suggest that we should slow down the process of monitoring how our various governments are trying to cope with the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more such material on record. With respect to health and health services, the convention states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The child has a right to the highest standard of health and medical care attainable. States shall place special emphasis on the provision of primary and preventative health care, public health education and the reduction of infant mortality.</PARA>
<PARA>The most basic indicators of child health place Australia l8th out of a possible 33 industrialised countries. The under-five mortality rate of 10 in 100 for the general population has to be compared with the really shameful and tragic fact that this figure doubles for rural Aboriginal children. The poor state of health of Australia's indigenous children relates to a disproportionate amount of poverty and homelessness amongst this group of children. Aboriginal child poverty is so severe that it prompted Dr Graham McIntosh to say that the findings of his research in South Australia resembled `a situation more commonly found in reports about poverty stricken Ethiopia than affluent Australia'. Professor of social work Jan Carter points out that `Aboriginal child poverty has been omitted from the government's strategy of child poverty'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics on immunisation rates in general, and in the Aboriginal community in particular, have also been criticised. So has the lack of preventative health services for children, guidance for parents on planned parenting, and the provision of primary health care information for children. Clearly, the government would do well to look at article 24 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which relates to the key characteristics of adequate health care, in conjunction with the independent report on our compliance, `Where rights are wronged', by the National Children's Bureau of Australia in March 1993, and to plan for better services in the future. I reiterate&mdash;it cannot be said too often&mdash;that the declaration by the minister was, and I trust will be after the vote today in this Senate, a significant step in monitoring the performance of our government to achieve the objectives of the convention. Any attempt to slow it down should be something about which those people trying to do it should consult their consciences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to housing. In his national inquiry into child homelessness, Commissioner Brian Burdekin revealed that youth homelessness was widespread. He suggested that it was caused in large part by family poverty, physical, emotional and sexual abuse, and the lack of adequate preventative programs for youth in crisis. His report estimated that there were at least 20,000 to 25,000 and perhaps as many as 70,000 homeless children and young people across the country, including at least 8,500 aged from 12 to 15. The fact that many children are forced to prostitute themselves for survival and that the incidence of sexual and physical violence against them is very high is, it need hardly be said, in obvious breach of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the topic of sexual exploitation. The convention states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The state shall protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse, including prostitution and involvement in pornography.</PARA>
<PARA>Substantiated cases of sexual abuse in Australia, except ACT and Tasmania, in the year 1989-90 were for girls 3,100 and for boys 900. There was also a marked increase in the number of substantiated cases of physical, emotional and sexual abuse of girls aged 12 to 16 years, compared with other age groups. A greater emphasis on the convention, and a greater drive towards meeting our obligations under the convention, would serve Australia well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to juvenile justice. The convention states that a child in conflict with the law has the right to treatment which promotes the child's sense of dignity and worth, takes the child's age into account, and aims at his or her reintegration into society. The child is entitled to basic guarantees as well as legal or other assistance for his or her defence. I have already mentioned the Victorian and Western Australian government actions which have increased judicial control over children in what I believe to be the most inappropriate of ways. I further mention that the indeterminate sentences legislation in Victoria covers people of 17 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 12 of the convention relates to the right of the child to legal representation. As far as I am aware, no legislation that is now enacted by Australian parliaments places an obligation on police to ensure that detained children have access to independent legal advice or representation. There are many other matters in the legal system that we should advert to, but time does not permit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to refugees. The detention of children seeking asylum in immigration processing centres for periods of up to three years is clearly in contravention of basic principles of human rights and justice, and of the element of the convention which guards against arbitrary detention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point needs to be made again that the declaration by the minister achieves nothing beyond enabling the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to monitor progress and to report on breaches against the convention to the minister. It also would give it the power to educate the community and to publicise the instances of obvious neglect of hundreds of thousands of Australian children which I have adverted to today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we need to look very carefully&mdash;and that the coalition should look very carefully&mdash;at the action it proposes. It would not give the commission that capacity and would slow down that process. I believe the coalition, in concert with all representatives in this parliament, should be actively pursuing the government to resource the initiatives and to resource the process by which we will eventually comply with the objective of the convention, rather than bringing this despicable motion of disallowance which would remove one of the avenues of exerting pressure on this federal government and on state governments to take action to improve the life chances of Australian children. </PARA>

Senator Spindler has been talking about the effect, or the non-effect, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. He said that it has no effect in Australia except to enforce the power to educate the community. I think the government has done a pretty fair job in that area. It does not need another convention to force it into educating the community in what is right and what is wrong with our children. If the convention has no effect, why did we sign it?

In my own state of Tasmania I have already seen the effect of these United Nations conventions that we have signed. The convention gives the Commonwealth the chance to override states' powers.

That has been mentioned by my colleagues and by people in the community.

We had reservations before the last election and we said so. We said that, if we got into government, we would put those reservations in the convention and then we would go ahead and ratify it. On 21 February 1991, Mr Peacock, the honourable member for Kooyong in the other place, made it quite clear when he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the aims of the convention are quite laudable.

<PARA>Those two quotes, and what has been said today by my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Vanstone, have made it quite clear that we genuinely support this convention. But our position in relation to reservations has always been apparent right from the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention is a further development of the declaration of Geneva relating to the rights of the child, which was adopted as long ago as 1924 as a response to the problems being suffered by children after World War I. These problems have not stopped; they have continued right through to this very day. In 1959 the United Nations adopted its own declaration of the rights of the child which related to 10 principles to guide parents, governments and others in the treatment of their children. So this is nothing new. As Senator Boswell said, in 1979 the United Nations Human Rights Committee commenced drafting the current convention relating to children's rights. We all know that that convention was unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 1989, and came into force internationally on 2 September 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, some components of the convention relating to behaviour patterns would be almost unanimously supported by the general community. In particular, such matters as child prostitution and child slavery are referred to in the convention. My colleague from the Australian Democrats has concerns about this. I know that the government has been concerned about this. Members of the government have travelled to Asia. The Minister for Justice, Mr Kerr, went to Asia recently to look at the problems regarding Australians, in particular, sexually abusing child prostitutes in Thailand. The government has been taking steps to do all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my speech, if this convention has no power, why the hell are we signing it? Why are we leaving ourselves open to the possibility of its being used and having the unintended consequences that we have seen in other conventions? The Catholic Church&mdash;the Holy See&mdash;and some members of the Presbyterian Church in my own state have all had concerns about this and they have relayed them to me and to other members of the parliament. They are not doing it because they do not believe in the rights of the child; they are not doing it because they do not believe in parliament having the power to impose sensible laws on the population; they are doing it because they are genuinely concerned about the possibility that some rights unintentionally may be taken away from the parents. </PARA>

It is getting harder and harder, with the social pressures, unemployment and the like, to be a good parent and to run a family these days. But I think the record of the family unit in Australia has been second to none in the world. The two basic things that most people in this country hold dear are the freedom of religion and the freedom to be a good parent. In the last two days we have had before us two conventions which try to tell Australians how they should conduct their religion and how they should bring up their children. That is what people are objecting to: being told by the United Nations&mdash;in this case, through this government&mdash;what they should be doing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia ratified the convention in 1990, after it was adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 1989. This is not a new convention; we have been a signatory to it since 1990. What has occurred is that in January of this year the government sought to incorporate that convention into the charter of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, to give effect to that convention. That is important because it provides for a more detailed statement of the rights of a child beyond those contained in the international covenant, but most importantly it provides government support to give effect to monitoring the rights of the child recognised in that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have heard from the Liberal Party today is that it supports the rhetoric, it supports the convention, but if the government moves to do anything about that rhetoric to actually give it some force and some teeth, it will oppose it. Liberal Party members do not mind mouthing the rhetoric, but they are opposed to enforcing the principles that underline the declaration. If they were opposed to the convention, the time to oppose it was in 1990, but they were full of good words then. Today they are full of good words about the intent, but they have difficulties with the detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What they have difficulties with is our actually ensuring that the rights of children provided for in the convention are given effect to. That is what this does; it allows the human rights commission to give effect to those rights which we were all happy to accept and to monitor the government's performance in giving effect to those rights. It does not tell the parents what to do or how to bring up their children. It monitors the government's performance in honouring its obligations to the UN convention which we all agreed was worthwhile and deserving of signature in 1990. So that is what this debate is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I do not think opposition members really have their hearts in this; some of them do because they come from a principle of opposition to the UN, some sort of xenophobia about anything outside Australia. But I think the more small-l liberal members of the opposition have a great deal of difficulty with the opposition's position on this. When you look at the speeches of Senator Vanstone and Daryl Williams QC, as with the debate on the declaration of religion, their hearts are not in this because really it is a very conservative, very reactionary step to oppose what the government has done on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, they support the rhetoric but the best they can do in opposing this is talk about the lack of clarity, express some reservations, talk about some community concerns and some lack of understanding about the UN conventions and their role in Australia. That is all very fine but they never actually get to the heart of it. They say they support the UN declaration on the child, but when we want to do something about it they look for pseudo-legalistic arguments to try to prevent us actually giving some teeth and some effect to that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People like Senator Watson have put a genuinely held view about concerns about the rights of parents. I accept that there has been some community concern about the effect of that declaration but that concern is totally misplaced; it is totally based on the misinformation and fog that has surrounded this issue. It is one of the most highly supported declarations throughout the world. Even the Holy See has seen fit to ratify the convention so this is not something Australians ought to be concerned about. There is no negative effect on the rights of parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In support of that, in reply to some of the arguments that have been put it is important for people to understand what article 5 of the convention states. That is an article amended in part by an Australian initiative to overcome some of the concerns people had. Article 5 of the convention states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States Parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family or community as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognised in the present Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a clear recognition of the role of parents. The convention does not tell parents how to raise their children; it tells governments how to fulfil their responsibilities to children in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at the opposition arguments in this matter, they fail to raise any widespread or authoritative community support for their position. We have all had letters from members of the community concerned about this issue, but the way to deal with that is to explain to them properly the impact of the convention and how this will impact on Australian society, not to act as a conduit for their fear and misunderstanding. Some leadership is required, and I will come to that issue again later. But what are the people in Australian society with an interest in this issue saying? I think the first thing I will do is briefly quote the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity today to talk in the public interest debate on a very significant report that has recently been compiled by commercial and private interests in my electorate, the Northern Territory. This report refers specifically the economic impact of Ranger, Australia's largest uranium mine, and is entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The contribution of the Ranger uranium mine to the Northern Territory and Australian economies</EMPHASIS>. The report is a 71-page study that was prepared for the mining company Energy Resources of Australia Ltd by the Canberra based consultants ACIL. This report describes the good neighbour role of Ranger, a controversial but commercially significant mine in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report estimates the economic contribution of this Northern Territory mine over its first 11 years, as well as the flow-on benefits to Aboriginal people. In today's money terms, the mine has contributed the equivalent of $5.3 billion to the national economy. It has paid $86 million in royalties to the Northern Territory government and has accounted for seven per cent of the Northern Territory's economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly aware of the very great contribution that has arisen through the consequential activities of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, which has a very important environmental monitoring role, and has in effect come about because of the life of this mine. Significant also is the role of the tourism that has been generated because of the very important presence of the uranium mine and the associated activities that have been connected both with the mine activity and tourism activity through the infrastructure in the adjoining township of Jabiru. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very important for both the Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land and the new residents of the township of Jabiru are the associated health and education facilities that have been injected into this important region. Much has been said about the potential of uranium mining in this country, but I would like to concentrate today on Aboriginal people and the benefits flowing to them via the royalties and the rentals from Ranger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to the report. There are some very significant points in the introduction, including the estimated magnitude of Ranger's contributions to GDP and government revenue. There is also a chart that refers to the main components of the Ranger project's economic contribution to June 1992, which is highlighted in 1991-92 money terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chart on page 12 of the report highlights the total of ERA revenue and expenses from 1981-82 to 1991-92. That chart deals with the revenue in historical value terms and also the value in current money terms. It compares the revenue, the production expenses, the various expenses of the mine, the dividends paid and the value-added components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charts that are set out in detail on pages 53 to 56 highlight in particular the various benefits that flow through what is called the Northern Territory input-output table, across all the significant industries: meat, cattle, fishing, hunting, manufacturing, wholesale, construction, transport, communications, finance, machinery and equipment, residential construction, health and education, entertainment, and many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In referring to Aboriginal people, I would like to highlight that in 1978 an agreement was negotiated between the Commonwealth government and the Northern Land Council to allow mining on the Ranger project area. The agreement covered the payment of rent and royalties, environmental controls, Aboriginal employment and training, liaison between mining and Aboriginal interests, and education of mining employees about Aboriginal culture. Since then, Aboriginal groups have received in royalties the equivalent of $288 million in today's money terms. According to the report, Ranger payments represent `a very significant proportion of the incomes received by the traditional landowners of Ranger, the Northern Land Council and the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory as a whole'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To refer again to the report, on pages 57 to 59 there are important schedules and tables setting out the income, the expenditure and employment in three of the four Northern Territory Aboriginal land councils&mdash;the Northern Land Council, the Central Land Council and the Tiwi Land Council&mdash;which have all benefited very significantly and directly from the activities of the Ranger mine. With millions of dollars passing through the Aboriginal benefits trust account on behalf of Aboriginal people, it is important that the ABTA have the full confidence and trust of Aboriginal people. Yet, unfortunately, this is not the case. A number of senior and credible Aboriginal leaders in the Northern Territory have come to me recently with concerns about the administration and the operation of the Aboriginal benefits trust account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on their information and the evidence that I have uncovered during Senate estimates hearings, my concerns were conveyed earlier this year to the Aboriginal affairs minister, Mr Tickner. He has since ordered an investigation by the Auditor-General into the ABTA and into the land council administration. I understand that the outcome should be known later this year and will be tabled in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to one of the Aboriginal success stories in the Northern Territory, particularly related to the Ranger project. The Gagudju Association, set up in 1979 on behalf of traditional owners of the Ranger project area, has the role of administering agreement and royalty moneys from mining at Ranger. It is up to the 330 members of that association to decide how the money is spent. According to the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association has a balanced expenditure policy which includes disbursement of moneys for the immediate benefit of individuals or communities in the Association and investments in a range of economic activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Elsewhere the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investments of Ranger royalty and rental funds made by the Gagudju Association in particular will safeguard the welfare of local landowners for years beyond the mine's life.</PARA>
<PARA>So far, the Gagudju Association investments have included the establishment of a children's trust to safeguard children's share of payments received, as only adults can be members of the Gagudju Association, and tourist ventures such as Gagudju Cooinda Lodge and the Gagudju Crocodile Hotel. I am sure that many honourable senators and many other people in the Australian community are well aware of these important and first-class facilities now operating in close proximity to the Ranger mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other business ventures, such as a mobile food store, the Border Store in the East Alligator River area, mechanical and civil engineering workshops, a construction business, a buffalo farm, and real estate purchases in Darwin. Given the long-term nature of these investment decisions, it is not surprising that individual members of the Gagudju Association receive only a modest annual income payment of between $1,000 and $2,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commend Gagudju on providing members with potential long-term opportunities for employment, particularly in the tourist industry, as well as a measure of economic independence rarely found in remote Aboriginal communities. Ranger's contribution to all Australians cannot be underestimated. Importantly, that significant contribution to Australia, whether it is through taxation, through mining activity directly or indirectly or through infrastructure support, is all highlighted in the report that is here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly a matter of regret that Labor's three-mine uranium policy acts today as a heavy hand of control over the development of this important uranium industry. This report highlights the benefits that flow, whether through direct job employment, through the community in so many ways or to Aboriginal communities directly, but that are currently being thwarted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a question in this House earlier this week, I highlighted the hypocrisy of the Labor government in its current policies with regard to uranium and the uranium industry. Very importantly, this government has lifted the sanctions on South Africa. That means that Australia will now be in open competition, as it should be, for all commodities, including mining products and including the trade in uranium. It means that South Africa now enters an open forum in this important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, at the same time, the Labor Party has decided to keep the lid on uranium in Australia, thereby denying very important opportunities to so many areas. The government's hypocrisy in the way in which it has dealt with the South African issue and yet has a very different, discriminatory policy against Aboriginal people in Australia, who would be significant beneficiaries of an open policy on uranium mining, stands out for everyone to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the day when new uranium mining is allowed to open in this country so that Australians can benefit further from this important industry. The report that I have highlighted, which deals with the contribution of the Ranger uranium mine to the Northern Territory and Australian economies, is significant. I seek leave of the Senate to table this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arms exhibition, which touted Australia as a weapons dealer and armaments manufacturer to this region and to the world at large, attracted some 1,200 demonstrators from peace, disarmament, church, political and union groups. Some 400 officers were deployed during the demonstrations. Honourable senators may recall that I and some other Democrat senators spent as much time as parliamentary duties would allow at the AIDEX demonstrations and that I reported then to the Senate my observation that police were using excessive force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I vividly recall one occasion when some teenagers lined up behind me saying, `They will not hit us if you are standing in front of us'. The Commonwealth ombudsman, Philippa Smith, describes `the painful and potentially injurious holds' members of the Australian Federal Police employed, even on compliant protesters, including wrist locks, angle of the jaw pressure, hair pulling, ear pulling, kneeing and so on. She describes it in dispassionate language, which is nonetheless chilling. It is confirmation of my own observation that in many instances police officers went beyond their proper professional role and adopted the attitude of combatants in a battle, often exacerbated by lack of planning and supervision and a clear chain of command, as well as inadequate training and inadequate arrest procedures and lack of identification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a response which goes a long way towards the code of conduct I called for at the time, the ombudsman says in a letter to me that the AFP has received her report constructively and that discussions are under way to take action to improve these aspects. The ombudsmen also acknowledges that in many cases police officers were provoked by some protesters and that some 40 officers sustained injuries in the subsequent scuffles. The point remains that police officers must have the capacity to respond in a professional manner, and that people exercising their democratic right of political protest should not be intimidated or injured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, 169 people lodged complaints against police behaviour. There were 410 separate allegations, and I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of these, 78 have been found to be unsubstantiated, 157 to be incapable of determination, 6 have been found to be substantiated and 1 reconciled. Discretion has been exercised under section 24 of the Complaints Act not to investigate 84 complaints involving 168 allegations, mostly because the complainant could not be contacted or a person more directly involved in the incident had complained. Six people have withdrawn their complaints. Action has still to be completed in 8 cases.</PARA>
<PARA>The large number of unresolved complaints is due, in large measure, to the high standard of proof&mdash;namely, beyond reasonable doubt&mdash;now employed in the assessment of complaints against police. Given the importance of maintaining community confidence in the integrity of our police force, the civil balance of probability standard would seem more appropriate, and I understand that this is now under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The large number of complaints directed through my office&mdash;that is, 114&mdash;points to one other large area of concern highlighted in the ombudsman's report, namely the investigation of complaints against police by the AFP's own internal investigation unit and the reluctance of potential complainants to make complaints against Caesar and have them investigated by Caesar. In real terms, channelling the complaints really only made sure that the complaints went to the right address and also made it possible for me to receive progress reports from the ombudsman's office. It is, however, important to appreciate that the motivation for people to channel their complaints through my office was the desire to avoid harassment by police who may have become aware of the identity of the complainants. Indeed, I have received reports of two occasions where local protesters were subsequently accosted by police but significantly, they did not wish to pursue the matter for fear of further harassment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other motivation was the wish to ensure, as far as possible, that proper investigation is undertaken&mdash;something that I could not influence, of course, to any great degree. Again, the community's perception is important. Ombudsman Philippa Smith devotes a substantial part of her report to this aspect. She details the lack of objectivity of some investigatory reports which were disregarding and distorting evidence and slanting it in favour of police colleagues. She also adverts to the delays caused by the lack of investigatory staff, the lack of the management control system for the investigating process and last, but not least, the lack of staff in her own office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned that the burden of proof for complaints is likely to receive early attention. It is pleasing to note also that a joint ombudsman-AFP working party will examine the training and case management procedures of the internal investigation unit. It remains for me to urge strongly that the ombudsman must have the capacity to act on her own initiative in cases of complaints against police, as the ombudsman has in all other areas. This applies in particular to the investigation of complaints which the ombudsman might wish to pursue when a parallel complaint has been lodged by another person. At the moment this choice is not open to the ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other necessary and urgent action is to increase the staff resources of the office to ensure that as much of the investigation as possible is carried out by the ombudsman's office. These measures are essential if the community is to maintain&mdash;or, in many cases, regain&mdash;respect and confidence in our police forces and in the safeguards of our democratic system to ensure that the democratic right to political protest is not eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it is refreshing in this instance to see that an agency such as the ombudsman's office is not content simply to provide a report, but has become actively engaged in follow-up work to ensure that some of the deficiencies that have been identified are in fact addressed. In large measure this satisfies my own requirement, which I suggested at the time, of a code of conduct for such occasions. In conclusion, I wish to state that the thoroughness and objectivity of this report, and the constructive improvement already under way as a result, have done a lot to bolster my own confidence in the safeguards of our democratic system, and have given me new motivation to build on this and to improve current arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond briefly to Senator Spindler's comments. If he had said that he was appalled by the behaviour of some of these demonstrators who used violence in order to pursue a political objective, and appalled by their treatment of police who were simply seeking to do their job, then much of what he said in the remainder of his speech about how the ombudsman's office might be further strengthened and so forth would have been a useful contribution to debate. To leave simply Senator Spindler's words on the record would result in an unbalanced and unfair impression in relation to the very difficult circumstances with which the police here in Canberra were faced in this demonstration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler said that individuals were exercising their democratic right of political protest. We have no objection to an exercise of the democratic right of political protest. In fact, we all stand firm in our belief that it is essential to preserving our democracy. But in this country the democratic right of political protest does not include the level of violence that was demonstrated by these demonstrators&mdash;violence that resulted, as the ombudsman admitted, in some 40 police officers receiving broken bones, bites, grazes and strains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go on with other reports. I was not present at the demonstration, but these are reports of other people who, with Senator Spindler, were personally present. Apart from the broken bones, stabs, grazes, chemical burns and bruises, there were reports in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of police officers being sprayed with urine and faeces, and of roads being blockaded with buses, cars and metal to try to prevent police intervention. Not surprisingly, there were reports of police being verbally and physically abused. There were also reports of protesters placing booby traps in pine trees along Northbourne Avenue; of police finding pieces of wood with nails embedded in them buried at the protest site to take out police bikes; of mature trees cut down to obstruct police; and of protesters throwing missiles at police, including avocados studded with nails, syringes and barbed wire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is appalling and unacceptable behaviour in any form of political protest in this country in any circumstances. At the start of his speech, Senator Spindler should have risen in this place and unambiguously condemned it, then he could have gone on and talked about the police needing to learn from this unsatisfactory state of affairs. Maybe that would have been, with respect, a more useful contribution. That behaviour should be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of regret, I think, that the ombudsman obviously determined that it was out of her charter to provide the balance in her report.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it is not part of my task in this overview to pass any judgment on the actions of the demonstrators, or any other civilians.</PARA>
<PARA>That may be how she has interpreted her task; I am not here to take issue with that at the moment. What I am taking issue with is, when we analyse her report and her advice to police on how they might act in similar circumstances if, regrettably, they again occur in this country, we should nevertheless take into account the very severe and almost unique provocation that they received in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police in this country simply are not experienced in handling riotous behaviour.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that this protest followed shortly upon a violent protest in Melbourne at the visit of President Bush of the United States. I understand many of the protesters who tried to influence political events in Melbourne by violent means were in fact the same protesters who moved to Canberra for that purpose. That is a worrying development in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was interesting to note the comments of some of the police officers after the Victorian protest. The Victorian acting chief commissioner, John Frame, said he was proud of his people and said, `Quite frankly, I'm absolutely sickened by the violence displayed towards the police'. Why did not Senator Spindler say he was sickened by the violence displayed towards the police rather than what he did say today, that he regarded the conduct of the police as chilling. I want to say that I understand what Mr Frame was saying in relation to the Victorian circumstance, and I can understand how the senior officers of the Federal Police in the ACT would have been equally appalled by the conduct of these protesters towards police officers here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Frame went on to say, `We don't use riot squads in this state'&mdash;he was talking about the Victorian experience&mdash;`and I hope there will never be a need for our police to act as riot squads in this country'. One way to ensure that does not occur is to have people get up in this place and condemn such violent protests as totally illegitimate within our political system. I hope next time Senator Spindler gets up he does exactly that. Mr Frame continued, `I'm not prepared to have our young members made punching bags'. I think that is a more than reasonable expectation of any senior police officer in relation to his men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the violence in these two demonstrations was organised. I accept there were a lot of protesters within the 1,200 estimated to be there who were not violent. They were doing what I would stand up and support&mdash;protesting against political action that they disagreed with. It is a pity that a minority, apparently organised, it is said, by the international socialist movement, decided to bring violence as a means of achieving political outcomes into the Australian political framework. It is that minority that I am standing here to condemn today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that all senators and, in future, Senator Spindler, will be prepared to join with me in condemning that violence.

It was the first time that I had been to such a demonstration for quite a long while. I am quite proud of having demonstrated against the former Court government's anti-assembly laws some years before. In fact, I think I recognised from 10 or 15 years ago many of the faces at the student demonstration. This was the first time since then that I have been in a demonstration situation, even though I did visit AIDEX.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make to the Senate is this: having been out to AIDEX, I think on the last day, I raised with Jo Vallentine, who was a senator at that time, the fact that there was an enormous amount of rubbish sprinkled all around the exhibition. Any honourable senators who went out there would have seen that. The demonstrators had also put up an enormous array of signs, and there were bits of paper strewn all over the fences surrounding the AIDEX exhibition ground. I said to Jo Vallentine that I would not take her peace and green activists very seriously when it came to environmental matters unless I saw that all tidied up over the next couple of days. The then Senator Vallentine very earnestly said that she could not possibly agree with leaving a mess everywhere and that she would make sure it was all fixed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when I came back to Canberra the next Monday, there was still a disgusting mess. One really does wonder about these sorts of people. If they cannot keep their own backyards tidy and look after the public areas of Australia and if they are not even prepared to pick up after themselves, how much do they really care about the rest of the natural environment? That quite disgusted me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The topic on which I rise today follows on from a matter I raised about three weeks ago during the adjournment debate. As I reported to the Senate at the time, this matter relates to what I considered to be a deal done between Kim Beazley, the Australian Labor Party member for the seat of Swan in Western Australia, and a Mr Luke Garswood, a student activist, a National Union of Students office holder and a member of the Labor Party until a few weeks before the last federal election, who ran as an independent candidate for the seat of Swan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accused Mr Garswood and Mr Beazley of doing an overt, if not covert, deal to ensure that Mr Beazley was returned. Most of us in this chamber would know that Mr Beazley was returned with only a very small majority of votes. I suggested at the time that Mr Garswood, a student activist, had agreed to run in the seat of Swan and to provide his preferences to Mr Beazley, and that those preferences would have been very influential in getting Mr Beazley elected. Having examined the flow of the preferences quite accurately since I made that speech, I find it is quite clear that Mr Garswood's preferences did play a very significant role in ensuring that Mr Beazley was returned to take up his present role as the Minister for Education, Employment and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to apprise the Senate of a bit more information that has come to light. Mr Garswood and Mr Beazley have both denied that there was any sort of deal. One would not expect Mr Garswood or Mr Beazley to come out and say, `Yes, Senator Campbell was dead right. We did shake hands and make a deal'. So that is not surprising. I thought it would be good for the Senate to see that Luke Garswood did indeed direct his preferences quite clearly to Mr Beazley. I have the how-to-vote card. It took quite a search to find it but I was able to locate one. I have sought the minister's approval to incorporate the how-to-vote card in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, if it is technically possible. There is a picture of Mr Garswood on the card, so to incorporate it may not be technically possible. </PARA>

I would ask the minister for approval to</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was one further mistake made in reporting my contribution to the Senate. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Campus Review</EMPHASIS>, a campus newspaper from Western Australia, reported that I had raised these allegations when the Senate was considering the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, which we will be considering in a few sitting days time, I presume. In that bill Mr Beazley will be seeking to ensure that any state governments that introduce voluntary student unionism and give students the freedom to decide whether they join a student union or not will have their state grants reduced by up to $5 million. That is an outrageous trammelling of states' powers to make laws in these matters. The opposition has, just this week, announced that it will be voting against the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill on the grounds that this is a very unusual intrusion on states rights in trying to dictate to a state government how it should legislate in relation to matters on campus.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, as you well know, the road transport industry is in many respects the lifeblood of this nation. That is especially clear to those of us who come from the less populous states, such as the Northern Territory from where the minister comes, which are large in area but small in population. It is clear to those who come from Western Australia, like my good friend Senator Panizza, who frequently speaks on road transport issues and who I understand is following me in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand the importance of having a road transport regime in terms of regulation which works, which is responsive to the methods of the industry and, importantly, which is responsive to the needs of the consumers of that industry. Of course, the consumers of road transport industry services are the businesses, be they large or small, which are at the end of the transport routes. It is important from the point of view of this nation's wellbeing that we reduce as much as possible our road transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also generally accepted, particularly by the industry itself, that there is some necessity for uniformity in road transport regulations. I know that some of the proposed uniformities have been a matter of much contention across the floor of this chamber. Senator Collins will recall as well as I do the arguments we had in 1990 and 1991 in relation to the road transport charges and the proposed fees that were set out in that. The Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill does not really touch on the charges, but sets out to make it possible to create a uniform set of road regulations which have been agreed to by the states. The intention is that those uniform regulations would be adopted in modules in relation to particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us in the coalition have looked at the matter very carefully. In our party room there was careful consideration of this because of the concerns of a number of states. For example, Western Australia is not endorsing the heads of agreement which have been put together and are the basis of the bill which is brought before the chamber today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Minister for Transport in Western Australia, the Hon. Eric Charlton, wrote on 31 August to the National Road Transport Commission advising that Western Australia's position was not `derived from any desire to undermine the national reform process or obligations arising from the heads of government agreements'. He did point out, however, that Western Australia's position was different because `the geography and demography of this state are sufficiently different to warrant, on occasion, different transport solutions from the rest of the country'. I think that is a viewpoint that is reflected by many of the other states. I know that in South Australia there was concern about implementation of all of the proposals and, similarly, in Tasmania and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that this proposal will be agreed to by the opposition but we note that there is still far from unanimity amongst the states, and these are matters that will have to be worked through. We cannot have a situation arise where uniformity becomes all important and the needs and interests of the states are subjugated to that. For example, in Queensland we have a system of volumetric loading&mdash;as you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, being a Liberal Party senator from Queensland. Volumetric loading is important, particularly in the livestock industry. The ability to load one or two decks of cattle on the truck and get the truck away is very useful. It makes the transport industry much more efficient and it reduces the transport cost to the consumers of the services, namely, the beef cattle industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we need to keep transport costs down in the beef cattle industry because the prices themselves are low. It would be a nonsensical position if uniformity in road regulations meant that Queensland could not keep volumetric loading, because the roads, the conditions and the needs of the industries all suit volumetric loading. A lot of work has been done on that and it has worked very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in Queensland at the moment the government is reviewing some of the consequences of volumetric loading. You would be interested to know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that as a consequence of taking away the gross vehicle mass restrictions through volumetric loading, the tare weight of some of the stock crates has gone up immensely. So there are now vehicles and trailers that have a very large tare weight. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding from the road transport forum that one of the things the state government is looking at is restricting the tare weight, but not the gross weight, of those stock crates. We are finding that some stock crates are built basically around a very large RSJ&mdash;a reinforced steel joist&mdash;and as a consequence are very hard to destroy. However, they are putting immense weight on the roads.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not the intention of volumetric loading. Obviously, this is something that will be addressed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this is going to cause a little bit of concern and angst in the industry because many people have invested in these stock crates; and they are a substantial investment. Four or five years ago when I was involved in the manufacture of stock crates, we were selling a stock crate for something like $60,000. Obviously, the cost is higher these days. But if the tare weight of those stock crates can be reduced, obviously my position, the position of the National Party and the position of the industry would be that there would have to be a transitional period. What we are saying is that we do not want uniformity to swamp the advances that are being made in some states and we do not want uniformity to be an excuse to make the industry less responsive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that New South Wales is also grappling with the issue of volumetric loading. I know that agreement has not been reached yet in New South Wales. But, if New South Wales decides to adopt this measure, it may take it on a different basis from Queensland. That is because the geography of New South Wales is different. Its main transport routes are much hillier than those of Queensland. There are particular difficulties in terms of the loading of vehicles which have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland we sometimes think that our roads are not particularly satisfactory, and many of them are not. However, having taken a trip recently along the Newell Highway, I know that there are many other roads in this country that are not as good as we would hope, and particular safety issues arise as a result of that. Again, safety issues have to be taken into consideration when regulations are being put into place, and that is why I believe that much more needs to be done in terms of getting uniform road regulations. The peak body of the road transport industry, the road transport forum, has been very supportive of uniform regulations and there are very good reasons why they should be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A transport operator in Queensland, having equipment that is lawful in Queensland, may have difficulties when he goes over the border into another state. Nobody in the industry sees any benefit in regulations restricting the right or the ability of operators to ply their trade in more than one state. That is something we have to look at, particularly as in many industries now there is a lot of interstate movement of road freight. In the livestock industry there has been a lot of interstate movement of road freight in the last 12 months because cattle have been taken from Queensland to areas as far away as the Murrumbidgee to be put on agistment. So these are not theoretical issues but very real issues which go to the right of people in the road transport industry to earn a decent living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go through some of the bits and pieces of the legislation. In division 2, clauses 15, 16 and 17 relate to emergency powers, application orders and exemptions. The first two are subject to termination by the ministerial council whereas the latter is not. This will remain under the control of state ministers, I understand. I note that Senator Collins is nodding and I thank him for that. That is the way it should be. The road transport forum does not quite agree with this because it sees it as compromising the integrity of the system. But I think that even the road transport industry has to accept the fact that particular circumstances will arise from time to time and will have to be catered for and they may vary from state to state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, the development of a national approach has to involve making judgments that are determined by the national interest. We have a difficult situation because the interests of individual states have to be balanced against the interests of the nation as a whole. The states have a lot of work to do. We all hope that a productive exchange will arise from this and that we will find productive and innovative solutions. I think the minister would agree that innovation will solve many of the problems. Rather than thinking in standard and established ways, maybe we need to look at different methods, in the same way as the road transport industry itself has looked at different methods of getting around problems, such as different combinations of rig and so on, to ensure that the vehicles that operate on particular routes are the ones best suited for the job, ones that give higher efficiency and ultimately better benefits to the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In agreeing to the passage of this bill, the National and Liberal parties recognise the concerns of the individual states and of some transport operators. We recognise that regional circumstances and requirements must be taken into consideration and must not be ridden roughshod over. However, the politics of the national interest and ultimately the interest of the road transport industry have led us to agree to this bill. But we believe that we have an obligation to the industry, as we have always supported the industry in the past, to express its concerns and viewpoints in the course of this debate. I have nothing more to say other than that we hope there will be continued cooperation between the states, the federal government and the road transport industry and that the consequence of this legislation will be of benefit to all concerned&mdash;the consumers and the operators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not scheduled to speak in this debate. I know that my colleague Senator Panizza wants to contribute. However, as he is not in the chamber at the moment, I will speak briefly to the broad question of funding for road transport and other matters that are the subject of the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill 1993. As my colleague Senator O'Chee has mentioned, there is a desire right throughout Australia to seek some uniformity, but not uniformity at the expense of particular matters that are specific to individual states. That desire for uniformity is in the national interest and is part of the economic reform which this government talks a lot about; it has not done much about it but it certainly talks a lot about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, of course, concerned that there is never quite enough money for road transport generally, which is the lifeblood of Australia's economic system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that I speak for Senator Panizza, in his absence, in saying that I know that he, too, would support this legislation. I do thank Senator O'Chee and Senator Ian Macdonald for their contributions to the debate. What Senator O'Chee has said is perfectly correct. The industry does support this legislation and, frankly, it is entitled to get it. The reason I say that is that there are two aspects of the national approach: one to do with charges and one to do with regulations. Particularly in terms of the short-term benefits to the industry itself in getting a sensible regime of uniform regulations across Australia, I think those benefits will be far more quickly realised in the regulation area than in the charging area because the new charges are not proposed to commence until 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say to Senator O'Chee that I was able to speak to all the state transport ministers last week. I met personally with most of them. Unfortunately, I could not fit Tasmania in but I did speak to the Tasmanian minister by telephone. All those state ministers reaffirmed the support of their governments for the national approach. However, the point Senator O'Chee made is correct in terms of the regional differences that do exist in this approach. He correctly pointed to that section of the legislation that provides for them with the application order process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the differences, such as they are&mdash;and they are minor&mdash;are regional differences, not partisan differences. There is a very high level of genuine cooperation on the ministerial council on this issue. That cooperation completely crosses party lines, and that will continue. Senator O'Chee has asked for reassurance on that point and I give it to him. There is a very high level of cooperation but we do recognise the regional differences. The application orders are, of necessity, considered to be an exception rather than the rule. Everyone agrees with that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the states that have not immediately endorsed the peg bill as it is known, again the attitude of the government is very strongly positive. In the case of some of the states&mdash;for example, New South Wales&mdash;that abstained from voting, the position simply is that the state ministers, mostly for the benefit of their cabinet colleagues, want to have a look at the flavour of the regulations before they make any recommendations to their respective cabinets about the introduction of the complementary legislation next year that hangs off this umbrella legislation that we are processing through the Senate today. I am pleased to say that can be achieved, because although the module approach has been adopted, the majority of those regulations will be completed&mdash;as the ministers know&mdash;before the end of this year, and state ministers will be able to have a good look at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that Senator O'Chee raised is that the uniformity approach should not inhibit innovative or technologically new solutions. It is an important point and I can assure Senator O'Chee and indeed the industry and everyone else that that will not happen. In fact, the reverse will be the case. As I am sure Senator O'Chee would appreciate, the entire thrust of this exercise is to enhance the efficiency of this industry. There are no partisan considerations in this. No-one is setting out to ambush anybody in this process. All ministers are joined in a common desire to see the ministerial council continue to improve, so far as it can at a political level, the opportunities for the transport industry. It truly is the lifeblood of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any innovative measures or new technological developments that come in&mdash;they are occurring all the time and I personally get representations on many of them from road transport operators&mdash;will be carefully considered by the ministerial council. Where there is a considered view that the overall impact on regulations of those changes will be positive rather than negative, I have got no doubt that either the regulation should be changed or the application order should be granted in that case. I guess it is a frustrating thing for people in public life in Australia that do want to see positive change for Australia and see some of these inefficiencies removed that that area of political problems generally known as states rights often intervenes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reiterating that there is no question of states rights involved in this case. Legitimate concerns about regional differences throughout Australia have been expressed by state ministers and there is a positive attitude by the whole ministerial council to cooperate with those concerns. I have got no doubt that, where state ministers can make out their case&mdash;we have a fairly informal approach to these things when we meet&mdash;and it is a persuasive case that it would be sensible for the industry and for the national benefit for these exceptions to be made, then the ministerial council will agree that those changes should be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say, as the transport minister, how pleased I am to see this legislation getting the support in the parliament that it has had from coalition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I know those opposite are very embarrassed about these figures that I am about to give because they have probably worked it out themselves. They are trying to work out how to avoid the situation where ordinary Australian men and women are going to have pay more tax every week from 15 November onwards if the Senate does not pass this package by 21 October. So people will lose the tax cut and the economic stimulus that will flow from the expenditure. Average workers will lose $50 or $60 in their pre-Christmas annual leave payments because of the increased rate of tax that will apply if this Senate fails to pass the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

Australian working men and women face a stark choice regarding the tax situation that they will face in the lead-up to Christmas. Will they get $50 or $60 extra in their leave payment when they go off on leave for Christmas or not? It is for them to judge. It is in the hands of this Senate. If the Senate passes the package, they will get it; if the Senate does not pass the package, they will not.</PARA>

Is he aware that Australian taxpayers will lose their promised tax cut only if the government decides to deny them that tax cut? It is on the government's head, no-one else's. Also, is it a fact that the so-called tax cut benefit that the government is talking about giving Australians for Christmas will be about $300 million? By that time, if its tax measures go through, the government will have ripped almost $500 million out of people's purchasing power?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to follow up with the second point I wanted to make. The way Senator Short expressed his question makes the second point, that is in stark contrast, absolutely clear. The opposition is not proposing a no-cost alternative. If it were in control of measures, we would not be in the situation where all these goodies would flow at no cost. I am not talking about its silly GST proposal; I am talking about funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is also talking about a lower deficit. It would fund tax cuts by slashing outlays.

That is what those opposite are significantly trying to cover up.</PARA>

During the same period of the last year elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;the category that the Australian Statistician sets aside for the most complex and sophisticated manufactured exports out of Australia&mdash;more than doubled from $131 million last year to $300 million this year. That is an increase of 128 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both elaborately transformed manufactures and simply transformed manufactures are now growing at twice the rate of the total exports to China. It ought to be noted, despite that very high increase, that the core trading export items out of Australia are coal, iron ore and agricultural products. In China, Australia is now getting a reputation as being a country which is a good source of manufactured goods, a sophisticated supplier of quality services and a high technology country which is able to supply quality technology competitive with that of Japan, the United States, Korea and Europe. We are seen as being able to compete effectively in quality with the innovations that the market wants, deliver on time and to price. It is a reputation for customised manufacturing and services and it is one that we should all want to promote as a broader image of the Australian manufacturing base.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr and a number of others have for some time been concerned generally about the issue of cigarettes and what we ought to be doing to curb their use in the community. He would be aware, as many in the chamber would be, that in April of 1992 all of the state health ministers and the Commonwealth health minister agreed to a very tough position on the labelling of cigarette packets. I think they might have got a little over-hyped on that occasion. Only two states, South Australia and Western Australia, and one territory, the ACT, ever acted on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came time for the ministers to meet again last July I was criticised by some in the anti-smoking lobby for daring to move a resolution which, while weakening that of last year, still took to us to equal with Canada, which has the toughest position in the world. I did that because it was necessary&mdash;as, I am sure, all senators would agree&mdash;to get a national position. Certainly, the national government and every state wanted it. So, after a long discussion, we came to the agreement that has now been abrogated by Victoria. That meeting was chaired by the Victorian health minister, who spoke in support of the resolution. I do not blame Marie Tehan; she has been overruled by her Premier.</PARA>

He wanted us to stick to the original, as did Wayne Berry in the ACT and Martyn Evans in South Australia. But, in order to get a national position, we compromised. Everyone was in heated agreement. We were all patting ourselves on the back. We had to reassure each other that we would stick to the deal. If you had to back who was going to rat on that sort of a deal, I reckon you would absolutely have to put the house on the old Jeff, on Premier Kennett. There he was, openly ratting again.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chris Evans for his question. Senator Chris Evans has shown considerable interest in this question of the Bunbury hospital and went with me to Bunbury a couple of weeks ago when we visited the public hospital, the private hospital and attended a massive meeting of Bunbury citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, in spite of Senator Panizza's earlier interjection, that the local Liberal member of state parliament has finally been dragged kicking and screaming to the barrier to come out opposing it. He is opposing it because wherever these kinds of proposals are produced there is an inevitable community reaction, because every community regards as its right&mdash;as well it should&mdash;the public hospital facilities to which it has always had access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the city of Bunbury a sum of $4 million has already been spent by the Western Australian government in getting a new public hospital ready. That has now been dumped for a new proposal. The proposal has been called a co-location. It is not, of course, a co-location; that would involve both a public and a private hospital in the one spot. On this occasion all the facilities will be owned privately. The government will be leasing some of those facilities in terms not yet known to the government or the private operator, let alone the people of Bunbury. It is no great shock, therefore, that people would be worried and deeply concerned about their health care for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past few days I have written to Minister Foss with some suggestions in accordance with a meeting I had with him on how this might best be solved. There is no guarantee that money will be saved. If honourable senators opposite believe that this will be in some way a great saving on the public purse, there is not even a guarantee of that. What we are seeing here is the replacement of the public sector by the private sector. There is no question that in the next decade the public sector will need to hire or lease services from the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last election campaign the government had as one of its planks in the health area a promise to do precisely that, and that will continue. That is a promise that, as Senator Ian Macdonald knows&mdash;that leader of the open-mouthed and empty-headed&mdash;we will keep. We are working towards it now, and in fact I met with the Australian Catholic Hospitals Association this very morning. But there is a very considerable problem when one stops using the private sector as a supplement to the public sector and replaces it. Once replaced, one wonders how one ever gets it back.</PARA>

Minister Foss indicated to me that he himself acknowledged that there were serious problems with this proposal. I can say that we will support the principle of co-location. I have suggested to Minister Foss a number of ways that that can take place and that the Commonwealth would be more than happy to cooperate. What we will not allow, what we will not ever sit back and support, is the use of the term co-location when, in fact, it is plain old privatisation; it is the plundering, the rape and the pillage of the public sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The final version of the legislation will become clear when the legislation is introduced into the parliament, and that is some way away. There are important issues involved in the matter raised by Senator Minchin. It is true that the government is examining possible changes to federal industrial relations law to improve the federal system's operation. In the course of that we are certainly looking at compliance measures. It is also true that the government regards civil actions in the ordinary courts as an inappropriate way of seeking to resolve industrial disputes. It is also true that the ILO committee of experts has reinforced this point, including by criticisms of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An option is that there should not be immediate access to the courts through sections 45D and E or to the common law where industrial action occurs in an industrial dispute. Under this option, pre-litigation conciliation by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission would be required before sections 45D or E action could occur. I understand that the `hit them with a big stick brigade' opposite does not like the fact that we might comply with reasonable international obligations about which they were enthusiastic, when those same people were critical of legislation relating to trade unions; they trumpeted it with some enthusiasm. This is called selective indignation.</PARA>

I ask the Minister whether he is aware that up to 75 SERCo staff will lose their jobs and homes, affecting up to 300 family members in a town of 1,300, and that continuing workers will lose up to $12,000 of their modest disposable incomes. Does he condone the actions of his department which has not only stripped workers of jobs, homes and income, but also has provided no counselling and support services to counter the health problems and family break-ups which are now occurring?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is occurring at Woomera is not an isolated incident. The Department of Defence embarked on the commercial support program as a result of not only the force structure review but the report done by Mr Wrigley. Essentially, we have discovered that we must put up certain activities for competition in order to reduce costs. In some cases, in-house bids have won; in other cases, private bids have won; and in this case, one private bid has replaced another private bid. The reason for doing this is not only to get the various military bases closer to the community and to move personnel from the blunt end to the sharp end, but also to save money to reinvest in the rest of the defence portfolio. There were 28 tier 1 activities identified, 27 of which are now completed. Savings of well beyond $40 million a year will be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>

With respect to the latter group, at the end of last year some 82,000 people were estimated to be in Australia illegally, having overstayed their visas.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does this mean the government is planning to further amend its already discredited budget of betrayal to lessen the devastating effect that the increase in fuel excise will have on our shipping, road and rail transport industries?</PARA>
<PARA>On 7 September Senator Collins replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing I wish to add to what I said about this yesterday, except to point out that it is not the shipping industry's fuel oil excise. Fuel oil is also extensively used for the generation of power in isolated communities, particularly in mining establishments. One of the most notable that I am aware of, which is in my backyard, is the Nabalco operation at Gove, which uses fuel oil for that purpose. So it is not simply the shipping industry that uses fuel.</PARA>
<PARA>So three weeks ago Senator Collins said it was under consideration and the next day he acknowledged that Nabalco, in his own backyard, in his own electorate, in his own very special consideration, was being looked at. Yet, today he whispered in Senator McMullan's ear and, like Pontius Pilate, Senator McMullan said nothing, got away with it, admitted to nothing that has happened in the way of government in the last three weeks and did not address the issues that really do stand out. What representations has Senator Collins made in cabinet, and elsewhere, if he really does represent the Northern Territory that he so proudly claims to represent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really important questions that have to be addressed in this issue that Senator McMullan failed to address in answer to my question today are: how could a Treasurer have made such a gross error, unfairly discriminating against one firm in an important export industry&mdash;$25 million for one company by one decision? To what extent does this compound the problem of sovereign risk for international investors in Australia? This is an extremely serious problem. No international investor in the mining sector can now look to this government without knowing that with a slash of a Treasurer's pen, new taxes will be put on in the order of $25 million. What confidence does that give in this particular area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was attracted to a statement by Nabalco that the new budget impost cannot help but emphasise the heightened sovereign risk of investing in mining and minerals processing in Australia. That is significant. It cannot be passed on, in an instance like this, to international consumers. Nabalco pays two-thirds of all excise on inland consumption of this nature. What are the long-term prospects for future investment, future earnings and job security in a place like Nabalco? Certainly we cannot continue to rely on the ERA just as we have in the past. Senator McMullan failed to address these issues substantively today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other point I want to make is that we do get a constant stream of people&mdash;and it would be very unusual if we did not&mdash;coming in concerned about the impact of tax increases on their particular business. In all the time I have been in public life, no-one has ever come to me to say, `Thank you very much for the significant improvement, for the reduction in taxes'&mdash;the fact that the corporate tax rate has gone down from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, for example, which has a significant effect on every company running a profitable business in Australia. None of them like to factor that into their equation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to support the comments made by my colleague Senator Tambling in response to the answer given by Senator McMullan. I think it is unfortunate that we did not get a response because in raising this matter&mdash;far from performing a stunt, far from play acting&mdash;my colleague Senator Tambling expressed concern about the impact of a 50 per cent increase in excise, rising to 90 per cent, and the impact that it will have on the mining industry and on coastal shipping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question had particular relevance to one company in the Northern Territory, Nabalco&mdash;a company the Asian headquarters of which this government pleaded to have transferred to Australia, and a company that is owned by the AMP. So AMP policyholders around Australia will be affected by this decision, but there was no consultation. It was a targeted increase. It will have a tremendous impact on the profitability of this particular country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, surprisingly, it is running against the thrust of what this government is arguing at present. It is pleading with Australian industry to get out there and to add value. This will hit this industry which is adding value. It is a major export earner in Australia, and yet this government is hitting it with an increase in tax which will rise by $25 million to $50 million from a previous threshold of $25 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase also will have special implications for Tasmania. My colleague from Tasmania Senator Sherry is already aware of the difficulties that that state will face. It will have consequences for industries such as Timco, Savage River Mines, Pasminco and Comalco. Why will it mean special problems for Tasmania? Firstly, there is the state's dependence on coastal shipping. The increase in fuel oil will have a tremendous impact on costs over there. Diesel fuel increases will add something like $3 to the cost of a basket of groceries in our particular state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from that, the long-term implications will be very severe. The government has not thought out the loss of employment and the loss of investment that will result from this increase. My colleague Senator Tambling indicated the problems of sovereign risk. This increase will further erode overseas investor perceptions about the stability of investing in Australia. It will heighten what is known as sovereign risk for people who are investing in this country, particularly in the mineral processing and mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase will have a tremendous effect on Nabalco. It will erode a lot of the competitive advantages that that company had over its competitors in Australia. Aluminium processing is not particularly profitable because of the world recession and this will further reduce the return to the investors, including CSR and the AMP. The government should realise that the present return on investment is quite minimal; it is just over one per cent. This increase is a further target on this industry which will further erode that minuscule return. Apart from that, it is the largest inland user of fuel oil. How will we encourage industries to move out of the coastal belt, to go inland and to develop this country if we are going to target them with premeditated increases such as this one?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that aluminium is one of Australia's largest and most successful export commodities. Here is targeting of a particular company resulting in its reduced profitability. What effect will that have on future investment? The partners have shown a remarkable confidence in this company by investing in it&mdash;putting more money into it. This will certainly jeopardise the money to be put into this company in the future. The problem is that the elasticity of demand for fuel oil is low. The government's decision is short-sighted. It places further future investment in jeopardy. I ask honourable senators to consider the impact, not only on future investment, but also on Australia's balance of payments, because that will be eroded. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

That does not excuse him for the answer that he gave because he should have been aware of it in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton. My question was very simple and straightforward. It referred to the heads of agreement between the ACTU and the government. Although it was dated 1 September this year, it referred to what now appears to be an agreement that was put in place prior to the last election. It certainly has been referred to as such by Ms Jennie George and by Mr George Campbell in recent days. In fact, this week, Jennie George said that the government should stop pussyfooting around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise two points in relation to this document. The first is minimum standard provisions and the emphasis that ILO conventions will be used. It is quite obvious from this document that that is not correct. It totally misleads the Australian parliament. There has been little or no negotiation with the employer side of the equation in terms of the direction that industrial relations in this country should take over the next decade; it has all been one-sided. The last sentence in point 3 of this document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the Accord, awards will provide the safety net of wages and conditions; bargaining above that safety net would occur through the negotiation of certified agreements (or overawards).</PARA>
<PARA>I want to emphasise the phrase `or overawards'. That means that the industrial relations clock in Australia is being turned back in terms of enterprise agreements and Australia getting a more competitive, flexible industrial system. It is also clear proof that the ACTU is running the government's agenda on industrial relations; hence my comments on what has occurred over the last two or three days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to take into consideration the viewpoints of others in the community, whether they belong to a union or not and whether they are employers or employees. Right now this debate is totally one-sided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to refer to in this document&mdash;no doubt we will come back to it time and again, as will Mr Brereton as he is called to appear before his masters at the ACTU from time to time&mdash;relates to the proposals that deal with secondary boycotts, common law and civil action. I want to highlight the proposition that, following the transfer of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act to the Industrial Relations Act, there must be a period of 72 hours before an employer who is being held to ransom or boycotted can seek to get a certificate from the Industrial Relations Commission in order to take some action. That is spelt out very clearly in point 30. That is purely and simply a legal licence to damage&mdash;something that has never been in Australian law before. It is disgraceful that this government should even be contemplating going down that track. In 1984 and 1987 it tried to remove sections 45D and 45E. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by my colleague Senator Crane to take note of the answer given by Senator McMullan in question time today. Today Senator Minchin used a very devastating phrase, which I think bears repeating in this chamber. He said, `We have a government by the unions, for the unions'. That is precisely what the document that Senator Crane tabled today is all about. It demonstrates once and for all the nature of the government that runs this country&mdash;and who is, in fact, running that government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an appalling document. It is appalling for a number of reasons: firstly, because it was concocted in secret between the Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, and the ACTU; and, secondly, because of the nature of the agreements which have been reached. These agreements are far-reaching and will substantially change the nature of labour market relations in this country and buttress further the power and privilege of the ACTU and the mega-unions which this government has helped create in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add to what my colleague Senator Crane said, it is interesting to consider the far-reaching nature of this document which has been revealed to the Senate today. A new industrial relations court is to be established. The old AIRC will be abolished and a new industrial relations court will be established. It also raises, in an intriguing way, the fact that the government is backing away, as a result of what it sees as a ruling from the ILO, from the 10,000 member rule for unions. I suggest to Senator Bell that that leaves him in a particularly awkward circumstance. Senator Bell and his colleagues stood up in this parliament barely 12 months ago&mdash;maybe a bit longer&mdash;and argued strongly for the support of the ACTU Labor government proposal for the creation of mega-unions.

Of course, now the government is backing away from that. So where does that leave the Australian Democrats policy? I put it to Senator Bell that it is a very good lesson for him and his colleagues now that the government is discussing these issues with the trade unions. It will leave the Democrats like a shag on a rock, like they have been left as a result of this particular in principle agreement between the ACTU and Minister Brereton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Crane has said, the document indicates that there will be major changes in relation to the secondary boycott issues; there will be major changes in relation to the legislative arrangements for ILO conventions. As a nationalist in this chamber, I am very opposed to the involvement of international law in domestic disputes in this country. I would have thought that, as there has been a bit of the old republican push on the other side, those opposite would also be a bit opposed to the involvement of international law in the legal system of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we pick up a Labor document these days, we find the ILO or the UN being involved in Australian domestic circumstances. That is a very bad trend in this country. Of course, in order to conduct civilised relations between nations, we need international law and we need it to be observed. But it is far better in a democracy that, when we are concerned about relations between people in our own country, we rely on our own legal processes and our own laws. One of the most disturbing features of this so-called republican push is the desire of the Labor Party to further entangle us in international and UN conventions, and this document once again proves that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to comment on the fairly predictable contributions which have been made, particularly those of Senator Crane. I want to deal with a couple of themes that were developed. I do not want to deal so much with the contents of the document that Senator Crane tabled, which is apparently dated 1 September&mdash;and I have seen the document. But I want to deal with the allegations of lack of consultation and concoctions in secret.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it a bit galling that Senator Crane alleges that there was little or no consultation with employers. Firstly, I make the point that there has been ongoing consultation with employers by the current minister and the previous minister, Senator Cook, who was a very good minister, although I know Senator Crane will contest that. They had a well developed, personal and ongoing combative relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit rich when the opposition comes in here claiming that we lack consultation. When did the opposition consult with the trade union movement about the contents of Fightback? I remind the Senate and the people of Australia that the opposition has not withdrawn its industrial relations policy in Fightback. It has withdrawn the GST because it believes that that was critical in its defeat. The opposition should also have a look at its industrial relations policy, because that was pretty critical in its defeat as well. It is a bit rich for opposition members to be saying that we do not consult&mdash;we do&mdash;when they do not consult themselves. If members of the opposition want to push that principle, it should apply just as much to them as it does to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane&mdash;this brought a wry smile to my lips&mdash;accused the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), of calling his masters in the ACTU. I have had a number of conversations and meetings with the minister on a range of matters over the last six months. Every time I pick up a newspaper there is generally criticism of him from a full range of the industrial movement. He has been criticised on a number of occasions by a number of unions. How can Senator Crane possibly claim that the unions are his master when they are criticising him for his alleged lack of action in a number of areas? Again, it is a total inconsistency in Senator Crane's assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted the other day that one of the employer organisations&mdash;I think it was the Chamber of Manufactures; I could be wrong&mdash;praised Minister Brereton for standing up to the ACTU. Whether that praise was justified or not, an employer organisation praised the minister. In fact, it requested the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to continue to support Minister Brereton in his approach in resisting some of the claims of the trade unions, which Senator Crane alleges are his masters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is this: Minister Brereton is in a very difficult position. He is undertaking a very difficult set of negotiations with both employers and trade unions. Minister Brereton should be praised by the Senate&mdash;he is certainly going to be praised by me&mdash;for the unstinting efforts he has made over the last six months to engage in the maximum consultation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other point that I will comment on very briefly is Senator Kemp's point about the minimum size of unions and adopting ILO conventions. We are consistent. There is a ruling through the ILO that our current legislation and policy is not consistent with ILO conventions. We will be respecting that, just as we will be introducing, I hope, legislation to respect ILO conventions in a number of other areas which establish very important minimum sets of wages and conditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important report that should engage the Senate with a great deal of consideration in the next few months. The Auditor-General has highlighted in audit report No. 6 of 1993-94 a whole range of aspects relating to Commonwealth-state agreements. I note in the forward to the report this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commentary is not based on any particular audit, rather it draws on the collective experiences of the ANAO in auditing such agreements over recent years and comments made on specific issues by State Auditors-General and central Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to concentrate on three of the nine key points made by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the ANAO has encountered circumstances where its powers to conduct efficiency audits under the Audit Act 1901 are ineffectual. Secondly, a broader range of sanctions is required to more effectively deal with instances of non-compliance with the terms of agreements. Thirdly, progress on the development of performance indicators and targets is less than satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I have highlighted those three points, I am not saying that the other six points that are identified as key issues by the Auditor-General do not deserve equal attention by other senators. In looking at the various points that the Auditor-General raised, I think it is important, when talking about Commonwealth and state relations, to focus on effectiveness. This is highlighted by those three particular points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is very comprehensive. It takes us through the various histories of a range of issues and the appropriateness of arrangements between the Commonwealth and various state governments. It also comments in detail on the various audits that are currently being conducted by the ANAO and on some arrangements that are internal. I note the comment that is made on page 19, point 2.58. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internal audit coverage, both at Commonwealth and State levels, has been observed in many cases to be inadequate or even non-existent.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty damning comment to which I think each and every Commonwealth department and agency must give particular attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My emphasis comes from the interest I have in my portfolio area of housing. I note that in the concluding remarks on page 26 at paragraph 3.11, Mr Taylor, the Auditor-General, commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One aspect that is frequently overlooked by departments and agencies is the need for clear identification, measurement and reporting of Commonwealth obligations or exposure under the agreement. In the case of housing, for example, data currently available to the department is insufficient to determine both the true levels of subsidies provided under the various housing assistance schemes and the overall exposure of the Commonwealth under its obligations to meet any shortfalls in the operation of those schemes. When reviewing performance indicators and information requirements, agencies should examine whether further improvements in these areas are possible.</PARA>
<PARA>Again that is a damning indictment. After a decade of administration by a Labor Government in Australia, we have reached the point where the very crux and key issue of housing, which is fundamental to many people in Australia, has received such a damning report. I would have thought that the emphasis of any minister for housing&mdash;particularly as the Deputy Prime Minister takes responsibility for this important portfolio himself&mdash;would be such that we would see less of the sort of trenchant criticism that is now being expressed by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report was tabled today. Recently the Auditor-General gave a different view in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 1 1993-94</EMPHASIS>. I refer in particular to volume 6 which addressed the issues of the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services portfolio. In that report again the Auditor-General's comments in the area of housing and planning were very scary&mdash;I think that is the appropriate way to describe it&mdash;and drew attention to a range of issues and agreements between the Commonwealth government and the state governments that needed to be addressed in the performance of the Commonwealth-state agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the opportunity to raise these issues in Senate Estimates Committee C on Friday 3 September this year. I raised the matter and put different points. In particular, I draw the Senate's attention to the comments of the Secretary of the department in responding to some of my questions. On that occasion, Mr Cole, the secretary of the department, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the Auditor-General&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was looking at the record over a number of years and essentially found that the conditionality that is imposed on Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement moneys to the states has not been correctly supervised; that reports from the states which were not lodged on the due dates were not pursued as assiduously as they ought to have been; that when they came in a form that was not precisely the form that the Commonwealth had asked for there was not a lot of follow-up action; that some of the phrases in the conditionality were open to more than one interpretation; that no negotiated interpretation had been arrived at and promulgated to the states; and that no unilateral attempt at better defining that conditionality had been made by the Commonwealth either.</PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO formed the opinion that the department has tended in the past to undermanage the CSHA, that there remains scope for further enhancement to the agreement and the manner in which it is administered, and that until recently there was little focus on the performance monitoring and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>The issues that the Auditor-General, and now the secretary of the department, have acknowledged bring us back to the point of asking `Where is housing in Australia, and what rules, regulations and arrangements between the Commonwealth department have been put in place?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also concerned to find, at the estimates hearings on 3 September, that when we walked the department through a number of the issues that had been raised with them by the Auditor-General, the department had not responded with any degree of urgency. In fact, whilst it had been aware that many of these issues had been on the agenda and had been looked at for some time, it had not addressed them properly. For example, in one of the questions I raised, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have there been any proposals to change the resources in this area to meet with the requirements and the recommendations of the auditor's report?</PARA>
<PARA>The response from a Mr Johnston, a departmental officer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been discussions within the division about reallocation of staffing to address these particular concerns. At the same time, negotiations are under way with the states, through the working parties that I mentioned, to develop the mechanisms to improve the timing of receipt of this information.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on Mr Johnston acknowledged this, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also the question of information flow from the states, and there have certainly been many occasions when the department has vigorously pursued the states for information and it has still taken considerable time to receive that information. As the Auditor-General notes, there have been other occasions where we have not been diligent in pursuing the information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a direct acknowledgment by a Commonwealth departmental official at a senior level that the issues relating to housing have not received the degree of priority and acknowledgment that should be in place. In the Auditor-General's general portfolio report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 1</EMPHASIS>, and now in the specific report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An audit commentary on aspects of Commonwealth-State agreements</EMPHASIS>, the issue is again drawn to our attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for particular emphasis and priority to be placed on this issue by the government. We must not get to the stage where we arrive at Senate estimates early next year, or perhaps at this time next year, when I stand and ask these same questions of either the minister or the officials and receive the same priority. The funding allocation, the billions of dollars of Commonwealth money that is injected into housing, is an important issue to people in Australia needing housing&mdash;particularly those requiring welfare and Aboriginal housing. It is equally important to the construction industry and to the employment prospects throughout Australia. If the government is going to walk away and not acknowledge any of the issues that are put under its nose by an Auditor-General on matters as important as these, then we are in desperate and dire straits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Tambling, I would like to point out just how timely this report is. Perhaps my perspective is, however, a little different. I am concerned about the issues that have been raised in this report and I think we should begin from the presumption that most Commonwealth programs are well managed and that the funds are allocated in accordance with the terms of agreements entered into by states. Of course, they are carefully monitored and there is very strong public accountability for the Commonwealth's use of those funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem, however, goes much deeper than just the Commonwealth of Australia and this government. It relates to the other part of the partnership, which is, of course, the states. What this report relies upon and draws attention to is the need for clearly defined roles and responsibilities of the respective parties, the inclusion of incentives to identify and harness administrative efficiencies, the introduction and ongoing refinement of program planning, performance indicators and performance targets and the ability of an escalating range of sanctions to address non-compliance with the terms of agreements and the establishment of appropriate accountability mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is exactly that question of non-compliance that I am concerned about. Like Senator Tambling, I raised these matters before an estimates committee. I am particularly concerned about the question of substitution where we have a number of conservative governments across this country undertaking savage budgetary cuts which are decimating national programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of Victoria, massive budget cuts are being undertaken, particularly in the area of education. This is an area of concern that the Commonwealth government shares, not just the Auditor-General. Back in May the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) wrote to the Victorian Minister for Education, Mr Hayward, asking about this very issue of substitution. It took until September for a reply to be given by the Victorian Minister, Minister Hayward, on the issue of whether or not the moneys that had been allocated to Victoria for educational purposes were being spent in accordance with the agreements entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that $310 million is provided by the Commonwealth to Victoria for a range of recurrent, capital and targeted programs. These fundings are designed to supplement state funding, not to replace state funding, which is the point that many conservative politicians have failed to realise. They have the notion that somehow or other budget cuts are something they impose on Labor constituencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing that again and again in Victoria, particularly in the area of education. In the north-west region of Melbourne some 51 per cent of the schools are disadvantaged, but one finds that the major cuts and closures to schools programs are occurring in those regions. One has to ask: how can the Commonwealth stand by and allow that to happen?  That is exactly the question that I asked officials before the estimates committee. What is happening to Commonwealth money in Victoria? The minister replied that the Commonwealth officials were somewhat reluctant to give that information. I trust that we will be able to establish clearly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also asks about this matter. The report states that in practice, the Australian National Audit Office has noted a reluctance on the part of Commonwealth agencies to invoke the various sanction powers that are available when non-compliance has been detected. What is the problem with that? Essentially it gives the impression that the Commonwealth is not prepared to follow through with implementation agreements; it gives the impression that the Commonwealth is prepared to turn a blind eye to non-compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the question again: what is the accountability? The Auditor-General asks that same question. There has to be a mechanism whereby public money is directed to specified purposes. Section 96 of the constitution lays down quite clearly what the Commonwealth is able to do; that is, to make grants on such terms and conditions as the parliament sees fit for specified purposes. In my view, direct grants to the states should become more common. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of education is there any concern in Victoria, apart from the obvious fact that over 200 schools are about to close? Is there any concern that this might have an impact on the $310 million that is allocated for various national equity programs?  Of course there is. It is not just a political concern raised by the fact that one is seeing schools close, railway lines cut as well as cuts to state housing which have a direct bearing on national programs and various other measures undertaken by state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the question of national equity programs. In July the Directorate of School Education in Victoria distributed a discussion paper on the way in which national equity program funds should be distributed. This is a paper, I might add, that the Commonwealth officials did not seem to be able to get hold of, but which is available to those who have some familiarity with the industry in Victoria. This paper spells out the way in which money should be allocated across the schools system in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has to be viewed in the context of a state government program that says there should be increasing attention for school funding to the local area. On the one hand, we have a national program attempting to distribute moneys at a state level; on the other hand, we have a state program distributing moneys at a local level. Of course, this is where the problem arises. The Auditor-General points out that the real problem is being able to get into the state systems because of the various secrecy provisions and protocols of Commonwealth-State relations. This means that at either end we cannot identify where the money is going from Commonwealth sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Auditor-General or Labor politicians who have expressed concern; it is also the Victorian Government's own bureaucrats. We have, for instance, the response to the discussion paper by Russell Collier, General Manager of the North West Metropolitan Region in Melbourne. That region is the largest in the education system in Victoria and has within it 143 disadvantaged schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on the guidelines that have been circulated on the way in which national equity funds should be spent, Mr Collier says that he is particularly concerned about the way in which there would be identified target indicators. He queries whether national equity fund programs for schools will be in addition to school grants or whether they will just be wrapped up with all of them. The question of accountability arises again. Mr Collier also asks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which of the elements will have a school targeted focus? . . . Further, which processes are intended to be used if the interchange of funds were to be adopted?  The Region&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the North West Metropolitan Region&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be most concerned if funds from the Literacy and Numeracy and Disadvantaged Schools elements were arbitrarily allocated to the Country Education element.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior officials are expressing their concerns saying that there are real worries about the way in which there will be reporting and accountability of national moneys. I share with Senator Tambling a grave concern, but I do so from a completely different point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial arrangements for reporting need to be tightened up. There needs to be much closer scrutiny of the way in which the states spend money. When Minister Hayward, for instance, does reply to the Commonwealth, he should give those assurances and not just glibly dismiss them by saying, `Of course there are to be no cuts to the Commonwealth's funding'. What we are concerned about is the question of whether or not state funds will be cut and whether or not there will be substitution; that is, Commonwealth moneys being used to make up for state cuts. This is where we are having some real difficulties getting to the nub of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the states report annually through the Australian national report on schools in Australia under the guidance of the Australian Education Council, which is composed of state and federal ministers. This is particularly important in the case of Victoria because of the concerns I have expressed here today. New guidelines will be required. The states will be required to sign new agreements in terms of access, participation and attainment with regard to education. They also will be required to provide evidence that disadvantaged schools and disadvantaged students are actually getting the extra help that is provided by the Commonwealth. This is a matter of deep concern where we are finding some 200 schools closing in the state of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, we have a need for the Commonwealth to ensure that those programs are followed through and that the new agreements that the Commonwealth is seeking are honoured. An unfortunate situation has arisen. The Auditor-General has identified real problems which I believe should be addressed by the national government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of education, I believe that the minister is already moving in that direction. However, it is important for Commonwealth officers to appreciate, as is highlighted in the audit report, that its responsibility is to the national government and not necessarily primarily to state officials. When I talk to officials in various government offices I sometimes get the impression that their responsibility is to each other. They have more in common with the bureaucracy at various levels than they do with the political directions set by this parliament. I would urge this parliament to take particular note of the report. I hope that the government takes these matters up very quickly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1991 the committee requested the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to provide terms of reference for an inquiry examining Australia's relationship with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, highlighting those aspects of Australia's relationship with the World Bank and the fund which would be in Australia's long-term economic and trade interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference was advertised in national and capital city newspapers in November 1991 and the trade subcommittee of the joint committee, chaired at that time by Mr John Langmore MP, conducted public hearings in Canberra during May, August and September 1992. A further public hearing, chaired by the Hon. John Kerin MP, was held in Canberra in July 1993. In total, 76 submissions and 101 exhibits were received during the course of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For countries like Australia, membership of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund offers both the potential to influence their policies and the opportunity to export Australian goods and services to developing countries under their programs. Regrettably, to date Australia has not always been able to capitalise on the opportunities offered by that membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its 1989 report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Third World debt: an Australian view</EMPHASIS>, the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade examined the impact of multilateral development bank adjustment programs on the poor in developing countries. The committee recognised that the primary responsibility for action lies with recipient country governments because the impact of multilateral development bank loans on poverty depends on the policies of recipient governments. However, the World Bank and the IMF have the ability to encourage those recipient governments to increase the priority accorded to poverty reduction through their country assistance strategies and their loan conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that report of the committee was published in 1989, the World Bank has accepted that the need to address sectoral issues is a necessary adjunct to its policy of growth through structural adjustment. While acknowledging that the bank is attempting to deal with these issues, many witnesses and other commentators considered that the change in actual policies has been inadequate and have called on Australia to play a more active role in influencing both bank and IMF policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particular areas of concern addressed by witnesses to the inquiry were: the failure of the bank and fund to lead a process of major debt reduction for severely indebted countries; the social problems created by the current focus of both the bank and fund on structural adjustment loans; the failure of the bank and fund to address cross-sectoral issues such as unemployment, inequity, poverty, population, growth, land redistribution and environmental issues in developing countries; the failure of the bank to learn from its mistakes through program evaluation; and, finally, the dominance of the fund and bank by industrialised countries with a particular narrow and naively theoretical philosophy of unconstrained markets, regardless of the extent of market failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that membership of the World Bank and the IMF has a five-fold benefit to Australia. It provides the opportunity to participate as an active member of the international economic and financial system and to influence the policies of the MDBs to ensure that effective and equitable development policies are implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Membership also provides opportunities, on the regional level, for Australia to encourage bank and fund involvement in South East Asia and the South Pacific, thereby enhancing our regional bilateral development programs. Australia is also able to participate in the development debate in our region through the World Bank's research into the economies of the South Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Involvement in bank financed business opportunities can help Australian firms in becoming established in serving export markets in developing countries, including the Asian region. From a trade perspective, therefore, the primary benefit to be gained from Australia's membership lies in the opportunity to participate in the procurement of goods and services, particularly in areas where Australia has comparative advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relative terms Australian service providers perform better than our manufacturers. There are a number of reasons for this, not least of which is Australia's technical excellence in the fields demanded by the bank and the approach taken by service providers when tendering for bank projects. Evidence presented to the committee indicates that this is not the case for manufacturers and that considerable work remains to be done to improve the knowledge of Australian firms about the procurement process. Greater advantage should also be taken of opportunities offered through co-financing arrangements between the Australian government and the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of publicly available information about World Bank and IMF activities and consultation over issues affecting Australia was a recurring theme throughout evidence taken during the course of this inquiry. The executive directors of Australia's constituencies in the bank and in the IMF hold positions of influence because they are conduits between the Australian government, other members of our constituency and the executive boards. While limited consultation exists between the Treasury, non-government organisations and interested departments, evidence presented to the committee indicates that this is quite inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is of the view that neither the cabinet nor the parliament are adequately apprised of issues affecting Australia and, as a consequence, believes that much wider consultation is required. Therefore, the committee recommends the establishment of an advisory council on international development whose role would be to monitor bank and fund activities and to brief relevant non-government organisations, departments and the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the World Bank announced the proposed establishment of a public information centre to provide information on project procurement opportunities, appraisal and evaluation reports, environmental assessments, country economic and sector reports and policy papers. Unfortunately, the IMF is not as forthcoming with information about its activities, particularly in relation to issues affecting Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the committee believes that the Treasurer should incorporate details of the fund's article IV consultations and the voting patterns taken by Australia on decisions made with the executive boards of both the bank and fund within his annual report to the parliament on the operations of the bank and the IMF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern was expressed to the committee about the substantial increase in the proportion of Australia's aid program which is now taken up by our contributions to the MDBs and the fact that further real aid cuts without substantial reductions in those made to the multilateral development banks would lead to further distortions. This concern is particularly valid, given the increased demand for bank and IMF resources to assist Eastern Europe, the former states of the Soviet Union and Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1984-85 the multilateral development banks have been protected from 15 per cent real cuts faced by the aid program as a whole. In contrast to the rest of the program, World Bank contributions have increased by 31 per cent in real terms. The committee believes that multilateral aid should be a separate component of the aid budget and that a special mechanism should be established for dealing with MDB contributions so that payment does not take pockets of money out of the bilateral aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the committee is still concerned about the monopoly held by Treasury on positions of executive director to the multilateral development banks. This practice was criticised by this committee in its 1989 report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and Australia's overseas aid program</EMPHASIS>. In that report, the committee recommended that Australia's executive director and alternate director positions be filled on the basis of expertise in development and development finance issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence to the current inquiry, the Secretary to the Treasury said that it has now become standard practice for vacancies in these positions to be advertised outside the department. The committee commends Treasury for following this course when filling the recent vacancy for the position of Executive Director to the IMF. However, concern still exists that the selection process is still weighted in favour of officers with experience more relevant to Treasury's internal requirements on occasion. Therefore, the committee reiterates its earlier recommendation that the expertise in development and development finance issues be an essential criterion for selection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the committee in both the 36th and 37th parliaments for all the time and effort spent on this inquiry, in particular the chairmen, Mr Langmore and Mr Kerin. I know that Mr Sinclair and Senator Beahan had a particular interest, as did Senator Harradine.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw attention to only three aspects of the report. The report goes much wider than that and covers a lot of things I would like to comment on but will not have time to. Firstly, I would like to address the concern that our involvement with multilateral development banks is at the expense of our bilateral aid program. The concern is sharpened by the belief of many&mdash;and I share the view&mdash;that bilateral aid is more effective in terms of Australia's control over programs&mdash;their relevance, effectiveness and sustainability&mdash;and in meeting our strategic, political, social and humanitarian objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also concern that in times of understandable fiscal restraint, contributions to multilateral development banks have risen in real terms. For example, since 1984-85 contributions to the World Bank have increased by 31 per cent. What this effectively means is a real-term reduction in bilateral aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern is also expressed at Treasury's insistence on the bracketing of multilateral and bilateral outlays. What this means effectively is that it is always difficult to ascertain just how the aid budget is being disbursed. Treasury's argument in support of this bracketing is, I believe, shallow. Like so much of what it does, Treasury seems to be more concerned with obfuscation than with enlightenment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends at recommendation 5, therefore, that multilateral and bilateral aid should be separate components of the aid budget, that there should be transparency and that there should be a special mechanism to ensure that payments to multilateral development banks do not draw funds away from the bilateral aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect I would like to draw attention to&mdash;Senator Loosley has already adverted to it&mdash;is the question of structural adjustment loans and concerns about their impact on poverty. There has been widespread concern, particularly through the 1980s, about the impact of structural adjustment loans. They are loans to developing countries to assist in coping with debt, but loans which are given on conditions that the recipient countries adopt monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies designed to rectify their external indebtedness. There is concern that the conditions that have been set have had unacceptably harsh effects on the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is conceded that the major cause of poverty in the countries concerned is the global and national economic situation, there is real concern, and some evidence to support that concern, that the adjustment policies that are forced on these countries have themselves been contributors to the poverty and hardship. An example of how this might occur is that the deflationary effects of bank and fund policies have often increased unemployment and decreased real wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rises in food prices have added to the problem of falling incomes. Food prices have frequently risen faster than other prices because subsidies have been discontinued, because of devaluation of currencies and because of deregulation of markets, all of which have been imposed as conditions of aid programs under the structural adjustment mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting here&mdash;and the Democrats and the Greens, who have become the new protectionists of the house, should note this&mdash;that the policies of developed countries can impact adversely on underdeveloped or developing countries. For example, the high level of agricultural protection in Europe, the USA and Japan has two impacts. Firstly, it means that the price of food is higher than it should be. The impact of this falls most heavily on low or fixed income earners so that, for example, in Japan rice costs seven times more to the Japanese than it would if they accepted imports because of the subsidies that are added to it. Of course, the impact of that is on the poorer sections of the community, not on the wealthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second impact is the subsidisation of production of commodities which the developing world is well placed to produce. Page 73 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Price suppression on the international market inflicts ever lower standards of living on the developing world.</PARA>
<PARA>The report notes that the bank has become more aware of the impact of its adjustment policies and is acting to alleviate their impact on the poor. But it notes also that the same cannot be said about the IMF. Recommendations 17 and 18 at page 81 urge the government to use its influence to increase the emphasis on poverty alleviation in structural adjustment policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I would like to look at the question of procurement and the degree to which Australian companies are sharing in the benefits which flow from our role as a reliable contributor to the bank and the fund, benefits such as the procurement of contracts for the provision of goods and services. It is only fair that Australia, as a reliable, consistent and, I might add, prompt contributor to the bank and the fund&mdash;this makes it unusual, I might say, among the supporters of those institutions&mdash;should enjoy a fair share of procurement. It applies not only to multilateral development banks but also to United Nations agencies&mdash;not that we looked at those in this report. It is also important because such participation can help Australian firms gain a foothold in potential export markets, particularly in the Asian region. They gain that foothold through getting contracts through multilateral agencies, establishing themselves in the countries concerned and later exporting to those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found it difficult to obtain an accurate picture of how well Australia does in gaining contracts. Statistics from the bank and other sources simply are not good enough. A number of studies have been done. Some of them throw some light on the question, but very few of them give any substantive evidence of just how we are going. Recommendations 7 and 8 at page 39 draw attention to the need for more resources to be devoted to the collection of procurement data and to the general gathering of statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some generalisations can be made, however. The first is that Australian service providers perform better than our manufacturers and there are some good reasons for that. The second is that a big proportion of Australian procurements are in the provision of raw materials. I guess there should be no surprise about that given the volume of raw materials that are exported from this country&mdash;over 30 per cent of our export activity. The third is that manufacturers do not appear to be doing as well, given the fact of course that manufacturing is a growing area here and now represents something like 29 per cent of our exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia's production mix changes and manufacturing assumes an increasingly important role, it will be equally important to ensure that manufacturers gain a share of these contracts. There is some evidence to suggest that Australian manufacturing companies are not up to speed in this area. There is, for example, a high level of non-compliance with tender requirements for bank projects reflecting, it seems, an ignorance on the part of manufacturers tendering for these projects of the processes they have to go through. There is a general hesitancy on the part of Australian companies to bid for contracts. That hesitancy seems to be backed by a lack of understanding of the bank processes, a lack of intelligence on what is going on within the bank and the need for the formation of consortia to allow small companies to participate in the tender process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations 9 to 20 of the report go to trying to find some solutions to these problems. They place considerable emphasis on the need for education and information for our manufacturing companies. They place considerable responsibility on Austrade and AIDAB as facilitators in this educative process. The report also recommended that Austrade and AIDAB investigate mechanisms such as business consultative groups to encourage the formation of consortia to bid for bank projects. Of course that is important, not only for the export trade but also because business can be a very good supporter of the need for higher levels of aid, which has a moral underpinning as well as an economic one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to note during the hearings that one of the witnesses&mdash;I have forgotten whether the witness was from the Metal Trades Industry Association or the Chamber of Manufactures&mdash;said that growth in the aid budget was in the interests of Australian business. This is how economic motivation can blend with the moral imperative of increasing our aid budget and, I think, result in a more humane approach to the whole question of aid by this country. I commend the report to honourable senators. It is a very detailed and technical, but very useful insight into what is, as I have said, a very mysterious and difficult area to understand. </PARA>

<PARA>I was not a member of the committee that presented a very detailed report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Midford Paramount case and related matters</EMPHASIS>. It was presented in the parliament in December 1992. It was a very detailed document that was scathing in its criticism of the Australian Customs Service and other departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minute that I have just tabled from the Department of Finance has been prepared on the basis of responses received from the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Department of Finance and the Attorney-General's Department. General comments are made in an appendix by the Attorney-General's Department, Australian Customs Service and the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, by way of background, although I am presenting the minute, I was not a member of the committee. My colleague Senator Bishop was a member of the committee. She has had a very strong involvement with this issue, so I will defer to her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee made 134 major recommendations. The report itself, as I indicated earlier, was a damning indictment of the Australian Customs Service and others. A number of charges were made by the Australian Customs Service. In the process of making those charges, which were unproven, innocent businesses and innocent people were destroyed. Their businesses were destroyed and they themselves suffered personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern, as brought out in estimates committee hearings by Senator Bishop&mdash;and I am sure she will pursue this with great vigour&mdash;was that of those 134 recommendations one was critical. If one believes in equity, fairness, probity and propriety in respect of government, one of those recommendations was very important. That recommendation was that the defendants in the Midford case be compensated for their unrecovered material and legal costs. As Senator Bishop found in the estimates committee in discussions with the Department of Finance, which leads an interdepartmental committee, that matter has not been resolved. It is now the end of September 1993. The committee's report was released in December 1992. We have responses to all recommendations except Nos 1, 3, 64, 76 and 77 which, as pointed out in the Finance minute, are policy matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of my colleague Senator Parer with the most enormous sense of sadness at the way the bureaucracy is reacting to this report. The report on the Midford Paramount affair was dealt with in a bipartisan way by the members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. We brought down a unanimous report saying that grave injustice had been done to these individuals. Yet, we find still within the bureaucracies concerned intransigence&mdash;a refusal to say that they were wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is this: this IDC mechanism has been allowed to drag on for so long that one could be forgiven for thinking that the bureaucracy has taken the view that the people concerned will be dead, bankrupt or both before it is forced to make a decision. I say `dead' not in a light way. There was evidence in the Midford hearings of one man who was put under so much pressure that he did, in fact, die. There is more evidence of a man who was once a bold, strong, strapping man at the beginning of the inquiry who is now constantly hospitalised; he is about half his former size and is a wreck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence of another man whose business was so destroyed that he wrote to us&mdash;indeed he has spoken to me in the last 48 hours&mdash;saying that, unless something is done to solve this impasse with this IDC committee, he will be bankrupt; he will have to close his business in the next five or six weeks. If the bureaucracy thinks it can beat the parliament and beat the public accounts committee by obfuscating, by taking evidence and continuing to refer, as it does, to a firm of accountants in a way that simply protracts the whole affair and holds it up, we will have people who are both dead and bankrupt&mdash;and the deaths and bankruptcies will weigh on the minds of those public servants who are responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the estimates committee hearing the other day the mood of both government and opposition senators was unanimous. The message to Finance was: `Get this matter resolved and get this compensation paid'. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has written to this IDC and told it: `Do not retry this matter. Do not retry the facts and judge culpability. That has been done by a committee of the parliament'. He said, `Just work out how much is to be paid'. As Senator Parer said, it is now nine months since that report came down. It is several weeks since we had that estimates committee hearing and still we have intransigence. I repeat that, if people either die or are forced into bankruptcy and ruination because of the deliberate obfuscation of the bureaucracy, a curse will remain upon their heads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice is what the committee wanted to see done in this matter&mdash;justice for people who were wronged and who had the might of the bureaucracy against them. They fought back and, despite the fact that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet tried to prevent evidence being given to the court which proved that the action against Midford and others was wrongful, the court had the wisdom to say that the evidence was to be made available. The evidence was, indeed, cabinet minutes. It was through raising the matter in parliament and getting former Senator Tate to authorise the release of those documents that, finally, the whole picture was there for people to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what we are seeing now is something that I can only describe as a wicked practice. The bureaucracy seems to have taken the attitude that, if it is forced to pay compensation, somehow this will be a precedent, that somehow it will be seen in a light that it does not want to be seen in. Well, tough!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was wrongful action that has destroyed the lives, reputations and livelihoods of ordinary Australians who came to this parliament for help. Through the committee we found them that help; we brought down a report; and the Prime Minister has told the Department of Finance and its IDC to say how much is to be paid. I say in this parliament today that that amount of money should be up and coming and paid forthwith. There should be no more delays, no more obfuscation. If it is not, it is tantamount to the bureaucracy acting in contempt of the parliament. I think those matters will have to be pursued; they are very serious. </PARA>

<PARA>The committee considering the powers, functions and operation of the Loan Council has to some extent been frustrated in that it has sought certain witnesses, some of whom are members of parliament and some are not, and some witnesses have chosen not to appear before the committee. In relation to those who are members of parliament, we have pursued an investigation as to how we may be able to get them before the committee. On the advice of the Clerk of the Senate, we are seeking in this report that the Senate pass a motion requesting the relevant houses in which these members of parliament sit to ask the relevant members of parliament to appear before our committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for choosing this course of action is that the powers of one of the houses of parliament in this country with respect to the powers of another house of parliament in this country are ill-defined when it comes to bringing witnesses before another house of parliament. Those powers are clearly defined with respect to the Senate calling members of the House of Representatives or vice versa, but not with respect to, say, the Senate calling a member of a state house. Therefore, it seemed appropriate that, in the first instance, the request for these people to appear before a Senate committee be made in that form&mdash;as a request from the Senate to the relevant house that those members appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be argued that we are seeking witnesses who will give evidence that may not greatly extend the evidence that has already been received. But I would point out that the Loan Council administers the borrowings of money in this country to the extent of tens of billions of dollars. We know that a number of the states have gone outside agreed limits&mdash;most recently in the case of Victoria, but not only in the case of Victoria. We know also from the evidence we have received so far that the way in which that Loan Council has been administered, the way in which determinations of amounts are made and the way in which decisions in relation to those amounts are made is secretive and certainly not open to the scrutiny that it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already had members of state parliaments come before us. We have had the former Premier of New South Wales and we have had the current Treasurer of Victoria. The evidence they have given indicates that we do need evidence from other members of state parliaments, treasurers and premiers to give a rounded picture of the operation of the Loan Council, because the recommendations which our committee will be able to make with respect to the better operation of the Loan Council will be very much in the broader interests of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think every member of the committee would agree that the operation of the Loan Council in the past has been totally unsatisfactory and very much in need of reform. Some reforms have occurred. I think the committee would take the view that further reforms are desirable and, in framing those further reforms, the evidence of other members of state parliaments would be desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the report to the Senate. I understand that at least one, possibly two, other members of the committee will want to make a few remarks; they have submitted a dissenting report. After they have spoken I</PARA>

I suspect they will not be very happy at the Senate attempting to lord it over the state parliaments, which is what is being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are good reasons for ending the state of farce that has existed with this committee. Firstly, there is the enormous cost to date of the operation of this committee. The second reason why this committee should finish its work&mdash;and I think it is a very important reason&mdash;is that the current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and government have already carried out reforms of the Loan Council. There has already been extensive reform of the operation of the Loan Council. Why are we continuing to waste public money inquiring into the way in which the Loan Council used to operate when, in fact, it has been extensively reformed, and evidence has been given that those reforms are of considerable value?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have reached the point where clear and ample evidence&mdash;quite sufficient evidence&mdash;has been put before the committee to reach a satisfactory conclusion about the various aspects of the Loan Council. It is a little ironic and a bit perverse that, two weeks before the last election, when we had not even heard from a third of the witnesses, we were handing down interim reports, criticising the Treasurer of this country, Mr Dawkins. We had heard such little evidence yet we were making recommendations two weeks before the election. Now, when we have heard so much evidence, we need more. There is a basic contradiction which is brought about by the fact that this committee is pursuing a political agenda, not a genuine inquiry&mdash;and I will have an opportunity to speak on the motion next week. That is not the purpose for which the committee was established. It is not the purpose of this Senate to pursue political partisan agendas when we should be examining, and have examined in sufficient detail, the operation of the Loan Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not had a chance to publicly debate in the Senate the procedures that we went through prior to the 13 March election. We had a state of high farce. Meetings were being held in airport terminals. A member of the committee who was ill in hospital was interviewed in his pyjamas. We had telephone votes&mdash;and we could not identify who was at the other end of the telephone.

I am afraid my hopes have been dashed by the determination of both the Liberal and Democrat members to continue to pursue a partisan political agenda. What are they attempting to do?

You are not going to appear'&mdash;not the independent Treasurer, our Mr Dawkins, except when he tries to tell the Senate that it has to deal with unconstitutional bills. Mr Dawkins was hiding behind the skirts of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, like a boy. This Senate is saying that that is not good enough. He has evidence that should be heard so that we can determine why it was that Mr Dawkins misled the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing we have been investigating is the way in which the Loan Council can best operate for the future, particularly taking into account the reforms or the changes that are being implemented. The one thing that is coming through loud and clear is that there does seem to be a little clique of people in the bureaucracy and they keep the mysteries of the Loan Council to themselves, when there should be far greater accountability and knowledge of how it works so that its function can be useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be honest, I thought that the evidence given by former Premier Nick Greiner was the most useful evidence we have heard to date. He explained in lucid, simple, easy to understand terms how he felt the Loan Council should operate, that we should effectively have a federal balance sheet so that we know precisely what is going on in the federal and state arena and so that we can make a sensible judgment about the way in which the needs of states and the Commonwealth can be served in terms of a loan agreement. So the committee has that dual function which I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The examination of how the Loan Council can best operate in the future is continuing. We are still hearing useful evidence. It will be worth while if we do nothing else but get rid of the mystique so that ordinary folk can understand the machinations of this little cell of people who share the information between themselves. We had the example of a former head of Treasury in Victoria writing to the head of Treasury in the federal arena and virtually telling him to go jump in the lake when he asked for information that related to how the Loan Council would operate. If we do nothing else but open it right up so that people understand the use and function of the Loan Council, this committee will have served that part of its purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be able to get to the bottom of whether or not there was collusion between people in the Victorian government and the federal government to prevent this information getting into the public arena because Mrs Kirner had an election to face&mdash;in other words, whether the proper processes of government were being subverted to a political process&mdash;unless we hear from the likes of Mr Dawkins, Mr Sheehan in particular, Mrs Kirner and Mr White. Mr Bannon could have a useful contribution to make all of his own. We might find out all sorts of things&mdash;like the things which were found out about the State Bank of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really serious point that does need to be addressed and the reason why the Senate is taking this serious step relates to the action of the Victorian Labor Party caucus. It had a little caucus meeting and it said to Mr Sheehan and Mrs Kirner and Mr White, `You will not appear before that committee because we, the Labor Party caucus'&mdash;the faceless men&mdash;`say you will not appear and give evidence'. It was not of their own volition but in a secret, closed meeting. I call the Labor Party caucus faceless men because they are generally not known to the Australian public. They are people who sit and determine that a former premier, a former treasurer and a former minister may not answer the call to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of a free country is this when a caucus can tell people they cannot appear before a committee? It is one thing for a Prime Minister to try to shield his inept Treasurer from making a fool of himself&mdash;or he thinks he will make a fool of himself&mdash;but it is quite another thing for the caucus to usurp the function of determining what information will go onto the public record and what will not. That is why this perfectly proper request is being dealt with today in the Senate. It is a question that will no doubt be resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the minority report, and to point out some of the inadequacies in the majority report, of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council which is before the Senate at the moment. I was interested to hear the remarks made by Senator Bishop. Perhaps those, more than any other, highlight just how inadequate this report is. As Senator Bishop indicated today, she has already made up her mind. She is very clear on what she believes has happened; she is absolutely certain about what is going on. Is it not a surprise that she found Nick Greiner's evidence the most useful of all, further reinforcing my belief that she has clearly made up her mind?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop is concerned about the Labor caucus. Again, that goes to the nub of the problem. She is very concerned that she is not in government, whereas nationally we are. She talks about the faceless people in Victoria. One of the reasons they are `faceless', or are not known nationally&mdash;despite the fact that they have been elected and despite the fact that they represent the people of Victoria in their constituencies&mdash;is that, unlike Senator Bishop, they do not spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money flipping around the country telling everybody about their interests in replacing Dr Hewson. The real faceless people are members of the campaign committee behind Senator Bishop in her attempts to replace Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, this Senate committee's agenda was spelt out very early in the piece&mdash;just before the last federal election. We only have to turn to the report put out just before the last federal election and look at clause 2.72, where the agenda is abundantly clear. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence so far has not revealed that the Treasurer acted to protect the Labor Government in Victoria against the advice of Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words `so far'. It is quite clear that in March the intention was to find the evidence. Since that time it has dredged Port Phillip Bay, running backwards and forwards and dragging around the bottom of the bay, and it has not been able to find the evidence that it said `so far' it was not able to reveal in March. It will not be able to find it if it continues this farce. Clause 2.72 of the original report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it remains an open question as to whether Treasury's advice was tailored to the understanding that the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, would not have compromised the Kirner Government in an election year, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA>The intention of this committee is quite obvious. It is not to conduct a proper and legitimate inquiry; it is to engage in a political witch-hunt and a campaign of slur. It is engaged in a campaign to try to snare Treasurer Dawkins with some claim that it has created in its own mind as to what occurred in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally inappropriate to continue with this farcical witch-hunt because a great deal of time has passed and a great deal of change has occurred. In late September yet another attempt is being made to drag out the work of this committee. The whole import of this proposal is to drag before the committee of this Senate members of other parliaments and to drag out the whole proceedings. One would have to question the motives behind that. What is the point? We have already gained quite extraordinary amounts of pertinent and relevant information. The committee has been conducting business for 11 months. It has held nine major public hearings. It has heard evidence from 46 expert witnesses from right across the spectrum of government in this country. It has already presented an interim report, where the majority of members have already stated their conclusions. They have already made up their minds. So what is the point of proceeding with this farce?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that Victoria is the opposition's target, despite the breaches that have occurred in New South Wales&mdash;for instance, the Sydney Harbour tunnel scheme. A number of other states, as Senator Coulter indicated, have breached the guidelines in a whole series of ways. The Opposition's target is Victoria. Its campaign is designed to attack its political opponents in Victoria. The device it is adopting is rather crude and, I might suggest, will rebound on it. I will come to that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has already been a general election in Victoria. We have already seen a change of government in that state. We have already seen changed circumstances in the way in which the government of that state is administering its relations with the Loan Council. Since that time we have seen, sadly, a further deterioration in the economic indicators in that state. We have already seen much greater borrowings in that state&mdash;an increase of $2.2 billion. We have seen an increase in unemployment. We have seen an increase in the level of debt. We have seen all these things. It is quite clear that the Opposition will not be able to hide that from the people of Victoria for too much longer. We have also seen that the secretaries of both the Victorian government Treasury and the Commonwealth government Treasury have changed in that time. The Loan Council operations themselves have changed dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is at the core of this issue is the debate about interpretation and terminology. We have seen plenty of evidence to suggest that there is a club operating at the Loan Council. There are questions of confidentiality and there are devices by which all governments come to arrangements to secure loan borrowings. There is no attempt in the Loan Council for anybody to sit down and say, `This is approved for a good purpose or a bad purpose'. When we questioned the present Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Stockdale, he indicated that he would resent quite strongly the notion that the Commonwealth government should at any point give any approval to funding borrowings and should have any role in the determination of what those borrowings are for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen quite important improvements already occurring in the way in which Loan Council operations are undertaken. We have had plenty of evidence to suggest just how effective those changes are. We are really talking about a witch-hunt. We are not talking about good administration of government and we are not talking about sound financial management. We are talking about a political witch-hunt; we are talking about trying to tar and feather people; and we are talking about dragging people before a committee of this chamber. Essentially, we are talking about trying to undermine the normal relationships between houses of parliament in this federation. It is important to bear that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no precedent for the action that is being proposed here&mdash;none at all. There is a general principle that has operated throughout the federation that houses of parliament have comity. There is this notion that we cannot mistreat members of parliament from another jurisdiction. We have this notion of privilege. The opposition is seeking to have privileges removed from the Labor members in Victoria. Woe betide the opposition because one day there will be another Labor government in Victoria. What will it say to the proposition of a Labor government there, using this precedent, calling Liberal members of the Senate before a state house in Victoria? That is clearly the precedent that the opposition is setting. It is clearly attempting to establish arrangements whereby members of this Senate can be called before state houses of parliament to assist with their inquiries, to use your good old copper's narks sort of language. That is precisely what this game is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not seem to appreciate just how serious a precedent it is setting. In effect, it is talking about revenge and the notion that we won an election which it thought it had in the bag. It has to try to use the powers of this parliament and the Senate in such a way as to attempt to undermine that government and basically make up for the fact that it lost an election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this report basically puts forward proposals which are unprecedented, incredibly dangerous and which in the end will not result in the good government of this country but establish a system of retribution, which will continue. There will be no time in which people can suggest that that will not occur because, quite clearly, there will be Labor majorities in state houses and they will reply in kind. And would not the opposition expect that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot honestly say that this committee has operated in any other way than in a partisan way. Why should not people be wary about being dragged before a committee which is operating in such a partisan way? Why should not people be concerned about being dragged before a jury that has already made up its mind? The opposition has demonstrated again today that that is clearly its intent. It has no intention of following a legitimate inquiry. The final report of this committee can now be written. There is no need to seek a further extension to this terrible farce. </PARA>

The real problem is with those witnesses who are former ministers, particularly, but not exclusively, of the former Labor government in Victoria, and who were party to loan arrangements or borrowing arrangements which breached, in a massive way&mdash;to the tune of $1.3 billion&mdash;the guidelines of the Australian Loan Council and therefore caused very considerable problems for the confidence and the integrity of Australia's financial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem arises because of former Premier Joan Kirner; former Treasurer, Tony Sheehan; and a former senior minister, the Hon.

But Tony Sheehan had indicated that he would appear. My advice is that he would like to appear, but he has been hobbled by the caucus in Victoria saying, `You're not to appear'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO.2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes amendments to a number of Acts within the Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services Portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of the bill amends Part II of the Disability Services Act 1986 and, although of a minor nature, will improve the professional administration of the Disability Services Program. It will do so in two ways. Firstly, the amendment to section 14J of the Disability Services Act 1986 will make it clear that a statement which the Minister is permitted to make under the section, regarding funded organisations' breaches of prescribed standards under the Act, will not become the subject of a defamation action nor will any person who fairly reports or summarises the statement be liable for defamation. This amendment restates the common law. The provisions should save litigation costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, where an organisation's assets are to be transferred to another person, transferees will be asked under section 16 of the Disability Services Act 1986, as a condition of approval, to sign agreements acknowledging the extent of any Commonwealth equity in the transferred land, buildings and equipment. This will place transferees in the same situation as the original grantee with respect to the protection of Commonwealth equity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973. The amendments in this Part correct anomalies arising from the passage of the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991. In general these amendments are of a minor technical and administrative nature and do not have any substantive effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 23DK extends the duty of responsibility for the keeping of relevant records to Approved Pathology Authorities who were the employers of an approved pathology practitioner at the time the service was rendered and the approved pathology practitioner is no longer employed by the approved pathology authority. It is impractical to require the approved pathology practitioner to continue to carry the responsibility for the retention of records, created at a time when he or she was in the employ of the approved pathology authority, after that employment has ceased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 23DNAA extends the exclusion of public authorities to include `joint ventures' between public authorities and private persons or corporations. Public authorities are funded through other arrangements. Without this amendment these `joint ventures' would be entitled to claim (additional) Medicare benefits as a private provider of pathology services. This is inconsistent with the intent of the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 23DNC provides for a review of determinations made in respect to the allocation of specimen collection licences in special circumstances. Under the existing provisions of the Health Insurance Act 1973 determinations made under this section are not subject to review and may remain in force at the discretion of the licensee. This amendment is to implement measures to ensure that determinations made for the granting of specimen collection licences in special circumstances remains for as long as those `special circumstances' continue to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the bill makes three amendments to the Hearing Services Act 1991. The first of these is to extend the definition of "eligible persons" to include holders of a "Dependent Treatment Entitlement Card". This will ensure that widows of veterans are adequately covered under this Act. The second and third amendments provides for the official symbol of Australian Hearing Services to be included within the protected symbol provisions of the Act and so prevent unauthorised use of the Authority's symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of the bill amends the National Health Act 1953. The amendment provides that a pharmacist who wishes to relocate a pharmacy must obtain approval in respect of the new premises, and that the Commonwealth cannot pay for pharmaceutical benefits which have been supplied from unapproved premises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions have been in the NHA for many years; however, prior to the passage of the pharmacy restructuring legislation in December 1990 they were not rigorously enforced, particularly in the case of comparatively short distance relocations.  In any case, approval of relocations was virtually automatic provided that the requirements of State law were met. As a result, it is suspected that a number of pharmacists have relocated their businesses without obtaining the necessary approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the advent of the pharmacy restructuring, it has become necessary to enforce these provisions. The pharmacy restructuring guidelines provide for different rules to apply depending on the distance of a relocation, and also the distance to the nearest pharmacy is a consideration in granting an approval of a pharmacist or the payment of an essential pharmacy allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some eight cases where a pharmacist had relocated without approval came to light during 1991/92. In these cases act of grace payments and/or waivers of recovery were approved by the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Commission now wishes to conduct a survey to establish with certainty the location of each approved pharmacist's premises. To ensure compliance with the survey by approved pharmacists, it wishes to assure them that they will not be penalised for unapproved relocations which occurred prior to the commencement of the pharmacy restructuring legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Finance considers it inappropriate to continue to use the act of grace and waiver powers to deal with what could be a large number of unapproved relocations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus to prevent an injustice in either seeking to recover moneys or to put a pharmacist out of business we are seeking to amend the NHA to deem as approved at their new premises those approved pharmacists who relocated without obtaining approval, prior to 18 December 1990 (the date of effect of legislation establishing the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 7 of the bill repeals subsection 25(2) and section 38 of the  Nursing Homes and Hostels Legislation Amendment Act 1986. These unproclaimed provisions relate to the regulation of government nursing homes under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974. With the transfer of responsibility for the regulation of nursing homes to the National Health Act 1953, the provisions are no longer needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 8 of the bill introduces a number of changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. Clauses 29(h), 30, 31 and 32 will amend the Principal Act to facilitate the introduction of complementary State and Territory legislation that will support the regulatory framework set up under the Commonwealth's therapeutic goods legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the objects of the Therapeutic Goods Act have been included to clarify the respective roles of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories in establishing a uniform national system of controls over therapeutic goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uniform regulation over the quality, efficacy and safety of therapeutic goods manufactured for supply and use in Australia cannot be achieved without the establishment of corresponding State and Territory laws that will adopt the Commonwealth's regulatory requirements in respect of appropriate standards, including manufacturing and advertising standards, for therapeutic goods. The States and Territories have agreed to set up complementary legislation to complement the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989. It is anticipated that state complementary legislation will be in place by as early as 1994. When this occurs, the amendments to the Principal Act dealing with complementary legislation will be activated by proclamation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 25 January 1993 Australia acceded to the Convention for the Mutual Recognition of Inspections in respect of the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. This convention allows for the mutual exchange of information on the manufacturing standards of manufacturers in the eighteen signatory nations. This will allow regulatory authorities in those countries to establish the acceptability of manufacturing standards and procedures used in the manufacture of imported pharmaceutical products without the need for overseas inspections to be undertaken by the importing country. Under this scheme export of Australian manufactured pharmaceutical products will be greatly enhanced. The inclusion of clauses 29(i), 37(b), 38(b), 47 and 50(d) will give effect to the convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act are necessary to clarify the application of the Act to goods such as first aid kits and other packs containing mixed products. Such kits fall within the definitions of `therapeutic goods' and `therapeutic use' already existing in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments make provision for the inclusion in the Register of kits, as a single entity, where the individual therapeutic goods contained in each kit have already been registered or listed in the Register. Provision is also made to enable a number of kits to be grouped together, as a `gazetted kits group', so that each kit may share a common listing number and sponsors of groups of kits need only pay one set of annual charges for maintaining listings of grouped kits in the Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposals have been discussed with companies supplying kits and the industry associations and have their agreement. Entry of kits on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods is necessary to enable complete traceability of therapeutic goods which are supplied either separately or in the kits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments included in Part 8 of this bill seek to clarify the meaning and operation of the Therapeutic Goods Act and to address problems that have surfaced since the Act came into operation two and a half years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The powers of the Secretary to declare goods exempt from the operation of the Act when labelled in a particular way is to be changed to close a potential loophole. Many goods may not qualify as therapeutic goods but for the way they are presented for supply. Therefore the Secretary may declare goods to be therapeutic goods where their presentation suggests any therapeutic use. At present sponsors could label their goods in a certain manner to avoid regulation, yet subsequently advertise or present their products as therapeutic goods. The amendment will preclude this from happening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of an `authorised person' is to be amended to make appropriately experienced members of the Australian Federal Police authorised persons for the purposes of Part 6 of the Principal Act. This will simplify administrative procedures when such officers are called upon to assist the Therapeutic Goods Administration with its investigations into breaches of the Principal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of manufacturing premises is to be amended to remove the restriction that such premises are to be confined to buildings on sites. This will allow manufacturing activities to be undertaken in places other than buildings, including mobile vans used for collecting blood plasma. Such places usually present no increased hazard to the products being manufactured, and should be permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment is required to enable an application fee to be charged for every application to add a new product into the Register, even though the new product comes within a gazetted therapeutic goods group. At present, sponsors of goods that fall within the description of a gazetted therapeutic goods group only pay one application fee to include all such products in the Register over a period of time. Agreement has been reached with industry on how the fee will apply and the levels of fee to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment is required to introduce a penalty for a sponsor who fails to provide information or who provides false or misleading information. This amendment addresses problems experienced by the Therapeutic Goods Administration in getting sponsors to provide information about the quality, safety or efficacy of therapeutic goods where there may be a concern over a product that has already been included in the Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Act provides that in the event of entry and search of premises, evidence of the commission of offences may only be held for sixty days before commencement of prosecution. Experience in the first two and a half years of operation of the Act is showing this timeframe to be too restrictive to allow for analysis or testing of goods, compiling of briefs, and laying of charges. This amendment will permit the Therapeutic Goods Administration to make application to a magistrate for an extension to this sixty day period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A related amendment will extend the 12 month period in which prosecutions for certain offences may be brought under the Act to two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to section 66 of the Principal Act will clarify the position that goods included in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods under the transitional arrangements, following the commencement of the Principal Act, may not necessarily have been evaluated or assessed. The transitional arrangements provided for a period of grace during which eligible sponsors of therapeutic goods could continue to supply unregistered and unlisted goods without committing an offence, whilst their goods were being included in the Register by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. Goods included in the Register as a result of transitional arrangements may nevertheless still be evaluated or assessed at a later date, to establish whether or not such goods should remain in the Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THERAPEUTIC GOODS (CHARGES) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take pleasure in introducing the Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Amendment Bill 1993 to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Therapeutic Goods (Charges) Act 1989 (the Principal Act) imposes annual charges on the registration and listing of therapeutic goods, and on the licensing of manufacturers of therapeutic goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes amendments to the Principal Act that complement simultaneous changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 that are introduced in Part 8 of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 8 of that amendment bill introduces a number of changes to the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 to facilitate the introduction of complementary State and Territory legislation that will support the regulatory framework set up under the Commonwealth's therapeutic goods legislation. Details of these changes are contained in the Second Reading speech for that bill, and the associated Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Principal Act that I am now introducing address the remaining administrative implications of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Act will be amended to enable the Commonwealth to collect annual charges for maintaining registrations and listings of therapeutic goods, and for maintaining manufacturing licences, where such registrations, listings and licences have been effected on behalf of the States and Territories under complementary therapeutic goods legislation. Charges to be collected by the Commonwealth for the performance of functions on behalf of the States or Territories will be commensurate with the level of charges currently collected for the same activities performed in relation to therapeutic goods that are regulated under the Commonwealth's jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are subject to the establishment of corresponding State and Territory laws that will adopt the Commonwealth's regulatory requirements. It is anticipated that the first State and Territory complementary legislation will be in place by as early as 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK (QUOTAS) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to extend the operation of the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 for a further three years until the end of 28 December 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 provides the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) with the powers to establish quota schemes on the export of meat and live sheep from Australia in particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of meat, the Act empowers the Corporation to operate quota schemes where restrictions are imposed, or likely to be imposed, on Australian exports by importing countries or by the Australian Government. Honourable Senators will be aware that the Corporation currently operates quota schemes for beef, mutton and goatmeat to the United States and for beef, sheepmeat and buffalo meat to the European Community in response to restrictions imposed by those markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quota on meat must be allocated free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In each of the last three years, Australia has reluctantly agreed to restrain exports of meat to the United States to avoid imposition of quotas under the US Meat Import Law (MIL).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The imposition of so-called Voluntary Restraint Agreements not only disrupts our trade to the United States, which is a major market for beef worth in excess of $1.1 billion, but also creates uncertainty and impacts on the stability of Australia's domestic and other export markets. The MIL continues to be a trade irritant between Australia and the United States, and the Australian Government is seeking to achieve the elimination of the MIL as part of a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the EC imposes quotas on the import of beef and sheepmeat. Although the access level of Australian meat into the EC is relatively small (17,500 tonnes of sheepmeat, 6,032 tonnes of beef and 2,250 tonnes of buffalo meat), the Community represents an important market for high valued product, worth almost $146 million in 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 also empowers the Corporation to operate quota systems on live sheep and lambs where the Corporation considers it in the best interests of the industry to do so. Quota on live sheep and lambs may be allocated free of charge or by auction, sale by tender or private sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporation has not used the powers conferred on it in relation to live sheep, but once the live sheep trade is resumed to Saudi Arabia, these powers will give the Corporation the option, if necessary, to control the supply of live sheep for export to the Saudi Arabian market as part of a mutually satisfactory arrangement under which the trade could operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia voluntarily suspended the live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia in 1991 following a series of rejections supposedly for quarantine reasons. The trade was suspended with the full support of the industry to prevent damage to the international standing of the Australian livesheep industry as a supplier of quality livestock in the Middle East and to ensure that the Government's animal welfare obligations were met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure all quota arrangements are equitable, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 requires the details of proposed quota allocation and management schemes to be set out in the AMLC's Corporate Plan, which must have Ministerial approval. These details must also be available to all exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in respect of AMLC decisions regarding the period of validity of quotas and variations to quotas granted. The AMLC is also required to publish details of all quotas allocated in its Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Passage of this bill will not effect Government expenditure and will have no staffing implications for the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion in order to draw attention to this year's anti-education budget. It is a punitive and brain draining budget which increases fees and loans for students and inflicts financial and psychological penalties on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are the lone voice for education and students in the Australian Parliament. Our record on education issues is second to none. We do not enjoy being in this splendid isolation, especially at a time in our nation's history when the community must be given incentives to develop its skills. The Democrats' commitment to an education system which is equitable and accessible by all, is unshakeable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was with some degree of interest and, indeed, scepticism that I read the comments of Mr Pyne, the Liberal member for Sturt, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. He urged the Democrats `to show some backbone and vote with the Liberals' in order to `block the changes to HECS'. The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 22 September stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party was likely to block the Budget amendments to the HECS in the Senate, the federal Liberal MP Chris Pyne said this week. Pyne said he was confident the party would decide to oppose changes to HECS, which would see graduates taking their second undergraduate degree charged double HECS. This followed discussions with his Liberal colleagues in both the Lower and Upper Houses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pyne said: "The ALP has unveiled an unexpected burden that will mainly hit young people trying to establish their careers.

<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The students who take the later option sign a one-sided agreement with a party that can change conditions at whim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pyne said while the Liberals did not hold the balance of power in the Senate, he believed the Democrats would be forced to vote with them on ideological grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>The article stated further:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The Democrats have always been very pro students but they have been very quiet about these changes, " . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That situation really has to be addressed. For the information of honourable senators and Mr Pyne, I believe the only way to deal with that accusation is to catalogue the so-called silence, starting with this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 10 August, which was before the budget&mdash;and a long time before 22 September when Mr Pyne was finally heard to raise his voice&mdash;I issued a press release entitled, `Budget horrors for students: Democrats leading role in national protest'. Essentially that press release stated our case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the University of Tasmania's Launceston campus I undertook, on behalf of the Democrats, to ensure that we voted against the proposed changes to HECS in the budget. This was part of a national day of action conducted in cooperation with the National Union of Students. I warned then what this budget signalled. I think that was the initial salvo in this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 12 August my colleague Senator Meg Lees from South Australia continued that warning by saying, `Welcome, Generation HECS. The budget heralds HECS hikes and funding cuts'. She described today's students as being `the debt generation'. She addressed students at the University of Adelaide. Mr Pyne was invited to that very function at which Senator Meg Lees spoke. He did not attend and did not make any announcement to either support or challenge Senator Lees at that time. I wonder where he was on that day. The new-found enthusiasm for these matters was not expressed by any Liberal Party member in any shape or form either then or until 22 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 August I launched a petition suggesting that students could send a message to government. This was well publicised and well distributed.

<PARA>On 19 August we saw the first of the flood of petitions which have come to light on this matter and which have been presented in this chamber almost every single sitting day since that budget day. Each of those petitions averages a couple of hundred signatures and I recall that one contained some 800 signatures. We have got to the stage where the aggregate is thousands of signatures. I dare say that flood of petitions will not readily dwindle, because I have seen another stack of them in my office just today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 August, still a long time before 22 September when we first heard from Mr Pyne, there was another press release from me which was well publicised. I recall speaking on radio across Australia on this matter. We announced our intention to continue to negotiate with regard to the education budget. The first sentence of that press release reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Australian Democrats will vote against HECS increases and the sinister erosion of student financial assistance', said Senator Robert Bell . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`We are committed to voting against these regressive measures in this punitive and brain-draining budget'.</PARA>
<PARA>On that same day I issued another press release, which was also well reported, again suggesting that the whole business was punitive. In particular, it drew attention to the measure which has been described lately by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, as well as by the National Union of Students, as being a move against the best principles of education theory, even. It is the proposition that those students who take longer than an extra semester to complete their degree should be penalised by being required to pay 50 per cent more HECS. On 28 August I listed that as one of the prime concerns which we would continue to campaign against and vote against when the bills finally reach this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 September I issued another press release asking the government to justify the budget increases to HECS repayments rates and levels and suggesting that students would be hit with a double whammy because they would have to pay double HECS rates for their second degrees. I criticised the government then for not sufficiently defining what a second degree was, or explaining how that program would be administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that day I asked a question without notice of the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training in this place, Senator Robert Ray. The essence of that question was to find out how many students would be affected. I referred to proposed budget changes and I asked the minister how many students would be affected by this double whammy when both increases applied. I also asked what the definition of a second degree was and how it would be administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray answered that approximately 11,000 students would have been liable to pay the double HECS in respect of a second undergraduate degree if it had applied in 1992. It was estimated that if the 50 per cent increase in HECS payable by students who took longer to complete their degrees had been applied in 1991, 12,000 students would have been liable in that way. I think that was significant. I pursued that matter and found out the details. This was 1 September and we still had not heard a squeak from Mr Pyne, who had yet to discover the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 September the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> reported that the university leaders, as they were described in this particular article, which was the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, had criticised as unfair and illogical the measures which I have just been describing. They at least acknowledged that the Australian Democrats were involved in opposing this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently, on 27 September, there were another 125 people on the list of petitions that I previously mentioned. Also on that day I am sure honourable senators will recall my question to Senator Robert Ray representing the minister about the disproportionate effect which the penalty for slow progress will have on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I also asked about the increases in HECS charges and how that would disproportionately affect women, who are five times less likely than men to have repaid their HECS loan before the age of 30. I asked those questions as part of an overall strategy to reveal the government's general lack of understanding of how this will penalise students, and perhaps even the lack of a factual basis upon which these proposals have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I followed that up with a press release on 28 September headed, `Democrats reveal government ignorance'. I was not impressed by the fact that the government was not aware of the studies which had been done at Sydney University with regard to this and the fact that 82 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are likely to be affected by the silly proposition that if one takes more than one semester longer than the minimum time to complete a degree, one will be slugged with 50 per cent extra HECS. I think I have amply demonstrated the ignorance of the government in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to this day. So much for the contention that the Democrats have been silent on this. I know that my colleague Senator Woodley has been vociferous in his opposition in Queensland and that Senator Lees, in South Australia, has been equally determined to reveal how inequitable these proposals are.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Pyne is right to discuss the matter with his Liberal colleagues. He says he has done it in both upper and lower houses.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This record reveals that the whole episode we are talking about now is nothing more than a blatant publicity stunt on behalf of this new Liberal MP. He is attempting to attract the youth and student vote that the coalition sadly and desperately lacks. The students have been betrayed by these budget proposals of the government. The students must repay their HECS debt faster and sooner, and they face further financial penalties if they fail to complete courses within a minimum time. They are being rushed through the system as fast as possible in much the same way as products off a conveyor belt. The penalty for not rushing through as fast as possible is to increase the HECS repayments by 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases in the rates of HECS repayment&mdash;from the previous rates of two per cent, three per cent and four per cent, to three per cent, four per cent and five per cent&mdash;and the parallel lowering of the threshold at which students begin to repay their HECS debt from $27,748 to $26,402 are nothing but sinister moneymaking measures at a time when graduate starting salaries are at a 16-year low. This means that more people will be hit by that threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students will have to consider carefully whether it is worth being slugged with a double HECS debt. Students who fail to complete their courses within a minimum time face a 50 per cent increase in their HECS repayments for each additional unit that they undertake. This budget views education as a mere moneymaking commodity. It has no concern about the impact of these financial and psychological disincentives on traditionally disadvantaged groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned, women are five times less likely than men to repay their HECS debts by the age of 30. Yet this government has introduced a measure which discriminates against women, especially mature age women who may have interrupted periods of study due to domestic or employment commitments. Women are measurably discriminated against by this proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Mr Pyne's initiative brings about a situation where the opposition starts to think about this, perhaps even hears the cries of students and actually does something. I will paraphrase Mr Pyne, who said something about somebody having to put their money where their mouth is and suggested that the opposition should be doing that. What a mouth it is. It opens only in mock protest against budget measures. Students will be saddled with a debt for life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it really counts, I predict that the government and the coalition will prove once again how bipartisan education policy is. The coalition would do well to listen to those who have convinced Mr Pyne that it is important to bring up this issue. As to his suggestions about the way to resolve this, I think it would be wise to look at the track record. Those who have most consistently opposed it, the Democrats, have been repeatedly confirmed as the only political party committed to a fair and accessible education system for all Australians. We are giving the Liberals and the government a chance to prove otherwise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the chamber for long, but I was given the honour of representing Mr Beazley in this chamber after the last election, so I should at least put a government view. The late Billy Hughes once said the following: `See a move, block it; see a sore, rub it'. Senator Bell has followed his advice today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the greatest `I told you so' motions that I have seen moved in this chamber. It is disappointing in one sense. While it might be a bit of theatre to poke fun at the Liberal Party over its dilemma of a maverick member going off in one direction without the benefit of counselling from his leadership, on the other hand the Democrats get only two opportunities in the spring session to move a general business matter. I think the sort of psychic salary that Senator Bell has achieved out of this issue today is not in proportion to the value he could have achieved on other issues, although I do concede that he has used this issue in a somewhat disguised way to reopen the HECS debate generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue came up primarily as a result of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Fiona Carruthers reporting the views of a Mr Pyne, the member for Sturt in South Australia. Mr Pyne had a burst of opportunistic excess in discussing these issues somewhere and, not knowing the history of HECS and where the Democrats stood on it, he decided to put the blowtorch to the Democrats. The fact is that he has misunderstood where the Democrats have stood on HECS from start to finish: they have opposed it. They have been consistent, and they have been wrong from start to finish. The same tired old arguments are being trotted out here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If HECS had to be repaid yearly irrespective of income, there would be a lot of merit to what Senator Bell has said. He always says that academic salaries and things are not going up as fast as expected. But, if they do not reach the cut-in point, they do not pay it. Whilst we have a responsibility for people doing second degrees and people who unfortunately fail and have to repeat part of their course, we have an equal responsibility for those in the community who are currently deprived of getting a tertiary education. This government's emphasis&mdash;I think the opposition is coming from a different path&mdash;has been to try to open up as many positions as possible for people to attend tertiary institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for those who have a money tree in their backyards like the Democrats, this does not present a problem&mdash;print more money, allocate more money but never give the government the means of raising the revenue, by cutting budgets to ribbons. That is not a practical approach but it is one that a minority party can sustain because it never has to balance its wish list with the real demands of governments and the allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found Mr Pyne's statement interesting because Senator Bell has probably properly identified what is developing in the Liberal Party&mdash;a total policy hiatus.

Those opposite made a mistake to become embittered and they made a mistake initially to blame the electorate for their loss. When they looked at themselves, they made another basic decision. How could they have lost five elections in a row? If they had gone to the electorate with a positive platform, how dare the people not support them?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This naturally put pressure on the leadership of the Liberal Party and Dr John Hewson, in particular. Their answer was to dump all policy. I do not think Dr Hewson had any other strategic choice but to dump all policy. If he had indicated that he was going to hang on to it, his colleagues, especially some of the less altruistic ones sitting both in this chamber and in the other one, would have seen him removed fairly rapidly. Therefore, we are going to have a policy hiatus out of the Liberals for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not to be recommended that a defeated opposition  should try to produce an alternative policy a few weeks or even a few months after an election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing in the macro sense that those in the Liberal Party recommend expenditure cuts but the first time action is taken, as I have had to do, to close a small military base or something else, they are all in there objecting saying, `You can't do that'. The micro approach triumphs time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In retrospect, we made a rather foolish promise that, if we lost government and had to go onto the opposition benches, in spite of our rigorous opposition to the alternative fiscal and tax regime that the coalition would impose, we would not block those measures in the Senate. We have been paid back in kind by the opposition trying to block everything that moves, leaving a potential extra deficit this year of $500 million and $1.7 billion in the second out year. That is predicated, of course, on the first proposition of wholesale sales tax increases going through. You can add enormously to that into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Senator Bell has indicated a certain narrow level of hypocrisy in Liberal Party education policy. He could have gone on to say that this simply reflects the whole of the coalition at the moment where we see no policy, no rationality, and fiscal and revenue vandalism at its worst. The theory of those opposite is, `Let's deprive the government of as much revenue as possible. Let's force them into unpopular expenditure cuts'.

I said to him, `Yes, you used to love it. You used to love people who didn't understand opinion polls. You used to love people who couldn't run an advertising campaign.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in summary that the government will not be voting for this particular motion because it is not factually correct when it `welcomes this expression of new-found support by the Liberal Party for Australia's tertiary students'.

I think those opposite have said&mdash;I know Senator Teague will correct me&mdash;that the jury is out, and that they will consider it on its merits. Neither I nor those on my side can vote for a motion that is not strictly in accordance, not so much with the truth but with the reality as we see it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had two predictable speeches on education&mdash;one from the government from Senator Ray and one from the Democrats' Senator Bell. The debate has grown into some wide-ranging evaluation of the last election and why we all sit in the seats that we sit in now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to say with regard to Senator Bell's motion that it is consistent with the Democrats' position over many years now that, irrespective of the cost to taxpayers, the Democrats would give free education to tertiary students. The Democrats will never be in a position to do it, but they will persist with this consistent line in order to try to woo tertiary students to vote, not at six per cent for the Democrats but perhaps six and a half per cent for the Democrats. They would be led along by the nose that somehow or other the Democrats would be able to give free education to tertiary students&mdash;Austudy for all, no HECS, and all you have to do is pass year 12 and the Democrats would put you straight into university and give you an allowance to pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the position of the Democrats. Therefore, they say to everyone else in the chamber who is responsible and who does have to answer to the taxpayer that we should try to win the affections of tertiary students in the way that they so irresponsibly have urged in that policy approach with regard to HECS, Austudy and tertiary students generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to my good friend Senator Bell that his speech today was predictable. It was consistent with the Democrats' irresponsible taxation policy for all Australians. It would cost billions of dollars more for the Australian taxpayers who are suffering in a recession, a rural recession, with a million unemployed. But the Democrats would add another $5 billion of tax to provide the irresponsible, open slather policies that we see reflected in Senator Bell's speech today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this chamber will not be lured from what we regard as a responsible policy that has to add up for all Australians. I find greatly encouraging when visiting universities, as I do frequently, that a majority of students do not vote Democrat because responsibly they put their minds to what is affordable within Australia, to what is a fair thing with regard to their own personal contribution to their study, to what is a fair thing with regard to allowances under Austudy and how far that can be spread around Australia. Of course, if one superficially approaches any group and does not give them a chance to think responsibly, they will put their hands up for a benefit that may come particularly to them. If one looks only superficially at tertiary students, one could well come up with a policy to give Austudy to all, to abolish HECS for all and to have completely free education on the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Bell spoke with regard to my colleague the honourable member for Sturt, Mr Pyne, he did not project those Democrat policies on to my colleague, a Liberal member of the House of Representatives, but rather he commended him for listening carefully and being in dialogue with students. When I began my speech in the chamber I was surrounded by the two youngest members on the coalition benches. I refer to Senator Bill O'Chee, who I think is about 26, and my colleague Senator Ian Campbell, who I think is about 34. Senator O'Chee came here to this chamber in his twenties and Senator Campbell came here perhaps just after turning 30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that both Senator O'Chee and Senator Campbell join with me in wishing to continue the dialogue with young Australians. I speak as another erstwhile young member of this chamber, having been here for 15-odd years. I think I came here when I was 33 and came to this place from the University of Adelaide where I was employed. We must have the sort of spirit so admirably displayed by Chris Pyne in being in dialogue with young Australians to ensure that, as politicians, we listen to young Australians. Certainly the Liberal and National parties want to hear the views of all tertiary students and all young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague from South Australia, Chris Pyne, was elected for the first time in March this year to a seat that I know very well; I lived and worked in that area for many years. I commend the refreshing approach that he and all of us in the Liberal Party bring to the job of listening to students. Mr Pyne, who I think is now 26 and who was 25 when he was elected to parliament, happens to be the only member of parliament who has ever paid HECS, the higher education contribution scheme. It may well be that one or two others have paid it, but they have not disclosed that to me. Certainly Mr Pyne has paid HECS with regard to his last couple of years of enrolment in university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Pyne is the youngest member of the parliament and as a new Liberal member in the House of Representatives he has gone out of his way to make sure that he listens to all parts of his electorate, including tertiary students. He has a very important campus, the University of South Australia, very close to his electorate office and I am sure that there and in every other part of the electorate he has listened to people. I acknowledge that Senator Bell in no way imputed to Mr Pyne Democrat policy or any criticism for the carefulness with which he represents the tertiary students of his electorate and for having been in dialogue with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is normal and natural that his individual views as the views of the youngest member in the coalition will be expressed to us when we meet in the party room. With regard to the higher education funding legislation, including the higher education contribution scheme, the Liberal and National parties have not yet determined their policy approach to the legislation&mdash;as to what precise form the amendments will take to improve the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dialogue that is now under way that is preceding that determination it is to be expected that a member such as my colleague Mr Pyne will express his own personal view. Indeed, his own personal view was quoted in the newspaper. He even rightly said, as quoted in the newspaper, that this matter has not been determined by his colleagues in the Liberal and National parties but that he was talking to them. He also did not purport to be the education spokesman for the Liberal and National parties. It is reasonable for an active and alert member of the House of Representatives to think through these matters and then to bring his conclusions to the discussion in the party room and this parliament, but certainly that can be done in some detail with regard to HECS. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to see that the government does not go beyond reasonable limits when it puts a new penalty on those who undertake second degrees. After 15 years of debate in this chamber on education matters, it is my view that it would be wrong if the government, even unintentionally, were to put an unfair burden on those Australians who undertook second degrees for which there was a legitimate, combined and good effect in the way in which those people with a double degree would in their chosen professions be able to serve all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in Senator Bolkus's and Senator Cooney's field of law, it is quite normal these days for law undergraduates to take on a combined degree with arts or economics. For example, one of my good friends in South Australia young Rob Bailey&mdash;a very able South Australian&mdash;is doing an engineering-law degree. He has rightly perceived that the vocabulary of engineering and law can be put together to give a specialist approach that is very useful for both professions and for the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have these kinds of combined degrees: often a degree in medicine will be combined with a degree in physiology; often a degree in mathematics will be combined with a degree in science&mdash;and so it goes on. There are some usual double degrees and I would urge the government&mdash;even now I take the chance&mdash;that there be no prohibition, no further penalty, added to Australians undertaking such combined degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would further say that there ought not to be a double rate of HECS, even where the first degree was undertaken and completed and some years have elapsed before the second degree is begun. When that second degree is begun I believe that, if it is a part of a usual combined degree, it ought to attract a student contribution at the single rate of HECS, not at the double rate of HECS. In that way, where people take on a second degree as a second profession, as a complete new start, they do not gain from the taxpayer a benefit by doing it at the single rate of HECS; rather, they would incur the double rate of HECS, if this government, being the elected government, is determined to make such a proposition. So I would want to urge, as I understand my colleague Mr Pyne would, that there not be this penalty on usual combined degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area is the government's proposal that HECS accumulate at 1 1/2 times the normal rate where a student has not made normal progress through a course. The government is proposing that if it takes six months more than normal, any additional study accumulate HECS at the 1 1/2 times rate. I would urge the government that it be at least a full year behind before that so-called penalty rate of 1 1/2 times is attracted. That is a matter for discussion; it is a personal view of mine which I put now in the chamber, as I have the opportunity. As a third matter in relation to HECS, I believe that it ought not to be retrospective in any significant or substantial way. </PARA>

I think that that principle of non-retrospectivity ought to be one that we take into account in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to be as substantial and fair dinkum as I can be. I see Senator Woodley and Senator Bell nodding. I also put these personal views. We are all senators in dialogue with students. We want to see good outcomes for education in Australia&mdash;certainly we in the Liberal and National parties do. Let me put a personal view in the same way as Mr Pyne has put a personal view&mdash;and it is still to be determined in the party and parliamentary debate as to what the precise situation will be at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise another matter which I know the National Union of Students has already discussed with the minister, Mr Beazley. It has not been at all happy about that discussion; it has not been welcoming of the responses that the minister gave. Mr Acting Deputy President, as a medical practitioner you would well know that a medical student usually takes on four subjects in first year, and we will say that each subject is a quarter of the year's workload. If a medical student fails one of those subjects&mdash;passing three but failing one&mdash;most medical schools will not allow that student to go into second year until he or she picks up the quarter of the year missed out on. In that event, it would appear that they are going to take 12 months to catch up. Mr Beazley infers from this that that student would be one year behind as a result of failing one quarter of a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it&mdash;and the National Union of Students and students generally put it&mdash;that the student's rate of progress should be docked only a quarter of a year and not a full year. The student is doing a part-time second year, presumably with access to some part-time work if the student can find it. Therefore, I believe that this is a directly practical matter that ought to be acknowledged by the government and, in particular, by my good friend the minister, Mr Beazley: do not dock the students a year when they are only behind by a quarter of a year; let them catch that up and do not use this legislation to count it against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the matters which spring to our discussion when we are trying to have dialogue with the students of Australia and the government has made announcements for HECS reform in this way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really do ask Senator Bolkus, when he goes to the cabinet table, to take just those four suggestions, to make sure that the cabinet ensures that the legislation does not offend in these ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would go on only to say further that, when the budget was put down, with its announcements about HECS, two days later the leader of the coalition, Dr Hewson, gave a very clear response to the budget in which he said that there were four particularly offensive elements of the budget that Mr Dawkins had announced and that the Liberal and National parties would resolutely oppose them. There were other matters which we regarded as objectionable but which we would leave until we had referred them for Senate committee inquiry and other matters which we would leave until we saw the precise legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the Senate that it was these four most offensive matters to which we announced our immediate opposition: the increase in the petrol tax, the increase in the wine tax, the increase in sales tax and the retrospective increase in tax on accumulated leave&mdash;it was both an increase and retrospective. We hope still to win support in this chamber for our position on all four measures. We have already had an effect upon one or two other matters. We have objected to the fringe benefits tax effect on the accommodation industry in this country&mdash;and the government is backtracking like mad on that matter. We objected to the new increased tax that has been put on credit unions by the Labor government. There was also the measure with regard to optometrical benefits under Medicare&mdash;which the government has completely backed down on, given the statements that we and the community at large have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will give careful consideration to legislation that is outside the four most offensive elements of this budget and, when we come to the debate, we will of course announce what our position is. Why is it that we have opposed these four particular matters with such severity, with such total opposition right from the start? It is because the government lied to the electorate with regard to these matters, fooling the Australian public to vote for the Labor Party in the last election&mdash;and then it comes in with this reprehensible budget announcing such lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with all of my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties in making sure that this government will always understand that it must come to budgets with the program and with the policies it took to the election. It cannot get away with winning an election on one set of grounds and then trying to put into place, through budgets and other legislation, a program on other grounds. Where there are lies, we will oppose them; where there are broken promises, we will oppose them. That is why I, with all my colleagues, still hope that we can gain a majority&mdash;and one is forming and looks to be solid&mdash;with regard to the reprehensible increase in petrol tax, wine tax, sales tax and the tax on accumulated leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to my friend and Senate colleague Senator Ray when he took this as a good opportunity to talk about what he saw as a&mdash;did honourable senators hear the word?&mdash;vacuum. He is trying to be derogatory of the Liberal and National parties' policy position. There is no vacuum in the Liberal and National parties.

<PARA>Here we are, and how many more words have we contributed to this parliament since the first speeches of those two notable Australian women? I thought I would take the opportunity in speaking to this motion to refer to an excellent paper prepared for submission by the Australian National Group to the Parity Working Group of the Interparliamentary Union, which met here recently, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a plan of action to correct present imbalances in the participation of men and women in political life</EMPHASIS>. This was published in August this year. I think it helps to set the scene in Australia in 1993 to look at this matter from an historical perspective. Women won the right to vote relatively early in this country but prevailing social values meant that the first women were not elected to the federal parliament until 1943. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Political scientist Dr Marian Sawer has pointed out that although Australia was a pioneer of women's suffrage, it had the greatest time lag of any country in the world between the eligibility of women to stand for the national legislature and their actual arrival in it. While women currently comprise only 8.8 per cent of parliamentarians in the House of Representatives, their higher representation in the Senate, where we are 17 out of 76, lifts this overall figure to 13 per cent for the Australian federal parliament. If we take state and federal parliaments together, the representation of women has risen over the years and is now a whopping 14.5 per cent, compared with zero in 1921 and 10.1 per cent in 1987!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With 14.5 per cent of the total seats in Australian parliaments, women in Australia have a higher degree of representation than do women in many other countries. But if one compares us with our Scandinavian friends one will see that our present record is overshadowed because in countries such as Norway and Finland 40 per cent of their members are female. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of reasons are put forward as to why we ought to have more women in parliament and why we do not have enough women in parliament. There are five basic arguments that are usually put forward in support of the need for women's increased representation, not just in politics but also in positions of political leadership. The first argument is based on democracy and egalitarianism&mdash;the fact that women constitute half the population and they should be represented proportionately and the recognition that women's rights to full citizenship must be reflected in their effective participation in the various levels of political life. People rightly say that there cannot be true democracy where women are excluded from positions of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second argument that is often put forward for why we need increased participation of women relates to legitimacy. The argument is that women's underrepresentation can be dangerous for democratic systems where the validity of all-male decision making is under question. There is an increasing awareness that the outcome of such decision making is not the same for men and for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third argument which is usually put forward is that of difference of interests. Men and women have different interests. Political participation involves articulating, providing and defending these different points of view or these different interests. I think it is a very reasonable proposition to say that women know better about their own needs and interests in the same way as men are probably more aware of their own. For example, women have been better aware of the need for access to things such as family planning. They have been very aware of what they require as the bottom line in the provision of things such as child care. Studies have shown that where there are a lot of women parliamentarians in a parliament, such as in Finland, they have initiated legislation which benefits women and other disadvantaged groups more frequently than have men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth argument is that the increased representation of women actually broadens the political agenda because women bring to the parliament issues such as child care. We are enlarging the public sphere of life just in being able to bring these issues into the chambers. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they do. Dr Marian Sawer, whom I cited earlier, has shown how the increase in women representatives from two per cent to 13 per cent in parliament over the last two decades has resulted in a redefinition of politics in this country with the inclusion of issues such as abortion, domestic violence, sexual harassment, rape, single parenthood, women's health and suburban isolation as normal parts of public debate in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth argument is really obvious&mdash;the efficient use of human resources. If women, as they do, comprise half of the world's pool of potential talent and ability, why not use it?  Why not use it efficiently for the benefit of this nation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes people add another argument along the lines that the increased participation of women can actually lead to a reform or an improvement of politics. Very frequently research records an increasing level of cynicism, particularly about the confrontationist tactics and style characterised by male politicians in this country. Opinion poll research has suggested that women politicians are viewed differently. For example, a 1991 ANOP survey of a Queensland electorate showed that 64 per cent of those surveyed believed men enter politics out of personal ambition and desire for money and that only 11 per cent believed that women have the same motive. Thirteen per cent of those surveyed believed that men were motivated by altruism and concern for community welfare and 54 per cent believed this of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of reasons are advanced for why we have this gender imbalance. It is really pleasing to see that we, in all the political parties, are looking much more seriously at this issue. I could point to the record of the Australian Democrats. We have had three female leaders and, throughout our history, we have had roughly a fifty-fifty level of representation of men and women in our parliamentary party. I think, though, it is very important that we, as a society, recognise that we need to address and redress the gender imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently read a very interesting article in a newspaper which pointed to the role that the proportional representation voting system has played in Scandinavia, where there are more female parliamentarians. The article noted that, where there was a contest for a single member electorate, men fought really hard and the numbers were organised more successfully for the men because they thought this was the do or die effort; this was the only prize. But wherever there was a list for people to choose from, very often in the preselection process and in the compilation of that list, people looked for a gender balance or they said, `Yes, it's okay for a woman to be on this list'. Then the voters very often looked for the female candidate to vote for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the representation in the House of Representatives, which reflects single member electorates, and the representation in the Senate, which reflects the proportional representation voting system, one sees that a very real and tangible link can be made. The voting system&mdash;in this case it is proportional representation&mdash;has been responsible for the election of more women, not just in Australia, but throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Explanations for the underrepresentation of women have included political socialisation, a lack of interest, an unwillingness of women to put themselves forward as candidates and, in some countries, lesser educational opportunities. Very often women cite the confrontationist style in the atmosphere of male dominated parliaments and the unsympathetic treatment of women by the media as real disincentives. They do not want to be involved in something which they see essentially as either dirty or confrontationist. But we all know that it does not have to be like that. We would not stay here if it were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another relevant point relates to the massive size of this continent. We travel to this place for about 26 weeks of the year. That is a very difficult thing for many women who have chosen to have families. I am sure it is also difficult for fathers to leave their children for 26 weeks of the year. Nevertheless, I think that, while women choose&mdash;and are often forced&mdash;to be the major nurturers, it is very hard for them to free themselves from that role to also live out the necessities of that equally demanding role of being a full time member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the history of women parliamentarians in Australia, we see that it is very interesting and quite inspiring. I would like to repeat some of the comments I made at the launch of Ann Millar's marvellous book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS>. I referred to women who have had an important place in the political history of this country, starting with Enid Lyons and Dorothy Tangney; Annabelle Rankin, who was the first woman to hold the office of whip&mdash;one of the delightful photographs in this book is that of Senator Margaret Reid and Senator Susan Knowles, each holding up a whip on their election as whip and deputy whip of the opposition&mdash;Margaret Guilfoyle, who was the first woman to have portfolio responsibilities for a government department; Susan Ryan, who was the first Labor woman to sit in cabinet; Joan Child, who was the first woman Speaker of the House of Representatives; Janine Haines, who was the first Australian Democrat in federal parliament and the first woman to lead an Australian political party; Carolyn Jakobsen, who was the first woman chair of caucus; and Kathy Sullivan, who has served in both houses of parliament and has been a parliamentarian for 20 of the 50 years that this book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS>, covers. </PARA>

We can look at the issues we are talking about today. We can assess the roles we play and the contributions we are able to make as members of this chamber. We can be reflective of what those who have gone before us have had to work towards so that we could be in this position today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to rise in this place to support this motion moved by Senator Kernot, which marks the 50th anniversary of the first speech in the Australian Senate by a woman, Dame Dorothy Tangney and the 50th anniversary of the first speech in the Australian House of Representatives by a woman, Dame Enid Lyons. The motion also notes that we have had only 59 women elected since then and it congratulates Ms Ann Millar on her book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to rise in support of this motion. One of the things that I liked very much about the book was to find the maiden speeches of Dorothy Tangney and Enid Lyons in the back of it. For those who have time to search the library or who have not misplaced their previous copies, it is very good to find those speeches in the back of the book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly struck by the similarities and the points of difference in the comments of Dorothy Tangney and Enid Lyons all those years ago. Two points made by Dorothy Tangney stand in my mind. First, we must remember that her speeches were made in 1943 when Australia was still well engaged in the Second World War. In her remarks Dorothy Tangney said that she hoped Australia would recognise the importance of having a new view of itself and its place in the world&mdash;that is, its place in the Pacific&mdash;and the importance of working with the countries that are near neighbours. That was an acute observation by Dorothy Tangney all those years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further on in her speech Dorothy Tangney referred to the fact that the Australian people were finding #1.5 million for the war effort. She sincerely hoped that they would find #1.5 million for the peace effort, particularly when the war ended to assist people to get established in Australia with the change in industry and all the other things that went with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also particularly enjoyed reading Enid Lyons's comments  about new brooms sweeping things clean, while not wanting to refer to the House of Representatives as a cupboard. I am not sure whether such metaphors should be commented upon. I thought it was rather well set; I enjoyed the way she set it out. There is probably some awful apposition about the use of a broom to sweep clean the House of Representatives. I also liked her reference to heat in kitchens. As I remember it, that phrase belongs to some American politician. I think the place of women has always been in politics, if only in metaphor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly this book by Ann Millar highlights, as Senator Kernot said, the significant dearth of women in this place&mdash;dearth as to their number rather than their contribution. There are 59 women on the cover of the book and I like that line very much. It is Senator Kernot's line, but I will use it again, if I may. </PARA>

I hope that the next time we publish an updated version of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS> the number of women will be far more than one cover's worth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A month or so ago I was able to join state ministers at a meeting of Commonwealth-state ministers on the status of women, which was held in Wellington, New Zealand, to acknowledge the suffrage celebrations of the women's vote in New Zealand. I join in congratulating New Zealand on that achievement a hundred years ago. I had the pleasure of doing that more formally in the New Zealand High Commission just the other night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the woman acknowledged for leading the campaign in New Zealand is Kate Shepphard. The day after the election she presented a white carnation to the parliamentarians who voted yes for women's suffrage. When we were in Wellington, Minister Jenny Shipley was fascinated to comment on the foresight and planning of women. Two years before this centenary celebration, some women, recognising the opportunity, bred a new camellia which they named the Kate Shepphard camellia. It is now planted the length and breadth of New Zealand. It is turning out to be a very successful program. The camellia is worth it in its own right and it is a very striking highlight of this year's celebration. Again, I acknowledge the wit, wisdom and inventiveness of women's minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I would love to share with this parliament is an account of one of the many celebrations in New Zealand this year. On this occasion women walked, jogged, rode, hiked, backpacked, mountain climbed and rock climbed to the top of seven mountains. From the top of those seven mountains they were able to speak to each other by a Telecom hook-up. The whole episode was filmed from a helicopter. The people of New Zealand were able to see these women covering the slopes and getting to the tops of mountains. As much as it demonstrates the physical prowess and capabilities of women, it is nice to think how high women can go&mdash;even to the tops of mountains, given half a chance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Loosley. It is a matter of great celebration. While we mark this year as a centenary of the women's vote in New Zealand, next year in South Australia we will mark a particularly significant first. Not only did the South Australian women get the right to vote, but they also got the right to stand for parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, this was not the intention of the people moving the motion at the time. An amendment was moved as a tactic to try to defeat the bill for yet a third time on the grounds that it might get women the vote but certainly would not enable them to stand for parliament. But the people moving the amendment did not get the numbers right. So as a result of a grudging contribution, in 1894 women in South Australia not only had the right to vote but also the right to stand for parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very importantly, that voting right also covered Aboriginal women. There are some histories and records of Aboriginal women who were able to exercise their right to vote in South Australia. The history is still a bit cloudy as to whether Aboriginal women did have the right to vote in the 1902 bill. It is certain that very few were able to exercise it because they were not encouraged to vote or advised on the matter, or indeed even knew how to get on the electoral roll. We do know that post 1967, Aboriginal women and men were finally acknowledged as citizens in their own right in their own country. Since then, of course, Aboriginal women have been able to exercise their right to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some countries I have visited&mdash;for example, Mozambique&mdash;Australia's expertise in assisting people to get on to the electoral roll and to learn of their right to vote in a democracy has been one of the stunning successes enjoyed by this country and a service that we have been asked to provide to other countries. We are very pleased to assist. The people in Mozambique, who are preparing for their first democratic elections, have been assisted by our Electoral Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it certainly has. Those countries have been interested to know about the Australian Electoral Commission's capacity to be able to go to remote places and to talk with people. For example, it has talked to Aboriginal people, whose first language is not English. Indeed, it has been at pains to reach people in Australia, particularly those in rural, remote and Aboriginal communities. It has served as a model that is now much sought after by countries such as Mozambique. It is one of the things that makes me very proud of this country. It is vitally important that the democratic right to vote is experienced by women in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record and the edification of some senators, I simply conclude my comments about South Australia by saying that, as late as 1959 in South Australia, a woman who was elected to parliament&mdash;Jessie Cooper&mdash;had her right to sit in parliament challenged in the Supreme Court by the Liberal man who was defeated in preselection. The case he brought against the Electoral Commission was to the effect that Jessie Cooper was a woman and not `a person' under the act. That occurred in 1959 in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be pleased to know that the president of the time, Mr Playford, made it quite clear, by amending legislation, that women were persons, which is what the Supreme Court found. It is a case that is not without quite a lot of precedent in England. Indeed, the reason it was able to be argued that women were not `persons' flowed from a widely held view that women were not fit for public office. This was spelt out in all sorts of ways in court cases in England in the 19th century. Unfortunately, in some cases it has been repeated in courts in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best examples I know is the campaign against women getting into universities in the late 19th century. Senior Victorian politicians and public figures argued strenuously in the late 19th century that if women went to universities their uteruses would shrivel! There ought to be a loud hoot of laughter. It is quite clear that gender transliteration of that kind of comment would never be said because women are not so silly&mdash;neither are most men these days. That is just one example of the absolute stupidity that women had to campaign against. It was not just a battle for their rights, but they also had to deal with a campaign of folly, of put down and of destruction&mdash;a clear denial of rights for women. Our grandmothers had to muster all the possible arguments to counter nonsense of that sort&mdash;at a time when they did not have access to property, to a university education or to the vote, in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of their fight in Australia is something about which we should be remarkably proud. Until this book was written, we knew very little about this history. I congratulate Ann Millar for writing this book. She has actually given us a volume that we can present to our sons and daughters, to our schools and to our communities so that that history is not forgotten, not written out of existence and not overlooked, but powerfully taught. It ought not be just a matter of women's rights, although that seems to me to be sufficient justification&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Loosley, it is a matter of human rights. It is also a matter of a great achievement for democracy. Australia, with New Zealand, was teaching the rest of the world&mdash;as the title of the book and that wonderful banner suggest&mdash;that people can trust the women, however one wants to interpret that. I do not know how <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> can show the difference between `trust the women' and `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">trust</EMPHASIS> the women'. It looks the same on paper, but there are two meanings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly interesting to note that in 1911 that banner painted by Dora Meeson was being paraded in England in, I think, the coronation suffrage parade. It was only two years after that, in 1913, that the cat and mouse acts were introduced into English law to deal with those outrageous creatures&mdash;women&mdash;who were being taken to gaol, going on starvation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cat and mouse acts were introduced to enable the force feeding of those women who then recovered enough to come out of gaol, to demonstrate again, to be arrested, to go into gaol, to go on hunger strike, to be force fed and around they went again. Here were the women of England in 1913 being submitted to that kind of legislation. I wonder what we would be saying in this place if the government or another party tried to introduce that kind of legislation. Here was England going to such lengths to stop women achieving the rights that Australian and New Zealand women had achieved some 20 years earlier. I actually think it is a remarkable achievement for the antipodean countries of New Zealand and Australia. I am pleased to speak about this at every opportunity I get and I am, indeed, very proud of those achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The book has many photographs and I am delighted that Senator Kernot referred to one. Contemporary photos being what they are, I say, `That is nice, there are my friends'. But the photo I particularly like is the one of Vida Goldstein looking absolutely splendid going off to be a candidate in the election in 1903. I am not sure that I could ever look like Vida Goldstein, but I refer anybody reading the book to that photo&mdash;there is a model for us all. What a feisty and spunky lady she was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we have this history for our sons and daughters to read. It is also an acknowledgment of the contribution women have made to building this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate what has been said here and in other places: quite clearly we do not have sufficient numbers of women in parliament&mdash;either in our federal parliament or in our state parliaments. Quite clearly we do not have enough women on the boards of management in this country, in senior management positions, as senior members of our universities or in senior positions in our public sector. One could not be satisfied with the representation of women in any of those positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we campaign to get fair and reasonable representation of women&mdash;at least 50 per cent as a goal&mdash;in all of those positions. It is not a question of just going for a quota; it is striving for fair recognition of the variety of talents and contributions that women can make. As I have said in other places, it is a profligate country that is prepared to waste the talent of 51 per cent of its people. It is a matter of justice, it is a matter of equity and it is also a matter of best practice. If one deliberately overlooked talent in trying to fill positions in management, then I think it would be a measure of inadequate management or poor hiring practices. We do not have enough women in those positions and we suffer because we do not utilise their talents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting this motion and congratulating Ann Millar on her book, I certainly believe that we have a wonderful marker in the continuing struggle for a fair representation of women here and in other forums. There is absolutely no doubt at all that the contribution made by women over the years in this place is no less and indeed very often much more than the contribution of other senators. Women can certainly make their contribution in this place&mdash;they have done so and they will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a matter of equity and opportunity for this country that we ensure that the balance changes. That is something which is of great concern to the Labor Party and is being rigorously debated in all quarters of the party. I am very pleased to know that that debate is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of whether there will be more women, but how more women will be preselected. I would like to think that the expectation now is that women do not have to fight to justify their capacity. What we have to do now is merely fight for the opportunity to have a go and to take a place in society. That is one of the great cries of this country. It is certainly time to make sure women have a piece of that action. </PARA>

The motion notes that 24 September 1993 marks the 50th anniversary of the first speech in the Australian Senate by a woman, and that 29 September marks the 50th anniversary of the first speech in the Australian House of Representatives by a woman.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable senators have just noticed that Ann Millar is hiding up there in the press gallery. I suppose she thinks she is a press person now that she has published something. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS> was launched this week and commemorates the anniversary of the advent of women in the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to join the Leader of the Democrats and my colleagues, who have spoken and will speak, in commending Ann Millar for her book. Some of my other colleagues, who will not be speaking, have commended Ann Millar personally. I congratulate her not only for writing the book which provides an informative written and pictorial record of women in federal parliament, but also for organising a wonderful exhibition in the public area of the House. Usually such exhibitions come and go very quickly, but this one has stood the test of time. When one looks at that exhibition one sees the extent Ann had to go to collect the material, quotations and photographs of people like Rose Scott, Vida Goldstein and Catherine Helen Spence. It would have been great to have actually had the opportunity to meet some of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Crowley was talking about the feisty nature of some of those people, it reminded me very much of my grandmother's aunt who reared my grandmother. When I was a small child I knew that she lived at about the same time as Rose Scott, Vida Goldstein and Catherine Helen Spence. She chose not to marry and wanted to have a licence of a hotel. In order to do that she had to be married. So she got married and had the marriage annulled three days after she got the licence for the hotel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from a long line of feisty women. I love the quote that is attributed to Rose Scott in the exhibition. She was asked why she did not get married and she said, `Life is too short to spend it in the service of one man'. I think that is a very good quotation. I take heart from the quote that Ann Millar found. I am sure Rose was not saying it in a negative way, but she had so much to do that she was going to get on with her life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those characters come out very clearly in the exhibition. They were the people who set the pace, who probably did not achieve everything they wanted to achieve in terms of being in the political life and being members of parliament, but they were the pacesetters and the trend makers for those of us who have come on after them. Ann has captured that in her book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most wonderful photographs in that book and in the exhibition is of Dorothy Tangney and Enid Lyons together walking in 1943. On the back there is an inscription which says in strine, `A cuppler drunks and may we remain pals for all time'. I think it showed the ability of those women to put aside their political differences, to have some humour and to see that they needed to work together to achieve some of the aims that they had set out to achieve when they came into parliament, now 50 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proud in a very small way that when I was at the opening of that exhibition I suddenly said to Ann in a moment of inspiration, `Ann, you can't lose, this exhibition has to go into a book', and I appreciate the fact that Ann Millar acknowledges that on page 9. She had just finished putting the last bits together&mdash;changing some little mounts and inscriptions&mdash;and was looking pretty exhausted, when I suggested that she might make a book, and I think it was the last thing she wanted to think about. But she has done it. It is a tremendous record. It will be used by many people, especially young people, in Australia because it has that lovely mix of text and picture which helps one to move through what some people might see as a dry topic. Because the book is beautifully put together in an interesting way, people are led through that history. I congratulate Ann on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address the quote from Vida Goldstein that `the all importance of having women in parliament is being demonstrated every day'. She made this comment in 1916 and it is just as pertinent today as it was then. I am sure that my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of this chamber would agree that women bring at times different but equally important perspectives to issues that we deal with in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be true to say that women in this parliament have taken a great interest in many issues, especially social issues but not only social issues. One of the great privileges I had as a member of this parlia</PARA>
<PARA>ment was to attend a delegated legislation conference in London. There we were, not addressing social issues per se, but the issue of delegated legislation. Australia has led the Commonwealth in protecting individuals' rights. It is a committee which very few people outside political life know about. Senator Loosley and I have served on that committee together. It is a committee in which we can put individuals' rights above our political differences and work together, instead of confronting each other, to protect people's rights and to make sure that delegated legislation does not affect them in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were four women at this conference, two from the Labor side and two from the Liberal side. We also had with us our Deputy Clerk who is a female. We must not forget that we have women not only in parliament paving the way but also in important positions serving the Senate and the House of Representatives&mdash;people like Anne Lynch&mdash;paving the way for those women who will serve the people of Australia in those roles. Politicians come and go and we forget that sometimes. Comcar drivers stay longer than we do, so do the clerks and deputy clerks. Our time here is much more ephemeral. In someone like Anne Lynch we have a tremendous role model for women because she has a true commitment to the importance of this place. She has also dedicated a significant part of her life to ensuring that we scrutinise legislation and actually work as a proper house of review. It was tremendous that there were five women at that conference on delegated legislation, which people would not always see as being an issue that women would take up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that my colleagues would also agree that in order to make our public institutions more representative and more democratic we need more women to become involved in the legislative process. While I do not wish to denigrate the achievements of women to date in political life, it is not good enough that only eight per cent of the members of the House of Representatives are women, and it is not good enough that only 21 per cent of senators are women when over 50 per cent of Australians are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am firmly convinced that one of the reasons&mdash;I am not saying all the reasons&mdash;why women have traditionally been under-represented in Australian political life is that sometimes they undervalue their skills and talents and are reluctant to put themselves forward for public office. There are other issues of family responsibilities but that is one reason. Those of us who are here ought to do all we can to encourage other women to see that they are capable of doing this job and making a contribution. We need to educate and encourage other women to take up their cudgels, to put themselves forward for preselection and to join us in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that I am happy with the measures that my party is taking to enhance the opportunity for the recruitment, training and promotion of women into politics. Recently, the Liberal Party has been taking a leading role in the push to encourage more women to stand for political office. Only last month, a national Liberal women's candidate forum was established to provide an opportunity for the Liberal Party to get more women to participate in the electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major objective of the forum is to provide a way for Liberal women around Australia to speak on a wide range of topics advocating women's involvement in contemporary political issues. It will also provide an opportunity for the party to develop a focused campaign to encourage more women to stand for public office. The establishment of this forum is important because it represents the most significant drive for women as candidates in Australia's political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to commend the New South Wales Liberal Women's Council for embarking on a state wide campaign to encourage women to stand for parliament. The council has advertised for women of talent and commitment. By identifying, training and supporting potential women candidates, it will give women a greater chance of winning preselection. I really believe that this is a step in the right direction. One of the reasons why I am a member of this place is that a group of Liberal Party women decided that they would support me in my bid for preselection. In fact, it was not only because of their suggestion that I stand for preselection but also because of their interest and encouragement that I actually represent Victoria here in the Senate today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the strong role women have taken in the formation and development of the Liberal Party itself. Many people are unaware that Australian women played a crucial role in the founding of the Liberal Party. In 1945 the Australian Women's National League was the largest single non-Labor political organisation with over 40,000 financial members, and that was a women's organisation. By voting to amalgamate with the new Liberal Party, these 40,000 women enabled a significant political force to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was partly because of this significant role that women played in the founding of the Liberal Party that their right to have a voice in party decisions was constitutionally protected. In Victoria it is protected to the point where we have equal numbers of men and women in our governing body. I was asked by the press to comment on Mr Carlton's little foray into this issue about whether we should have equal numbers of men and women by having two representatives from each electorate. I, with tongue in cheek, said, `That's one way to ensure that we don't get beyond 50 per cent', and, therefore, I did not approve of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party also has a proud record of women taking an active role in Australian politics. Many of the first women elected to Australian state parliaments have been from the Liberal and conservative parties. We all know that Dame Enid Lyons was the first woman elected to the federal parliament, but not as many people know that the first woman ever elected to a parliament in Australia was Mrs Edith Cowan. She was elected to the lower house of the Western Australian parliament in 1921 for the Nationalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to say how disappointed I was at the recent meeting of women parliamentarians in Canberra to discover that the ratio of women in parliaments around the world has declined over the past five years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not my intention to speak in this debate until Senator Kernot spoke to me. Her motion commemorates not only an important milestone for Australian women but also a very important milestone for all Australians interested in our political process and in the evolution of our democracy. It is entirely appropriate, Madam Acting Deputy President, that you should occupy the chair at this time, given that you, from memory, were the first woman elected from the state of New South Wales to the Australian Senate. That was a first-class political development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot's proposition comprises two different parts: marking the milestone itself and congratulating Ms Ann Millar on her exhibition and book, both of which are first class. I attended the original exhibition last year. It has become an integral part of the Australian parliamentary scene, of Australian parliamentary life. One wonders at the impact on many tens of thousands of Australians who have had the opportunity to see that exhibition over the previous year. I hope that it becomes a permanent fixture of the parliament. It commemorates significant dates, events and personalities and demonstrates the evolution of our political process and the magnificent contributions that have been made by a small but growing number of Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was one element of Senator Kernot's motion that I particularly wanted to take up. Of the 59 women who have served in the Australian federal parliament, some 30 are currently serving. That raises the question: why now? The answer is that women political candidates, generally speaking, are very well attuned to the needs of electorates, in particular, marginal electorates. They have tended to be politically more attractive to constituents and politically more responsive to the demands and aspirations of constituents. That has been as true of state politics as it has been of federal politics. There is no doubt in my mind now, not only from the experience of the Labor Party but also from the broader experience of all the political parties, that women candidates in marginal seats are great political assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking more broadly at the achievements of women in international politics, the Speaker of the House of Commons, Ms Betty Boothroyd, was elected on a bipartisan basis. The Japanese Diet has a woman Speaker, Ms Takako Doi, for the first time. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has referred to the President of Ireland, Mrs Robinson, as being in a great many respects the model for a future Australian head of state. If anyone has been following the hearings before the United States Congress house ways and means committee just this week on the American health system, they will know that Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton has demonstrated beyond doubt that it will not be very long before the president of the United States is a woman. That threshold argument is now won in terms of the capacities of women to contribute in any number of spheres of public life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enjoyed Senator Patterson's contribution. She was absolutely right in saying that it is very important at times to put notions of partisanship to one side and focus upon issues. That has certainly been the case with the regulations and ordinances committee on which I had the privilege to serve as chair. I have no doubt that a lot of that capacity is reflected in our parliament by the presence of an increasing number of very able Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a little uneasy some years ago when the ALP introduced quotas for women's participation. I am no longer uneasy. There is no doubt in my mind that it has made our party's organisation and policy making far better. It encouraged a greater number of women to contest and win public office preselections, and go into public office at the different levels of Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot was right to speak to me. Not only is it important for women to celebrate this milestone, but also it is important for all Australians to celebrate and commemorate it. On my behalf and, I am sure, on behalf of everyone in the chamber and beyond I commend Senator Kernot for her motion and Ann Millar for a magnificent exhibition and book. We look forward to the evolution of the exhibition and future publications of the book and also to a steady improvement in the numbers of Australian women present in, making a contribution to and changing the face of our politics for the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support Senator Kernot's motion. It has been supported by everybody in the chamber who has spoken on it, and I am not surprised that that is the case. There is not the slightest doubt that 1943 was a significant year in this country. We were at war and that dominated what occurred. It was also a year when women's organisations throughout Australia realised that they had to make a supreme effort to capitalise on what had occurred at the beginning of the century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back earlier than the beginning of the century, New Zealand is now celebrating 100 years of women's suffrage. Next year South Australia celebrates it, a state where, as Senator Crowley pointed out, women achieved not only the right to vote but also the right to sit in parliament. In 1902 the Commonwealth Franchise Act gave women the right to vote and to sit in the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until 1943, some 41 long years ago, there had been a number of women candidates for the federal parliament over the years but no woman had been elected. Edith Cowan sat in the parliament of Western Australia in 1921 and May Holman was a member of the Western Australian parliament in 1925. But for 41 long years, women were not present in this parliament. It was not that they had not tried or that they had not been active. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard mention tonight in the debate of Vida Goldstein of Victoria, a woman who stood for parliament on five occasions between 1903 and 1917. She was a tireless worker, an effective speaker, a writer and editor. She published her own journals. She went to the United Kingdom with Dora Meeson to take part in the coronation suffragette procession on 17 June 1911 when the magnificent banner which bore the words, `Trust the women' was marched through the streets of England to encourage the British to give women the right to vote in that country, as had happened earlier in this country. It was not until 1918 that women in England over the age of 30 obtained the right to vote. It was not until 1928 that women over the age of 21 were given the right to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One cannot discuss these times without thinking of Rose Scott and Louisa Lawson, women who were extremely active in New South Wales. I love the writing on the photograph of Rose Scott in 1902&mdash;`Rose Scott&mdash;enfranchised, 1902'. None of us sitting here tonight could imagine not being franchised. We were born with the right to vote. To have had to fight for it is something that we can only read about and imagine. The simple phrase on that photograph says so much about what these women had gone through to achieve what really ought to have been a right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rose Scott set up the women's political education league. She was instrumental in establishing the National Council of Women. She went on lecture tours. She was the secretary of the Dawn Club, that phrase coming from the book written by Louisa Lawson, who was also of those times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, Catherine Helen Spence is somebody whom I particularly think about. She was part of the Women's Suffrage League and is said to have been the greatest woman of the 19th century. She certainly was a formidable woman. She was the first woman to stand for election in that she was a candidate for the 1887 convention. She was not successful but she was eligible to stand and she did stand. I claim that she would have been the first woman to have sought election in that way. She was a suffragist, a preacher, a journalist, a novelist, an educationalist, a strong woman and a model whom we can still look to today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1943 there was a big effort, and it was successful. In that year there was a conference in Sydney of 91 women's organisations including the National Council of Women, the Australian Women's National League, the Council for Action for Equal Pay, the United Association of Women&mdash;the organisation that Jessie Street was so involved with&mdash;the League of Women Voters, the Women for Canberra Movement, women's service guilds, the Union of Australian Women, the Business and Professional Women's Club, the Women Graduates Association, Soroptimists, the Young Women's Christian Association and the Country Women's Association. The political parties were also there, as well as many others. Many issues were important to them, such as equal pay and child care, but I think their main aim was to do something about getting women elected to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The election on 24 August 1943 was the turning point. There were 24 women candidates in that election and two were elected&mdash;not a very high percentage, but I think it tells us that the more women candidates there are, the more likely it is that some will be elected. If there are only a few, perhaps there is an expectation that women are not quite the thing. If there are a lot of women candidates, it is more likely that the electorate will respond and recognise that there ought to be women and then there will be women elected from that number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, as Marian Sawer said after the March election this year, the major political parties are still very reluctant to endorse women for winnable seats. I think the facts indicate that. It is also apparent that women have been elected more readily to the Senate than to the House of Representatives. It was with considerable dismay that only recently I heard one of the senior Labor members of this chamber indicate that he would like to do away with proportional representation for the election of the Senate and elect on some other basis. Presumably he is conscious of what that would mean in terms of the number of women who are here at present. I think there are very good reasons other than that as to why the Senate's electoral system should remain as it is. I think that he did not really care too much about that aspect when he made the suggestion that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 1943 it really was not a very rosy or rapid advance. Doris Blackburn joined Enid Lyons in the House of Representatives in 1946 and remained until 1949. Dame Enid was there until 1951. This might be irrelevant to this debate, but it is something that I feel conscious of today: a week ago today some Australian soldiers were killed in a motor vehicle accident in Malaysia. One of them was the great grandson of Dame Enid Lyons and son of a friend of mine, who was buried in Melbourne today. Although it is not quite relevant to the debate, somehow it seems somewhat poignant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Dame Enid left the House of Representatives it took 17 years until another woman was elected there. I think it is only in recent times that the significance of that has really come home to me. That woman was Kay Brownbill, from my own state&mdash;at that time&mdash;of South Australia. I knew her. She was there for only three years. To have gone as a woman on her own into the House of Representatives at that time must have been difficult. I would say that those of us here today for whom life has been considerably easier perhaps do not fully understand the contribution that she made in those three short years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Kay Brownbill left in 1969, it was another five years before there was a woman in the House of Representatives. That was Joan Child, and she served then for only a short time. In 1980 she returned to the House of Representatives with a number of women&mdash;not a big number, not one to get carried away by, but at least more than one. Since then there have been few&mdash;but a greater number than in the past&mdash;in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came into the Senate there were nine women. I certainly did not feel alone in coming into this chamber, and nor should I have. It has been much easier for those of us here in the 1980s and 1990s. We can only reflect on the contribution made by the women who came here in 1943 through until the 1980s and 1990s, but I still think it is the women who were here between the turn of the century and 1943 who made an incredible contribution. Knowing that they were getting knocked back at every turn, they kept fighting on because they knew they had to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the honour of being asked to launch the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS> earlier this week. It is launched to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the election of women to this parliament. It is a splendid book which will be used by students of political history and those interested in women's role in the parliament for a very long time. We are indebted to Ann Millar for having put it together. Ann Millar put together the exhibition that is still to be seen in this parliament called Trust the Women, which is centred around the banner which I referred to, created by Dora Meeson and taken to England from Australia. One of the really good things from the bicentenary that is permanent is the fact that that banner was purchased by the bicentennial fund, returned to Australia, and is now in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This book has magnificent pictures and is very readable. At the back are all the charts that show the details. They are impressive because of the sparseness of women representatives in earlier time. It has an excellent source section which gives the primary and secondary sources. Honourable senators will spend a long time going through all those sources familiarising themselves with the history. It has in it the maiden speech of Dame Enid Lyons, given 50 years ago today in the House of Representatives, and that of Senator Dorothy Tangney, the first woman to have spoken in the Senate, delivered in the Senate 50 years ago last Friday. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put the National Party on record as recognising the role of women in the political process, which I believe is second to none. The National Party does not at the moment have any female representatives in the federal parliament although I must say that former Senator Florence Bjelke-Petersen was here in the last parliament.

I believe that she is the first woman to hold such a position in a political party in Australia. I believe it was the National Party also which had the first female federal president of a political party in Shirley McKerrow, some years ago. I regret that there are no female National Party members in either the House of Representatives or the Senate at the moment representing women in their own right. I say again that we all miss Flo in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party also had the first female general secretary of a state political party in New South Wales in Jenny Gardiner. She was appointed at the time I was the chairman of the party in New South Wales. The National Party's record of having women on our central council I believe also is second to none and I think the majority of representatives on our central council would agree that the women there play a major role in forming policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the New South Wales state parliament we have Wendy Machin, who is a minister there, and in other states we also have female members. Jenny Gardiner, who was the general secretary in New South Wales, is now an MLC in the upper house of New South Wales. I do not really believe that the National Party is lagging behind although, as I said, it is sad to me that the we do not have any women representatives in the Senate at the moment. The National Party has stood some outstanding women candidates in recent election campaigns and their contributions to the party remain, despite the fact that they were not successful. One of those persons is Gaye White, who is in the parliament at the moment working for one of our newest senators. </PARA>

She reminded me of a delightful saying of a well-known political female figure of her day: `I know I am a woman. I hope I am always a lady'. I think that exemplifies the point I would like to make that titles are irrelevant. Whether male or female, it is the contribution people make to this place that is the most important thing. I believe each has a role to play in making a better society. </PARA>

Whether we are males or females, it is the support we get from our partners or spouses that gives us the energy and the drive to continue working for what we believe in. I think the old adage that behind every successful man is a very intelligent and supportive woman is not so appropriate today.

We have worked on that committee in the last parliament and in this parliament as a team. I think that the great virtues that women bring to parliament are that they have a viewpoint and an empathy with the community that exceeds that of the male. We are complementary, one to the other, as we are on those committees. </PARA>

Gender balance for the Greens (WA) is not something to be artificially structured, not even to be consciously striven for, but more looked at as an indication of health within our organisation. We believe that to have an imbalance, whether it be of gender or of any particular minority group not having power or a choice, needs to be addressed. Our community is changing. Women are emerging from structures that have held them back for years.</PARA></TALK.START>

However, we must not forget that simply to have numbers is not the purpose of that change. It is to make sure that the full balance of the voices of our community can be heard at a political level. As Senator Brownhill mentioned, that balance can be injected not simply by domination of a particular gender, but by looking at the contribution that women make, whether it is unseen or visible. I think there is an invisible or unacknowledged contribution and I am very grateful to Senator Brownhill for pointing that out. I was beginning to be afraid that the debate would degenerate just into congratulating ourselves on having women here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I seek leave to incorporate by consent in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> two tabling statements of Senator John Watson in relation to superannuation reports which were presented and tabled during the recess. The first is the tabling statement of the sixth report on superannuation, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fees, charges and commissions</EMPHASIS>; the second is on the seventh report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super inquiry overview</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statements read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Tabling of the Sixth Report on Super-Fees, Charges and Commissions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sixth report is the second last report on the committee's original 17 terms of reference. This report was prepared under the active and dedicated chairmanship of Senator Sherry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Senator Sherry's leadership the committee met on 93 occasions during a two year long inquiry and it is a tribute to the work of the chair and also the members that on only about 2 or 3 occasions did the committee divide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By any standard that is a remarkable achievement and is evidence of the potential that parliamentary committees have to break down party political differences which are often based on ideology as opposed to sound logic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report on fees, charges and commissions was indeed a difficult task, possibly the most complex issue which the committee has thus far addressed. To arrive at a final package of reforms the committee tabled an interim report, an issues paper which floated options for reform, and a report on its tripartite Super Consumer Seminar. The final package of reforms recommended by the committee has been given a high degree of scrutiny by both the committee and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report has been based on evidence before the committee from a range of interest groups but the committee relied heavily on the 50 or so individual case studies which are detailed in the report. The committee also relied on parallel reports handed down by the ALRC and the TPC and, on behalf of the committee, I congratulate both agencies on their work in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was unanimous in the view that all is not well in the personal superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry is in drastic need of microeconomic reform to bring it to a position where it can offer high value but low cost products in keeping with the new superannuation environment. That environment is open, competitive and lean.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will need to recognise this and bring the industry into line with developments in other financial sectors. Also, the Government will need to inject and instil a higher degree of confidence in the industry than is presently the case. The revamped and better resourced ISC should play the role of the catalyst in this structural change process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the change does not occur, the whole retirement incomes strategy will be at risk. The job of the Government will be to look at the Committee's report and implement its recommendations as soon as possible. . . otherwise the community will become increasingly more disgruntled about super policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MLC Super Index is an interesting barometer of super confidence. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the most recent data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to report that the two major interest groups LIFA and the Australian Consumers Association have made positive public statements about the overall thrust of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report was well timed because in the weeks following its presentation, the Cabinet agreed on a package of reforms which is closely aligned to that of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that it has struck the right balance in formulating a package of reforms which will empower consumers to allow them to make more informed decisions in purchasing super products. The key elements of the package are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agents should disclose any initial and on-going commissions before contracts are entered into.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee calls on the ISC, in conjunction with the industry and consumers, to develop a five year strategy to increase the level of consumer awareness about superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that consumer counselling services be provided by the ISC in each of its capital city/regional offices. In this context I would inform the Senate of the ISC's undertaking to set up an office in each of the state capitals. I am deeply concerned that the ISC may be considering to break this promise and not proceed to establish an office in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the industry establish its own agent registration system, together with a code of conduct to be approved by the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee awaits with interest the formal government response to this report and the other reports for which a response has not as yet been given. . . .namely, the third, fourth and fifth reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Seventh Report-Super Inquiry Overview</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Seventh report of the Select Committee on Superannuation entitled Super Inquiry Overview will receive the plaudits of the Government because, unlike the previous six reports, it does not contain any recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does however contain a considerable number of dictums on superannuation policy in general and the role of the committee in influencing that policy in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report should be compulsory reading for any new Senator about to embark on the `argy bargy' of committee life. It demonstrates that the procedures which govern Senate committees are living and breathing instruments which give Senate inquiries powers which other parliamentary and quasi-judicial bodies do not have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It contains more than 60 pages describing and analysing the evolution of the Select Committee on Superannuation during its first two years of inquiry and the impact that the committee has had on policy formulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That impact was only made possible because the committee elected to break its mammoth task down into seven digestible pieces or reports. This report describes how that break down occurred. In doing so the report identifies those themes which emerged again and again throughout the inquiry. These themes included:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should be the goals of a sound retirement incomes system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To what extent should voluntarism and compulsion or a combination of both drive the system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should be the appropriate level of government intervention to protect consumers of super products?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the micro and macro economic implications of superannuation-related policy options?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report shows that a successful committee inquiry needs a high degree of organisational and managerial input from all members and that is what occurred during this inquiry. It demonstrates that the committee relied on quality evidence to arrive at conclusions and to make recommendations to influence the shape of retirement incomes policy. So good was this evidence that the committee did not need to engage consultants to assist in the preparation of the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead the committee relied on the combined expertise of government departments, individuals and umbrella organisations representing the interests of superannuation funds, for example, ASFA&mdash;the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia. In this context I would advise the Senate that the Executive Director of ASFA, Brian Scullin, has recently been appointed to a new position in the banking industry. Both the Committee and the superannuation industry will greatly miss his considerable expertise and leadership and I wish him well in his new venture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sweep of super policy is broad, its impact on individuals is profound and its potential to create confusion and uncertainty is great and it is for these reasons that the Senate has agreed to extend the life of the Select Committee on Superannuation. As the new chair of the committee I will endeavour to ensure that the committee maintains its active role in scrutinising the policy and operations of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank the Senate for the opportunity of speaking in support of the committee's seventh report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to report No. 42 of the Standing Committee of Privileges into the treatment of James Gaffey by the Australian Securities Commission. In doing so, I will be making various comments in respect to, in particular, Mr Ron Trevethan, the Regional Commissioner, Victoria of the Australian Securities Commission, who is of course one of the important persons mentioned in the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why I speak on this matter&mdash;and I am not a member of the committee&mdash;is that I have recently made personal inquiries into this matter which have led me to believe that to impose any additional penalty upon the two Australian Securities Commission officers involved would be unjust and, indeed, an improper application of the Senate's authority. For the benefit of the Senate, I would like to indicate the facts which lead me to this conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ron Trevethan is the Regional Commissioner, the responsible head of the ASC in Victoria. The commission is a significant entity in Victoria. It has over 200 employees, a considerable number of whom are professionally qualified. It is organised into sections within which supervisors perform the ASC's several monitoring and compliance responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central complainant in respect of the privileges committee inquiry, James Gaffey, was at the time a junior legal officer in one of those sections. Over some period he had developed a reputation for adverse behavioural problems with his office colleagues, and there was also concern over the professional quality of his work. Eventually these shortcomings came to a head with his shouting at and using intimidatory language and conduct towards his immediate supervisor, a Mrs Anne Dalton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, he was instructed to appear before Mr Trevethan for formal counselling as to what was appropriate behaviour. Mr Gaffey's attitude thereafter became increasingly defiant of any authority, so I am advised, and over the period of the following two months he successfully avoided appointments for the consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conscious of the adverse effect this was having upon discipline within the ASC, Mr Trevethan felt obliged to charge Mr Gaffey with a failure to fulfil his duty as an officer and asked the Victorian ASC's regional counsel, Ms Mardi Waters, to draw a charge to that effect. In turn, she sought advice from the Australian Government Solicitor's office, which office in fact drew up the charge citing six behavioural complaints, including the offending one which has led to the report of the privileges committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That offending charge drawn by the Government Solicitor's office was to the effect that, some five months before the unacceptable conduct incident and in violation of the Public Service Act, Mr Gaffey had given evidence in public to the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities, which was directly contrary to that which had been submitted by the ASC itself, and was thus seen as compromising the commission. The unintended contempt implication of that charge was appreciated almost immediately. Mr Trevethan was advised and, eight days after the charge was laid, he apologised and caused it to be withdrawn. The other five charges remained standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of my investigations, I believe that Mr Trevethan's contempt was completely inadvertent; that the offending conduct was remedied by him personally immediately its effect was appreciated. The offence passed unnoticed through legal counsel and the Government Solicitor's office; indeed, it was initiated by the latter&mdash;that is, by the Government Solicitor's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Trevethan's sole motivation in this matter was to maintain proper discipline in his office in the face of a determined abuse of such discipline. He also appreciated and acted at all times in accordance with the Public Service regulations, which are not framed with these circumstances in mind. The ASC has supported the initiatives proposed by the privileges committee and is developing within its own organisation an information program to achieve the objective outlined by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago I was very pleased to receive a letter from the chairman of the ASC, Mr Cameron, dated 8 September, advising of the Australian Securities Commission training seminar, entitled `Accountability to the houses of Parliament and parliamentary committees'. In the letter inviting me to attend the seminar and, indeed, to speak at it, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To implement the recommendation of the Senate Committee of Privileges recommendation from the 42nd Report "Possible Adverse Treatment of a Witness before the Corporations and Securities Committee" the ASC will be conducting the above Training Seminar at its Regional Office in Melbourne on 1 November 1993. The programme is aimed at Senior Executive Service staff together with appropriate Senior Officers in the Victorian Regional Office and the Office of the Chairman at Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have greatly appreciated the assistance of the staff of the Senate Procedures Office in helping my own staff develop the proposed programme. I believe that the presentation of the Seminar would be greatly enhanced by the participation of a Senator in delivering the key element of the Seminar.</PARA>
<PARA>I was somewhat honoured to then be invited to attend the seminar. Unfortunately, I very much regret that I will not be able to because I will not be here. The important point I want to make is that the ASC has acted promptly and very well in response to the situation that was revealed and that it found itself in as a result of the work of the privileges committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I would like to make in explaining to the Senate why I have come to the view that I have is that in a formal submission the chairman of the ASC expressed his belief that individual officers should not be cited for contempt because the lack of knowledge of the Senate's privilege was a failing on the part of the ASC itself&mdash;in other words, the whole commission&mdash;and, indeed, across the whole public sector. It is a matter of concern that in attempting to press the point that senior officers in public agencies should have a better understanding of parliamentary privilege, the committee has chosen to make an example of Mr Trevethan `to encourage the others'. That is what the privileges committee report said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having heard from some of those involved and understanding this chronicle of events, I have come to be strongly of the opinion that Mr Trevethan was and is innocent of any intent to hold this Senate in contempt&mdash;that his endeavours to administer his office in a wholly appropriate manner inadvertently led to his becoming involved in this way. Under advice, he thus committed an inadvertent breach which he immediately remedied and for which he publicly apologised. The officers under his administration legally have very significant powers of public investigation and conduct and he personally places great importance on the fact that they conduct themselves properly and do not exceed that power. Their behaviour in all respects ranks highly amongst Mr Trevethan's own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also relevant to note that one of our most senior professional bodies, in full possession of the facts of this matter, recently elected Mr Trevethan as its Victorian president. In all the circumstances, I believe that to add further to the personal suffering which I know Mr Trevethan has already endured would not constitute the pursuit of justice but would be a travesty of justice and not a correct application of the authority of this Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is the manner in which it has been brought on. As the secretary has informed me, there has been an attempt to bring this matter on on several occasions and now it has been brought on without it being on the order of business&mdash;the red. That causes me some concern because, if we accept the recommendation of the committee, we find two people guilty of contempt of parliament, which is a very serious matter in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this parliament become used to the circumstances here. We have exchanges across the floor, we make pronouncements and we become inured to the effect that those pronouncements might have on people outside this place. As Senator Short has said, Mr Trevethan has become quite disturbed by this matter. I wonder whether or not we should deal with these recommendations before the Senate in a different fashion.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breach of parliamentary privilege or contempt of parliament is a grave matter and a decision about its commission should be made with considerable caution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the evidence in this matter is not sufficient to support a finding of contempt of Parliament against Ms Waters. Accordingly I find she did not commit a breach of parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to convince this Senate to support the minority report. The mechanisms of the way this place works and the circumstances in which these matters come before the Senate make that nigh impossible. The concern that Senator Short expresses about the findings against Mr Trevethan about Margot Waters are similar to mine, except that he said that Mr Trevethan committed the contempt, but did so without intent. I think that would be the general feeling of the committee. Having searched the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcripts of evidence, my position is that there was just no evidence against her at all. </PARA>

After the charges were prepared, he had them served through the agency of Ms Waters. So although there is evidence against him, there is no evidence that Ms Waters laid the charges or joined in the decision to commence them. The evidence is very worrying from the point of view of having this particular charge of contempt of parliament found against her.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Short was saying that he has concerns about Mr Trevethan. He has not had the opportunity to discuss his concerns or put them in a way that might convince this Senate. What is happening tonight in respect of Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters is that we, as a Senate, are finding them guilty of contempt, but we really do not have the facts in the way the committee did. </PARA>

I think we too easily and too readily endorse a finding that may well be correct&mdash;given the research, the investigations and the great knowledge that the committee brought to this. It probably is right. Nevertheless, if there is doubt, can we, simply on the basis of a recommendation, make the findings we are about to make? As a parliament, we have to look at this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the committee to find them guilty of contempt. Fair enough. That binds the committee. But the Senate is the body that will find them guilty without them having the opportunity to address us, which is well nigh impossible, or having someone set out their case in some form. Enough senators might then get to the point where they say, `Thank you very much, privileges committee, for the magnificent work you have done, but on this occasion we think it is appropriate to make a finding that there was no contempt of parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen now is that we will have a vote; this will go through. Senator Short has spoken about the high integrity of and the high regard held by his fellows for one person; I am saying that Ms Waters seems to be in much the same position. Yet the whole 76 of us in the Senate are about to say that those two people are guilty of the very grave offence of contempt of the Senate of the federal parliament of Australia. I think that is very drastic action for us to be taking here tonight. Although this motion is about to go through now, we will all have the responsibility for voting in favour of a finding that these two people committed a breach of parliamentary privilege and that they are in contempt of parliament, and they will wear that for the rest of their days. </PARA>

I conclude my brief remarks by urging the government to give this a very high priority. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My name is                         I am a fourteen-year old student. My father who I do not see anymore abused me sexually, mentally and physically. He took my mother to court everytime I did not want to visit him. He would ask the court for access or custody. I would go to counselling sessions and felt as if I wasn't being listened to. He would always get access and my mother would be left in debt because of legal costs. Every time I went to my father's house he would abuse me.

I do not think it is the government's response; it is an interim response and does not go as far as a full response ultimately will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken up the major thrust of the recommendations contained in our report on the Close Corporations Act. The Close Corporations Act was passed through this parliament&mdash;as the term implies, it is an act&mdash;but ran into constitutional difficulties and was never proclaimed. Our committee was given the task of looking at it. We skirted around the country getting views on whether it was an appropriate vehicle for the needs of small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Close Corporations Act tried to introduce a new form of incorporation for small businesses. It was designed to introduce a simple structure that was less onerous in reporting requirements but which still offered the advantages of limited liability. While there was support for the need for a simpler vehicle to provide incorporation for small businesses in the evidence presented to the committee when we went around the country, most witnesses gave only limited support to the Close Corporations Act itself or as the most appropriate type of vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the criticisms of the proposal was that the restrictions on its powers would render it unsuitable for small business and that limited liability could be lost relatively easily. Interestingly, we also found that the whole concept of limited liability did not provide a major incentive for small business; it is not a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another criticism was that the structure and reporting requirements of the Close Corporations Act remain complex and that there is no simple process for converting a close corporation into a proprietary company. The committee instead recommended the introduction of a new corporate form called the private company. It proposed that this be enacted as a new chapter in the Corporations Law; that it be written in plain English to make it a little different from the rest of the Corporations Law, which is becoming more and more complex, onerous and difficult to follow; that its establishment be simple and cheap; that its reporting obligations be minimal; that its internal administration be simple and uncomplicated; that there be a simple process for dispute resolution between members of the private company; that the vehicle should offer the normal benefits of incorporation; that the transition to a more complex corporate structure should be simple in order to accommodate the growth of a business; and that the structure should be tax effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government's interim response does not adopt all these features, the discussion paper circulated by the Attorney-General on 15 July&mdash;the day after the letter to me that has been tabled as the interim response&mdash;includes a summary of them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 November 1989 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It was not until 17 December 1990 that the government ratified the convention. On 22 December 1992 the Attorney-General made a declaration with respect to the convention in accordance with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previously stated by Senator Vanstone, the coalition has no opposition to the convention as such and what it stands for. However, notwithstanding the subsequent ratification and declaration by the Attorney-General, there has been a great deal of concern about this in the community. My office and, I believe, those of fellow senators have been inundated with correspondence on this very matter. Nearly three years after ratification, concerns are being widely expressed about the effect that this convention might have on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the opinion voiced has been that this convention tends to undermine the authority of parents and those in whose legitimate authority children are placed. As well as that, there has been complaint that insufficient time has been given to the discussion of this convention before either ratification was made or the declaration was made by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to note in the debate we had yesterday on religious freedom that there were some 11 years between the adoption by the United Nations and ratification by this country. It would seem that two years is a very small period within which to discuss a most important subject as this. In any event I ask fellow senators who spoke on this matter to remember that part A of the motion moved by Senator Vanstone states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) recognises:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)  that everyone is entitled to fundamental rights and freedoms without distinction such as based on race, sex, religion or nationality, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) that the child by reason of physical immaturity needs special safeguards and care;</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not a question of the coalition being hardnosed in relation to this convention. It is not a question of the coalition denying that such rights should be recognised or afforded to children. It is, in fact, nothing of the sort. It is simply the fact that there is some reservation about the declaration by the Attorney-General in relation to this matter and the subsequent effect that the declaration might have on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, let us look at the convention. The convention comprises 54 articles. I was not in this place when the ratification took place, but I believe there are some aspects of it which could give rise to some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Articles 12 to 16 were singled out in correspondence that I have received as being the areas of main concern. The comments that I have received are that these articles deal with the freedom of children to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, freedom of association and that there should be no arbitrary interference with the privacy of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such that is all very well. That deals with the rights of the child per se, but the criticism has been in relation to the lack of comment on the role of the parent. Now I understand that the Australian delegation was responsible for insertion of article 5, which states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fear is that although the declaration might be a starting point for practices adopted by the Commonwealth&mdash;as stated by Senator Bolkus&mdash;it could well extend into Commonwealth legislation. The fear is exactly what interpretation would be placed on article 5 as opposed to articles 12 to 16 and how it relates to domestic legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand the position in Europe, there is the Treaty of Rome whereby European countries acknowledge that they will be bound by such conventions and they will have consequential domestic legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting point was made in an article written by Neville Turner in the January-February 1992 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Law Institute Journal</EMPHASIS>. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This article has sought to identify issues that the N.C.B.A.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the National Children's Bureau of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">might well concern itself with in its role of implementing and monitoring the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. But it is, I believe, readily apparent that the legal profession also has a major role to play in ensuring that it is translated into reality.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an article that goes into the matter in some depth. It betrays the thinking behind this and that is that lawyers have a role in translating this convention into reality. What it is about is not just the convention providing some sort of guidance for Commonwealth practice, but in translating it into day to day living for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The disallowance of this motion in no way detracts from Australia's international obligations on the matter. Australia, as I think Senator Watson said, is one the freest countries in the world. With 15 years legal experience, I can say that in areas of family law and in the jurisdiction of the children's courts, more than sufficient regard is had to the rights of the child. For instance, section 64(2) of the Family Law Act provides that in relation to access, custody, guardianship and matters touching on the welfare of a child `the court shall regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration'. Indeed, two striking examples in that act illustrate the point that I am making. Previously the wishes of the child in relation to custody and access were regarded when the child was age 14 or more. That has been done away with and the court assesses the child's wishes according to the maturity of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, separate representation is provided for a child in a variety of circumstances. From my experience in the Family Court, it is not uncommon for a child to have separate representation and legal aid can be provided for that to be done. In Western Australia there is ample provision for abused children or neglected children. In fact, under state legislation the relevant department takes out a care and protection order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I have heard today in this chamber, it would seem that if we do not allow this declaration to stand, all sorts of calamity and chaos will befall children in this country and the whole question of human rights will be thrown into question. That is simply not the case. As I say, Australia has a very good record. When we look at other countries and say, `They have not applied a reservation to the ratification of this convention', we could well say that those countries had better follow us rather than that we follow them. When one looks at the rights of citizens over the age of 18&mdash;and the convention applies to people under the age of 18&mdash;one sees that there are very few countries in Asia, South America, and especially Africa, that could tell Australia anything about children's rights or human rights in general. I believe that this country is one of the leaders of the world in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my time practising in the law, I discovered in a very practical way the problems that face children who are the victims of abuse and neglect. I can relate to the Senate a case where I was representing one child, a female aged 15, who wanted to obtain bail on a charge that she faced, but she could not obtain it because she had nowhere to live. I set out to find her a place to stay so that she could be granted bail. I approached the relevant welfare department and made inquiries there, but I also contacted the relevant voluntary welfare agencies, such as Centacare, the Wesley Central Mission and another one run by the Uniting Church. It was not the government department that got back to me pretty quickly. It was the churches and the voluntary welfare agencies that got back with a secure place to stay for this young girl who was virtually living on the streets. Those are the practical problems we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the debate that we can have on some convention will not help any child in that sort of position. It will not help an abused or neglected child. I have seen people in my office who have been underprivileged and who have been really down on their luck, and what those people need is economic security and employment. It is only in that way that they can provide for their children or fulfil any sort of duty as a parent. Those are the questions we should be looking at, not some airy-fairy convention and declaration that we think will change the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the more practical element of what causes children to come into conflict with the law and end up on the streets? I would like to refer the Senate to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Couchman </EMPHASIS>program on 9 May 1990. It was during the course of that program that a mother, Brenda Rowlands, related a story. It was Peter Couchman who put the question to her as to why she was there and what her concerns were. He asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What happened with you and your son?</PARA>
<PARA>She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I'm most concerned about it because what happened with my son, happened four years ago, pre-Convention; the Convention had nothing to do with it. But my son, from about the age of 15, decided he didn't like school, he didn't like being told what to do as in doing homework or anything else, and he was advised of his rights by his teachers, so he came home at about 15 and a half and said, `Oh, when I'm 16, the law says I can leave home'. The law didn't specifically say he could leave home, but it said that I couldn't get him to come back, which amounted to the same thing.</PARA>
<PARA>Couchman said to Mrs Rowlands, `So he left'. She replied, `So at 16, he left'. Couchman went on to say, `Who did he live with?  Who became his guardian?'. Mrs Rowlands replied, somewhat sadly, `Well, he left and slept in refuges and knocked around the streets a bit. I don't know what he did because he cut himself off from us, because that is what he wanted to do'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I can tell you that that story is not in isolation. I have represented hundreds and hundreds of children in the last 15 years in the Children's Court of Western Australia and that story is familiar.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What children need is a secure family background and a good education. With that start in life they will have some sort of future. This notion that a child aged 15 or 16 can simply do what this boy did in relation to his family life, strike out and end up on the streets, is absolutely fallacious. The whole question of the role of a parent needs to be looked at in society. We have to look at the duties and responsibilities of parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on that subject I would venture to say that there are a good many people who become parents without understanding the responsibilities that attach to that. That is at the base of the problem of juvenile crime and the problems facing youth today. I can tell the Senate that the majority of children I represented came from a broken background or a situation where they were left to fend for themselves at an early age. It was uncommon, to say the least, to have a child on a charge who came from a secure and stable family environment or who had a good education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that a person under the age of 18 has special protection from the law for a very good reason. That is because they need nurturing; they need protection; they need assistance; and they need an upbringing to prepare themselves for the future. But trying to translate these sort of rights into the law by saying, `This will be a panacea. It will sort things out. It will suddenly make a lot of children better overnight' is completely without foundation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The waterfront dispute, temporarily settled yesterday, came near to paralysing Australia's trade on a day when the balance of payments showed that we are still on the slippery slide to a banana republic. The naval deployment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of 46 cargo ships carrying 20,000 containers cost over $2 million to shipping companies and exporters while the ships lay idle off the Australian coast. The meter certainly ticks over while ships rest at anchor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, admitted in an answer to a question asked by me on Monday, the strike was `not in the least helpful to Australia's export industries'. It was a strike that will remind our trading partners that we still have some of the world's most unreliable ports. We are unreliable. We are not dependable. If foreign countries have a choice of sourcing their raw materials or manufactured goods elsewhere, they will do so. I would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strike arose after a threat by the maritime union of Australia that `years of industrial disruption' would follow if Australian stevedores took redundancy action against 313 surplus workers after a recent merging of stevedoring companies. Australian Stevedores was formed on 1 July from a merger of National Terminals Australia and Strang Patrick. The new company has determined that this number was surplus to its waterfront work force of 2,000 people. At last week's hearing, the unions warned of `an almighty dispute that would teach the employer a lesson' if enforced redundancy was implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's conspiracy with the waterfront unions to keep true labour market reforms out of the expensive reform process over the last three years has come home to roost with this current strike. The crunch issue in the strike is redundancy&mdash;in other words, the job for life concept so dear to the standover dinosaurs of another age which still survive here. The union has stated flatly that it will not abide by any decision that insists on compulsory redundancies. It is this refusal to come to terms with the contemporary commercial realities, however unpalatable they may be, that has led to the current crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one likes to be told that their job is no longer viable, but it is a commercial fact of life for almost everybody else. For decades the waterfront has been quarantined from the real world of commerce and has developed a reputation of dishonesty and inefficiency that will be a measure of industrial bloody-mindedness for some time. It was because of the total inefficiency of the waterfront that the government was forced to embark on the three-year waterfront reform program which was completed in October 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 4,479 employees left the industry under extremely generous terms. The cost of the redundancy payments was $413 million, of which the Commonwealth contributed $165 million. The remainder of the cost to the industry was paid by shipping companies through a levy. A further $20 million was contributed for additional departures in response to an idle time list, to which shipping companies are refusing to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the end of the program, the government's priorities have been centred on studies by bodies such as the Prices Surveillance Authority and the Trade Practices Commission to determine whether the savings, claimed by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority to be in the order of $300 million, have been passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's aim is to produce evidence that its reforms have produced savings both in ship turnaround times and in actual costs. Since end users have, with the exception of a few customers, denied that they have received cost benefits, the government has sought to lay the blame for this elsewhere. One of its targets, with some justification, has been port authorities. Port authority reform has now been placed on the agenda by Mr Keating. The government, of course, previously mocked the opposition for urging port authority reform on the grounds that the Commonwealth did not own the ports. Labor has unfortunately stopped short of the right policy position that privatisation is the preferred outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipping lines have pointed out that turnaround times have improved markedly and that this represents a saving for them. They also claim, however, that shipping rates have been at bargain basement levels&mdash;in terms of on-water costs&mdash;for some time and that they have a margin lag to make up before they are able to pass on any savings to end users. So despite $400 million being spent to persuade 4,479 surplus wharfies to retire early and their $100,000 golden handshakes on top of their already generous retirement benefits, including cash in lieu of unused sick leave&mdash;a perk virtually unknown anywhere else in the work force&mdash;the problem of market force redundancy was squibbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was squibbed because the problem of labour market structure, as it affects the waterfront, is security of tenure held by wharfies. There is no real labour flexibility, and this was not addressed. So only partial reform was achieved after so much money. There is no change of the culture on the waterfront. The one-off adjustment that the redundancy program produced has not brought the labour flexibility to the waterfront that is required for us to be an efficient and fully competitive trading nation and that is essential for our farmers and our exporters to do the job right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that Australian ports are still 2 1/2 times more expensive than our New Zealand counterparts on average. Ordinary Australian consumers and exporters are paying more for their goods and getting less for their products as a result. This dispute has been temporarily settled with the help of the heavy hand of the ACTU, which cannot afford to have another bushfire burning just at the moment as it has its hands full arguing with the government over changes to enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the maritime unions were prepared to defy the Industrial Relations Commission and renege on agreements signed with constituent companies of the merged Australian stevedores confirms that the real issue was ignored during Labor's waterfront reform program. The suggestion by Senator Collins yesterday in response to my question that the opposition drew comfort from the disruption of the Australian waterfront is an unfortunate slur in that it has no basis of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that opposition senators `were clearly praying for an extension and continuation of the dock strike' is a poor attempt to suggest that they would be content to see major damage done to Australian exports and to Australia's trade reputation&mdash;which is obviously the very thing that opposition senators most want to prevent. To suggest that they felt `obvious disappointment that the industrial disputation would not be enlarged and would not continue' is not only fanciful but insulting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that Senator Collins heeded the opposition's warnings and dealt with the real reform needs of the waterfront. He should, however, be under no misapprehension that the opposition wants anything other than an end to all strikes. It will not endorse capitulation to the unions' bullying but requires rather that genuine reform be undertaken before such crises and strikes can recur. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More balance is required between the question of trade and human rights.</PARA>
<PARA>In diplomatic language this was taken as a signal to place the question of human rights second to that of trade negotiations. A very softly, softly approach to human rights in Asia was Mr Keating's prescription for the conduct of foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific region. With this attitude, Mr Keating would have been the worst advocate for Australia in its Olympic bid. It was precisely those Europeans who vigilantly protested against the Chinese violations of human rights, and the Tiananmen Square massacre in particular, who helped to turn the votes to Sydney's favour in the final count. The week before the vote on the Olympics, the United States Congress passed a resolution condemning China's human rights record and openly declared that for this reason China did not deserve to be awarded the Olympics in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it should be noted that the Asian nations supported the Chinese bid for the year 2000 Olympics only on the grounds of future trade benefits, totally disregarding China's record on human rights. We have to ask whether the Prime Minister has forgotten what type of regime China really is. Has he forgotten the basic fundament that China is a communist country? Has he no sense of history&mdash;the history of the blood and the torture that the communist regimes as a bloc inflicted upon the world? Proudly, the majority of European countries have not forgotten; they have learnt from history. The human rights and sovereignty questions of East Timor were totally ignored by the Prime Minister, and his comments regarding them are of serious concern so far as they signal to the Indonesian government that the human rights policies will go unchecked or mere tokenism will be in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of Timor clearly shows that, however small the island, its people, however few, are a people with a distinct national identity. The Portuguese first settled in Timor in 1520. The Spanish arrived in 1522. The Dutch took possession of the western portion of the island in 1613. The British took over from 1812 to 1815. The Dutch and the Portuguese fought for supremacy over the island's eastern half, and their respective interests were settled by treaties in 1860 and 1893. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the period of colonisation, the East Timorese retained a distinct nationality and culture.

History shows us that many national groups have waited for centuries to recapture their sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turkish ruled Greece for some 400 years. Afghanistan has seen more armies march through it than any other nation, and it has always retaken control of its own sovereignty. The national groups of central Asia and eastern and central Europe have also waited for decades, and in some cases centuries, for foreign occupiers to be forced to retreat. The Jewish people have waited 2,000 years to return to their homeland. In the case of East Timor, it may take years&mdash;it may take a century; it may take forever&mdash;to recapture its sovereignty and rights, but nothing will wipe away the truism that the East Timorese are not Indonesians and that their country does not belong to Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important, and more immediate an issue, is the question of human rights in East Timor today. This question has been dismissed by the Prime Minister. As it was reported, he rejected the Irish position of trying to re-open talks between Portugal and Indonesia to try to resolve the human rights problems in Timor. Mr Keating said that he did not know why Amnesty International was staging a silent protest to coincide with his visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, it would seem that Australia's newfound policy on human rights does not match Portugal's persistent attempt to defend the rights of the East Timorese. No-one should think that the Indonesian government does not exercise authoritarian control over the island of East Timor. At all levels of society it is running a shadow government. Unlike typical Western armies, the Indonesian army is deeply involved in social affairs. The staff structure corresponds broadly with the various tiers of the civilian administration and the police hierarchy, down to the village level, where there might be an NCO to monitor political and social developments and the work of the village headman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 November 1991 the human rights question was brought to the forefront of the world's attention with reports of the Dili massacre. The reports of the number of people killed ranged from the Indonesian claim of 50 to several hundred, according to foreign journalists. Such persecution was not unprecedented, but the advantage this event had was that it was filmed by foreign media and flashed around the world. It was the world that responded to condemn the Indonesian government for such an undue use of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Dili massacre was condemned by the UN. Now Australia is standing very much alone in its view of recognising the Indonesian annexation and with the tokenistic approach to human rights in East Timor. The world does otherwise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the committee's amendment, future arms sales to Indonesia will depend on six criteria. The first is whether civilians convicted in connection with the November 1991 East Timor incident have been treated in accordance with international standards of fairness. The second is whether the Indonesian government is taking steps to curb human rights violations by security forces, including bringing those responsible for the 1991 massacre to hand. The third is whether there has been a full public accounting of all the individuals declared missing after the massacre. The fourth is whether the international humanitarian and human rights organisations have been granted expanded access to East Timor. The fifth is whether the Indonesian government has started decreasing its military presence in East Timor. The sixth is whether Indonesia is cooperating with UN efforts to resolve disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following such pressure, the Indonesians have agreed to allow access by UN agencies and human rights groups to East Timor. The decision of the Indonesians was mediated by no less a personage than the UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, at a meeting between the foreign ministers of Portugal and Indonesia. In Jakarta a group of Swedish MPs has requested that the Indonesian government withdraw its troops from East Timor and has claimed that an arms embargo would be imposed on it until the status of the former Portuguese colony was determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now time for Australia to reassess its foreign policy regarding Timor, particularly in the light of the original justification by the Indonesian government, supported by the Australian government, that occupation was necessary to prevent a little Cuba developing. Perhaps in 1975, at the height of the Cold War, this had some reason. That was the year that the Vietnam War was lost. That was the year that US policy in Indochina collapsed and there was a fear that the red menace would continue its southwards march. Indonesia was seen as the bulwark against that threat. For such a wild act to be undertaken and supported by Australia at the time, it must have been believed that no chances could be taken with an independent East Timor. Now that the Cold War is over, when new alignments are being formed and peace is being given its best chance, such threats are no longer credible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is encouraging that the President of Indonesia, President Suharto, has recently acknowledged that East Timor was more trouble to Indonesia than it was worth. Perhaps this comment, however gratuitous it may be, is the first sign of a preparedness on the part of the Indonesians to accept the judgment of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one chapter in Australia's history which says that we owe it to the East Timorese for their contribution to the defence of Australia in World War II. They helped Australian soldiers in the defence of our country and for this East Timor was extensively damaged and tens of thousands of East Timorese were killed or died from starvation. I wonder how this history and present human rights violations in East Timor weigh on the Catholic conscience of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who was quoted in the media as saying, `We possess each an innate human dignity'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating claims that it is his Catholic conscience which prompts him to call for a republic and this equates with the defence of human dignity. I would have thought that a more serious and deeper analysis of his Catholic conscience would have led him to a stronger defence of human rights in countries such as East Timor. Now Australia stands alone in regard to the East Timor situation and what was justified by policy in the past is no longer as world history has ended and begun again. It is therefore crucial that Australia reassess its foreign policy towards East Timor. </PARA>

This Bill was part of a scheme designed to improve the safety and efficiency of road transport and to reduce the administrative costs associated with road transport operations in Australia.

We are in favour of standard mass limits, standard speeds, standard driver qualifications and standard vehicle inspection. The Western Australian minister at the ministerial council voted at various times against introducing the whole bill in Western Australia because of the standard charges on all vehicles around Australia, no matter how much or how little they work, where they work and whether they are on-road or off-road most of the time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales will not buy standard charges either because it reckons the standard charges are too low and that would then affect that state's road funding. Western Australia says that the charges are too high, and there are no exemptions for those vehicles that are important, which do not spend much time on the road but which have to be licensed because of third party insurance liabilities. An example is farm vehicles&mdash;ones used for seed, super and water carting. They hardly ever go on a road but now and again have to cross a road, or go to a standpipe, or a fertiliser shed to load up, or something like that. They probably operate out of the farmers' sheds for only six weeks of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another category of vehicle which Western Australia has had a lot of trouble convincing its authorities about is the fire truck which also comes under national standard vehicle charging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern with Western Australia's big mining industry is the drilling rigs. The trucks have to be licensed because now and again they have to go for an inspection, and now and again they have to go back to their bases for servicing, and some of those bases can be thousands of kilometres away. Most of the year, drilling rigs are in very isolated areas. Mining leases in Western Australia are way out and the rigs very seldom see a road&mdash;if they do, they are very backward roads. I am talking about the Gibson Desert, the Great Sandy Desert and areas around Kalgoorlie, Wiluna, Meekatharra, the harsh Pilbara and even into the Kimberley. I am not talking about the south-west of Western Australia where there are big built up areas, but about those remote areas. They are the problems we have in Western Australia and I would like to put them on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill, which went through parliament today, covered only the ACT and, I believe, a certain part of New South Wales around the Wollongong area, and the Federal government expects state parliaments around Australia to pass complementary legislation. As usual, the big stick of this federal government&mdash;of which you are part, Mr President&mdash;is that if the states do not toe the line, they will come in for cuts on road funding, as was the case with the black spot program. If Western Australia were to get any funding for the black spot program it had to introduce the .05 breathalyser count which it opposed for many years. The previous state government, the Labor Party government, did bring it in so it was able to get the black spot program funding. Incidentally, it was far less per capita than any other state in Australia considering that Western Australia has more kilometres of roads per capita than anywhere else in Australia, and probably in the world. The situation will be exactly the same in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you might have heard the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, say in question time the other day that he had no time for any states that did not spend untied road funding on roads. I share his dislike for that because I have always been an opponent of untied road funds. I have never believed that tied road funds should continue where the funds are tied to particular kilometres of roads, whether they be in a shire, whether they belong to the federal arterial road system or whether they belong to the road system. I do not believe in that system, which was in place for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in the system that road funding allocated in the name of road funding should be tied to roads&mdash;full stop. Whatever is allocated to roads should go into roads. Shires should not spend the money somewhere else and then run back to the state or federal government and say, `We have no money for roads. We need more'. So I agree with Senator Collins on that point. But he has to be brought to account for making such a statement when the One Nation package made a quite massive contribution to roads to try to build up some of the road systems in Australia before the last election. Mr President, you probably remember that well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind what Senator Collins said about not spending untied road funds on roads but road funds on roads, I have a letter here dated 9 July 1992 from the office of the Premier of Western Australia, who was Carmen Lawrence at the time, addressed to the Treasurer of Australia, Mr J. S. Dawkins MP complaining about $8 million of certain road funding. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear John</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 2 June 1992&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Treasurer's letter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">proposing that $8 million of road funding made available for Western Australia under the `One Nation' statement be reallocated to the Subiaco Oval redevelopment.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a government that believes that untied road funding should be spent on roads. The Treasurer wrote to the Premier of Western Australia on 2 June saying that the government had allocated $8 million&mdash;not Western Australia, Western Australia is still looking for the $8 million; it does not know where it went&mdash;to redevelop the Subiaco Oval. Once again, I believe that this had something to do with the election that was around the corner in 1993. The letter from Carmen Lawrence continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot agree to this proposal, as Western Australia has very substantial needs for road funding which are not being met from existing resources. Western Australia's share of national and arterial road funding from the Commonwealth has declined substantially in the last few years,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I have always said that in this chamber&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I understand that only 9% of national roads funding in the `One Nation' statement was allocated to Western Australia, which does not even represent a per capita share of funding for this State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the $8 million can be readily allocated to road projects in this State through consultation between the respective Commonwealth and State Transport Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is it. The Labor Premier of Western Australia at the time complained to the Treasurer about that missing $8 million. The next letter is dated 2 October 1992 from Pam Beggs, the former Minister for Transport in Western Australia, who was defeated in the last state election. I must say that Pam Beggs, although on the other side of politics, did try to do something for the roads of Western Australia. Her letter to Mr Brown, the Minister for Land Transport, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Brown</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your recent advice about the allocation of Land Transport funds gave a total of $161.2M to Western Australia in 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The total One Nation road package to Western Australia is $55.4M of which $2.5M was allocated in 1991/92 and $44.90M is included in the advised allocation of $161.2M in 1992/93. A further $8M is yet to be allocated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June the Federal Treasurer, Hon J S Dawkins, MP, wrote to the Premier proposing the $8M be set aside for non-road projects which related to the redevelopment of the Subiaco Football Oval.</PARA>
<PARA>It has been documented a second time. The letter goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July the Premier replied to the Federal Treasurer disagreeing with this proposal and advising there is a greater need for the funds to be provided on roadworks.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to describe that the $8 million would be better used between Wubin and Meekatharra in Western Australia. I totally agree with her sentiments that that is where the $8 million should have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we have a federal government which allocated quite a tidy sum at the time because it had to catch up with road funding. As I have said many times in this chamber, in real terms, since 1982 when the Fraser government went out of government, road funding went down and down and the whole system in Australia broke down badly. In that One Nation package the federal government attempted to bring the road system back up to standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So after road funding being neglected all this time, this $8 million was made available, but Mr Dawkins, the federal Treasurer, who is under siege at the present moment&mdash;I do not know how much longer he will be around as a Treasurer; I do not believe he will resign; I think Mr Keating might push him sideways&mdash;directed that that $8 million be taken off road funding that was so badly needed, and reallocated to develop Subiaco Oval for political purposes. If that $8 million had been spent on Subiaco Oval, which I disagree with but I am a great follower of football&mdash;the Eagles, East Fremantle and that sort of thing&mdash;I could find a way to excuse it, but that $8 million has disappeared altogether and we, from Western Australia, want it back again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is a letter from the present Minister for Transport in Western Australia, Eric Charlton. I cannot find his letter, but I have found his press release. I must say that Eric Charlton and I have not really seen eye to eye too much over the last 10 or 15 years in politics, but he is doing a very good job as Minister for Transport in Western Australia. Eric Charlton belongs to the National Party. His press release says that he has written to the federal Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, seeking a re-allocation of that $8 million, because the $8 million that the Treasurer asked to go to Subiaco Oval has not even gone to Subiaco Oval and Eric Charlton is looking to get it redirected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wherever Senator Collins is this evening I think he should hang his head in shame for the statement he made that he has very little time for states that do not spend untied road funding on roads. If he wants to lift his head up, he should ask Mr Dawkins to find the $8 million that he reallocated to Subiaco Oval but which was never spent, and he should give it to the Western Australian government so that it can spend it on the roads that badly need it to keep up our export income from primary production, minerals and all that sort of thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today in question time this chamber was treated to the greatest piece of evasion that this house has seen since the Khemlani letter affair nearly 20 years ago. I refer to the evasion we saw on the part of the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) and the infamous and notorious Labor Party lease, which the Commonwealth has entered into, which will deliver to the Labor Party $80 million over 15 years&mdash;$34 million more than the Department of Finance says is justifiable in commercial terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me start with an elementary proposition. When the government of the day is a Labor government and it takes a non-commercial lease of a building, which is not yet even built, for a non-commercial term of years, without any evidence at all of any attempt to negotiate a proper commercial arrangement&mdash;and takes this lease from its own party&mdash;the very least we could expect is that the punctilious observance of all relevant statutes, regulations and guidelines would be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as we heard today, the minister is not even prepared to say who made any of the relevant decisions. He is unwilling to say what act of parliament the minister at the time claimed to be acting under. He has not even produced a scrap of paper showing how in all of Canberra this was the only building on these exorbitant terms available to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, in meaningless phrases, he distorts every question asked by attempting to treat them as slurs upon the Public Service. He well knows that this is not the purpose of my questions. Their purpose is to sweep away the tissue of evasions, distortions and obstructions and ultimately to get to the truth about this unprecedented deal&mdash;and `deal' is the right word. This Labor Party is notorious for its deals&mdash;a deal here and a deal there&mdash;and when it uses the people's money to do its deals, this house is not prepared to be treated with contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister seems unwilling to face the very serious implications raised by the questions. It would be difficult to imagine a worse situation of conflict of interest. The situation appears graver day by day as it remains unexplained and festering. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hon. Alannah MacTiernan referred in her speech this evening in the Legislative Council to a student rally demonstrating against the voluntary student unionism legislation, which occurred in Western Australia a couple of weeks ago. In fact, those who were listening to the Senate during the matters of public interest debate earlier today will remember that I referred to it there. It was a robust meeting with a few hundred students in attendance and a number of Liberal Party politicians, including me, some Labor Party politicians and even a new Green politician from the state upper house. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sherry" NAMEID="ZW4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they are reproducing. It was a robust meeting and it was somewhat of a surprise to me. Firstly, it is a surprise that in 1993 one can get a group of students to actually demonstrate in favour of being compelled to join an association. I was not given the opportunity to speak at the rally. We were denied that opportunity because not only do these people not agree with freedom of association, they do not agree with freedom of speech. They call a public rally and then allow all the speakers to put the one side of the case. They did not allow the minister who was representing the government's position to speak; they gagged him. They certainly did not allow me or any other speaker to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such actions surprised me. Student activism in Australia is a proud tradition, as it is in most Western democracies. Many of us will remember, even though I was very young at the time, the rallies at Kent state university and universities across the globe rallying and protesting against involvement in the Vietnam war and specifically against the compulsion of the draft. So it is very surprising to see a few years later, in 1993, dedicated, principled students arguing in favour of being compelled to join an association or a union. We on the Liberal side of politics do not believe in compulsory student unionism or compulsory industrial unionism. We do not ever seek to distinguish between the two because an individual should be born free in Australia and should be free to choose whether or not to join any association whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hon. Alannah MacTiernan&mdash;who would probably describe herself as a Ms rather than a Miss or Mrs, and that is her right&mdash;decided to describe my behaviour at the rally. I will try to read out of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Western Australian Legislative Council to the extent that I can, because I have a terrible facsimile copy of it. She specifically accuses me of using physical threats to various female members of the student protest. She says that I continually threatened and harassed people who had obtained permission to conduct the rally on the steps of parliament house. She further says that I was continually trying to block them from having access to the microphone&mdash;access to the steps, she went on to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then my friend Ross Lightfoot, a member of the upper house there, interjected&mdash;out of order, Mr President, I am sure. The Hon. Alannah MacTiernan went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might add that his highly offensive sexist statements to the women who were in attendance were recorded and will be the subject of further inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>I shudder while waiting to see the outcome of their inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring this matter to the attention of the Senate because, firstly, I say to Alannah MacTiernan that to make those sorts of comments about my behaviour, with the protection of parliamentary privilege in the Legislative Council of Western Australia, is an act of cowardice. I remember earlier today in the Senate that Senator Robert Ray, the acting Leader of the Government here, challenged my good friend and colleague Senator Bishop. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly did, but that is not unusual for Senator Bolkus. In relation to what was said by the Hon. Alannah MacTiernan, member of the Legislative Council, I say to the Senate&mdash;and I can be challenged on this and will be&mdash;that I behaved quite normally and in a very fair and just manner at the rally to the extent that one can do so when surrounded by a few hundred people jostling and pushing you and generally yelling in your ear. I would ask her to go outside of the Legislative Council chamber, perhaps stand on the front steps of parliament house in Western Australia tomorrow&mdash;I will be travelling back to the west tomorrow morning, but I should be there around about noon&mdash;and I challenge her to say outside what she has said under the protection of parliamentary privilege in Western Australia. I consider her accusing me of using physical threats and other intimidatory tactics against female students as being not only quite defamatory of my integrity and standing in the community but also totally untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that on a number of occasions I had to ask the police who were present at this rally to come and protect some members of the university Liberal Club in Western Australia, because members of the protesting group were elbowing people in the mouth. As for statements as to my making threats to anyone, all I can say is that the only person I recollect making any sort of threat to was a bloke who stuck his elbow into the head of one of my young friends from the university Liberal Club. I actually went up to the bloke and said, `You do that again and I'll get this policeman over here to come and talk to you'. If that is a threat of anything, then so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was accused of making sexist statements to women at the meeting. One of them actually said that I had asked her for a date. I would like to put on the record once and for all what actually happened because it has been the subject of a couple of tiny articles in some august journals in Western Australia. One of the young ladies there was screaming at my friend and upper house colleague in Western Australia, the Hon. Ross Lightfoot, asking him his name. She was screaming, `What's your name, what's your name, what's your name?'. Ross Lightfoot refused to give her his name. Not many people in Western Australia do not know Ross Lightfoot on sight anyway, but Ross refused to give this girl his name. Ross Lightfoot said, `I don't need to give you my name'. This girl said, `My name is . . . '&mdash;whatever it was; I cannot remember now&mdash;`what's your name?'. She continued with this quite puerile line of questioning. I stepped in, in an attempt at humour and in an attempt to defuse the situation, and said, `Why do you want to know his name; are you going to ask him for a date?'. She misheard me in the ruckus and thought I had asked her for a date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the Senate that I have been happily married for about four years and have had a tremendous relationship with my wife, Brenda, for at least five years and have certainly not invited any girls out for a date in that period. If I were ever tempted to ask a girl out for a date, I can assure honourable senators that this particular girl would certainly not be the object of my inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not, because I am not attracted to those girls. There were certainly no sexist comments. To put this in context&mdash;I will try not to delay the Senate, even though I am sure it is a fascinating story for all those listening&mdash;after that incident this girl got particularly upset, even though she had the story totally wrong and then insisted that I apologise to the rally. I took this as an opportunity because right up to the last hour leading up to this I had been arguing that it was probably a fair thing for the minister to put the government's case. They said, `No, we've organised this rally, we're putting our point of view and that's all we're going to do'. In fact, they told us that we should not have been there because they got the licence for the rally and we were not even allowed to be there. In other words, they were having a public rally but one could not be a member of the public and be there and one certainly could not put another view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had generally been standing there negotiating as much as possible with the members of the student groups to say it would probably be better for the fairness of the rally if the alternative view was put. I certainly wanted to put the federal Liberal Party's point of view on the funding issue&mdash;the threat by the federal government to take away up to $5 million from the state of Western Australia if this legislation went through the parliament. I wanted to put on record our views on that and the fact that we will oppose the legislation based on that threat to Western Australia. I was not allowed to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when I was invited to speak to apologise to this girl to whom I was supposed to have made sexist remarks, I thought that would be a good opportunity to grab the microphone. As the people in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Newcastle Song</EMPHASIS> said, `Don't you ever let a chance go by'; I grabbed the microphone and said something to the effect that, `I apologise to all of you here'. Then the girl got upset and said, `You're not meant to be apologising to them; you're meant to be apologising to me'. So I turned to her and said, `I apologise to you as well because you have been brought here and the people who are organising this rally are not allowing you to hear the alternative side of the argument. I ask you all to allow the minister to be heard'. Having said that, they were forced to have a ballot as to whether the Minister for Industrial Relations, Graham Kierath, could actually speak. To the great credit of the student body and the protesters, they voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing him to speak. He grabbed the microphone shortly after that and some freedom of speech oriented member of the student body decided to pull the plug on the microphone and that was just about the end of the rally. That was all good fun and games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I think protests and rallies are all part of the democratic process. It is very important that we have a vigorous exchange of ideas and views at these meetings. At these rallies there is always danger of bodily contact and people jostling and so forth. As long as that is done in a good-natured way, no-one will come to any harm. Members of the radical Left and members of the NUS and so forth certainly did not behave in that way but I will not make the sorts of accusations against them that they have made against me because they achieve little in the overall debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do say to Alannah MacTiernan, who has gone into the Legislative Council of Western Australia tonight and made these defamatory points about my behaviour on that day, that if she is so convinced of what she says she should go outside onto the front steps of Parliament House tomorrow noon or tomorrow afternoon and repeat what she said in front of witnesses.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1610" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following answer addresses the honourable senator's question to the extent that the information is available to my portfolio. However, some parts of question concern matters which relate to the day to day management of forestry operations and the allocation and pricing of water resources which are the responsibility of State Governments and agencies. If the honourable senator requires additional information on matters which are a State responsibility, I suggest that it would be appropriate for him to approach the relevant State Ministers or agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Hydrological research in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia has shown that immediately following serious fire (such as the 1939 fires in Victoria) or intensive timber harvesting there is usually a significant increase in water production for a few years. After this initial increase, the resulting regeneration begins to require substantially more water than the original older forests, reducing the water production. Where this occurs there is a gradual reversion to the original patterns of water use as the forest ages. The extent of these changes varies greatly with forest type, soil type, topography and climate. It has been shown that stand thinning usually reduces the rate of water use by the regenerated forest, increasing its water production closer to the original levels. By way of example, the 1939 fires in Victoria caused the complete elimination of very large areas of old growth forest which were replaced with regrowth forests, some of which were of a single species, Mountain Ash. During the late 1960s and early 1970s Melbourne Water observed a substantial decline in water yield from catchments in regrowth Mountain Ash forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I understand that McLennan Magasanik Associates has made an assessment of the study "Evaluation of the Economic Values of Wood and Water for the Thomson Catchment" which was undertaken by Read, Sturgess and Associates for the Victorian Government. The assessment criticised aspects of the study's methodology (that timber and water prices were not valued on a consistent basis, that consideration of the social and regional employment consequences arising from a shift in timber milling operations was omitted and that additional sensitivity analyses involving changing the values of the economic variables simultaneously may have been appropriate). The assessment concluded "that considerable doubt attaches to changing the present (forest management) system, and it is by no means certain that a new rotation strategy would be an advance. Indeed there is a strong implication that the community in general would be worse off." I understand that a second report is to be prepared which uses different economic assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) There have been no long term or detailed studies on the hydrological impact of logging on the Errinundra Plateau. The unpublished study by Gell and Wilby attempts to extrapolate water use patterns from other forest environments into the Errinundra region, which serves as part of the catchment of the Delegate River. This provides a model that has not been tested. As much of the Errinundra Plateau is reserved from timber harvesting under conservation reserves, it would not appear that harvesting could have such a dramatic impact on stream flow as the question implies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Delegate River is of local significance in New South Wales for stock watering and recreational fishing, and in Victoria, through its input to the Snowy River, it contributes to the water source for an irrigation area of some 500 hectares in the Orbost region. The Delegate River is the principal source of municipal water for the town of Delegate and a partial source, through its input to the Snowy River, to the town of Orbost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) During periods of high redirection inland of Snowy River water, the Delegate River may provide a significant proportion of the downstream flow of the Snowy River into Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Timber harvesting can have an effect on water production from eucalypt forest by both increasing and decreasing the rate of stream flow. It is difficult to make generalisations about the implications of timber harvesting for the management of water resources because water production depends on local factors such as the climate, soil type, terrain and the nature of the vegetation (ie, rooting depth, species, age and leaf area). However, it is possible to apply catchment modelling techniques to predict the effect of forestry operations on water yield. Where reduction in flow rates could prejudice water rights, research has shown that management of the regenerated forest can minimise the impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Water resources used in the management of eucalypt forests are derived from rainfall. It is not possible to quantify the extent to which such water resources are used in the management of eucalypt forests for timber production due to the wide variation with forest type and environmental factors (such as climate, soil type, terrain and species) and the lack of research in many types of forest. As only 17% of the total area of Australia's native forests is available and suitable for timber production, the total impact is not likely to be great. Where there is significant local impact, management regimes can be modified to compensate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Under the National Forest Policy Statement, the States have adopted a number of principles as the basis for pricing and allocation arrangements for wood from public native forests including that prices will be market based, at least cover the full cost of efficient management attributable to wood production, include a fair return on capital, and provide an adequate return to the community from the use of a public resource. The Government supports the application of processes that allow transparency in the costs associated with the management of forests for timber production and for other community service obligations. The issue of payment by forest management agencies or industry for water allocation or management is one for State and Territory Governments to consider in the context of water pricing, allocation and management policies and strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) This question should be addressed to the relevant State rural and urban water agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) This question should be addressed to the relevant State rural and urban water agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Depending on the forest type, intensive harvesting of both old growth and regrowth could both lead to short-term increases and longer-term decreases in water production, with the regeneration of the forest. Old growth forests generally exhibit a patchwork of various ages. Conventional forestry operations, involving harvesting of coupes on a mosaic pattern, would result in the replacement of old growth forest with a patchwork of regrowth forest of varying ages. Therefore regrowth forest may not use any more water than the original old growth forest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) States and Territories which have signed the National Forest Policy Statement have, by their signing, committed themselves to the provisions of the Policy. The Commonwealth will work closely with the States and Territories in implementing the provisions of the National Forest Policy Statement. A joint subcommittee has been established drawn from members of the Standing Committees of the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council and the Australian Forestry Council which is responsible for regular monitoring </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and reporting to Governments on progress of the National Forest Policy Statement initiatives. Given the cooperative approach to implementing the Statement there is no need to write to the States as suggested.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) I refer the honourable senator to Senate Standing Order 73(1)(j), which provides that questions shall not ask for legal opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) One of the main areas of current research by the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology is the development and evaluation of predictive tools for water production in natural, disturbed and managed forests. The research is being carried out in collaboration with Melbourne Water, the Victorian Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the CSIRO Division of Water Resources. Other relevant research could be sponsored by the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation and the proposed Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation but decisions on the timing and conduct of commissioned research would be matters for the individual organisations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Islands Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The aid program follows a financial year funding arrangement. Expenditure on bilateral aid to Kiribati for the last three financial years has been:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1990/91&mdash;$2.4 million</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1991/92&mdash;$3.5 million</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1992/93&mdash;$4.3 million</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)The performance of three ocean outfalls was investigated in 1985 by Consulting Environmental Engineers of the NSW Region of the Department of Housing and Construction, and in June 1993 the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB) conducted a field appraisal of the South Tarawa Sanitation Project being developed by the Government of Kiribati (GOK). The appraisal concluded that it would not be possible to provide assistance until a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to encompass all health issues is developed in Kiribati and all inputs are co-ordinated under this approach to achieve an effective and sustainable improvement in health conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Tests show that the sewage disposal from the present sewerage system is not the most likely cause of the health problems on South Tarawa The present salt water flushing system empties into the sea through discharge outfalls via pumped reticulated sewerage mains. The zone of influence of the discharge on the bacteriological quality of the water at the reef edge extends less than 100 metres. Faecal coliform levels beyond 100m from the outfalls very seldom exceed 200 org/100 ml, the accepted safe standard established by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for recreation and bathing waters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems of health and pollution, however, are due more to population pressures and persistence with traditional methods of waste disposal, rather than to technical deficiencies in the sanitation systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Options for dealing with the remaining sewage problems on South Tarawa will only be considered as part of a program which addresses the overall critical health situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Extension of the present water borne system is one measure under consideration and options for treatment will be considered within that context. Sewage in the present system is not treated before discharge at the ocean outfalls and this has not caused significant problems (see response 3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The costs of upgrading and extending the present system have not been estimated at this stage since such work is only one aspect of a possible GOK integrated development program addressing the total health spectrum on South Tarawa This program is at a very early stage of consideration and does not yet have the full approval and support of the GOK.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The present system has been tested and found to be operating within acceptable coliform levels. The bulk of pollutants and other causes of the critical health situation are considered to arise from population pressures in non-sewered areas and not from the sewerage system as such. Should the GOK request the development of a program of Australian assistance to address the full range of health issues on South Tarawa, environmental studies will be conducted as mandatory aspects of AIDAB project development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) See response 6. AIDAB is not aware of data that allows an assessment of how and to what extent fish at the reef edge are polluted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Yes, but only in the broader context of the AIDAB appraisal (June 1993) which examined the full spectrum of health issues on South Tarawa; including water supply and sewerage systems, waste disposal in non-sewered areas, solid waste disposal, health education and population aspects. Alternative sewerage systems were considered within this general approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Not as yet, since the Government through AIDAB has not had a formal request from the GOK to undertake a program of activities which would address the full spectrum of health and population issues on South Tarawa</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Yes. Should GOK request assistance with the full spectrum of health issues, AIDAB will ensure that the sewerage system utilised will be the most appropriate, bearing in mind the cultural, physical, budgetary and political constraints to implementation. Composting toilets will be examined as part of such a comprehensive solution. Australian suppliers for AIDAB projects are invited through the normal free and open tendering process. When new equipment is provided it is normal practice to also provide technical assistance to facilitate operation and maintenance.</PARA>
