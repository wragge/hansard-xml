<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERSTATE GAS PIPELINES BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to implement statutory requirements for interstate gas pipeline operations, and thereby to facilitate the efficient and competitive development of the natural gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Natural gas has already gained widespread usage in the Australian community. It is an environmentally friendly fuel that is clean burning and produces lower greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Natural gas now accounts for around 17 percent of our primary energy demand, replacing more than 315,000 barrels of oil per day which we would otherwise have to import, worth $3.5 billion a year to our balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the period to 2005, domestic gas demand is forecast to grow at an average of around 2&mdash;3 per cent per annum. By 2005, gas could account for 20 per cent of our total energy needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that we are ready for this expansion and that the necessary strategies and legislative requirements are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Gas Strategy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background of prospective growth in gas demand the Government announced the National Gas Strategy in November 1991. Essentially the Strategy's objectives are to remove impediments to the efficient development and delivery of natural gas in response to the needs of the market. The Government firmly believes that removing impediments is essential to ensuring optimal development of the natural gas industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Gas Strategy includes four key elements:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the development of free and fair interstate trade in natural gas</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the development of an effective framework for interstate gas pipeline development</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reform of the Pipeline Authority, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">removal of volume approvals for LNG exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Pipeline Authority and the LNG exports approval system have already been reformed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent decision by the Governments of South Australia and Queensland to agree to increased interstate gas supply is a welcome step in the expansion of free and fair interstate gas trade. The bill I am introducing today sets out an effective framework for interstate gas pipeline development and represents a further major step in the implementation of the National Gas Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This framework for interstate gas pipelines will provide the basis for continued growth of national gas pipelines, generate competition in gas supply, and encourage an economically efficient industry where environmental impact is minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sale Of The Moomba-Sydney Pipeline</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's objective to have the regulatory system for interstate gas pipelines in place before the end of 1993 to assist the sale of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline. Mr President, the Government announced in the 1993-94 Budget that it would proceed with the sale of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most important outcomes of this bill will be that it provides a high degree of certainty for potential buyers of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline by setting out clearly the regulatory environment that will apply to this and future interstate gas pipelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contractual arrangements and undertakings relating to the future operation of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline will need to be revised to facilitate the sale, and this will be addressed in the sale process currently being conducted by the Department of Finance's Task Force on Asset Sales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, however, the statutory requirements set out in this bill will apply to all interstate pipelines, and will thus provide certainty for gas carriers and in particular, for gas consumers, who have expressed concern, mirrored on a number of occasions by such agencies as the Industries Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, about the possibility of pipeline monopoly abuse in the gas transmission sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulatory Framework For The Industry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill I have introduced incorporates four key elements:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">pipeline owners will be obliged to provide access to interstate pipelines on negotiated commercial terms and conditions, subject to pipeline capacity being available, with the Trade Practices Commission to arbitrate where required, when negotiations over access break down</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">pipeline owners will be required to maintain and provide separate accounting and separate management control of interstate gas transmission pipeline operations and be required to provide financial statements and other information on an annual basis and as requested, to the Prices Surveillance Authority to enable the PSA to monitor haulage charges</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">pipeline owners will be required to provide haulage charges with underlying terms and conditions, to be available on demand, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">any pricing behaviour that may breach  provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 will be matters for the Trade Practices Commission to investigate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, therefore, places statutory requirements on interstate gas pipeline operators that are intrusive only to the extent of providing to existing agencies the minimum of information necessary to protect the community against the possibility of monopoly abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of other countries have taken a different path on pipeline regulation. In the United States, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission acts as an industry specific regulator and in the United Kingdom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Office of Gas Supply stipulates terms and conditions specifically for gas trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will avoid the worst aspects of pipeline regulation in those countries. The approach implemented through this legislation will avoid a prescriptive approach to regulation of pipeline operations, at the same time providing mechanisms that ensure access to all interstate gas pipelines. This includes the capacity for the Trade Practices Commission to arbitrate unresolved access disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Free And Fair Interstate Gas Trade</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government sees the promotion of free and fair interstate gas trade as central to the efficient development of our natural gas resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The costs of not implementing free and fair trade in gas would be unacceptably high. The Australian Gas Association estimates these costs could be as high as $4 billion in net present value terms over the period to the year 2030.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent studies by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics confirm that there are substantial benefits in the order of $1.4 billion to be gained from interconnecting gas pipelines and extending gas networks. If gas trade were to be restricted, these benefits would be foregone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no justification for a situation where we all pay higher gas prices because of monopoly abuse or impediments to free and fair interstate gas trade. This bill will ensure that at least there will be no such impediments to access to interstate gas pipelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hilmer Report</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also facilitate a competition policy environment fully consistent with the objectives outlined in Professor Hilmer's recent report to the Government on national competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As stated recently by Mr Bill Scales, Chairman of the Industry Commission, in commenting on the Hilmer Report with reference to the coverage of the Trade Practices Act:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Additional measures are required to guarantee access to the services provided by true natural monopolies across Australia and to ensure an efficient level of pricing, in particular, to prevent monopoly pricing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He went on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A key issue in this regard is where vertically integrated owners of essential facilities . . . refuse access to competitors . . . either as a result of anti-competitive intent or because of a routine inability to agree a mutually satisfactory price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the main issues in relation to open access for interstate gas pipelines that this legislation addresses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Industry Commission Chairman put it:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The trick is to design a few good rules, but still give parties the maximum chance to negotiate mutually agreeable arrangements. This is the crux of a light handed regulatory approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach which the Government is taking in this legislation provides a framework which leaves gas carriers and gas users free to negotiate commercial terms, while at the same time providing for surveillance of haulage charges and arbitration of access disputes by the Trade Practices Commission with appeal to the Court only on matters of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach will assist the role of the Trade Practices Commission in relation to interstate gas trade. It is recognised that these roles of both the TPC and PSA may be replaced, in due course, by an umbrella body in the form of a general industry competition authority established following consideration of the Hilmer Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that any delay in proceeding with the statutory requirements for interstate pipeline operations as set out in this bill on the grounds that the Hilmer Report has to be considered, and an approach agreed with the States, cannot be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State/Industry Attitudes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the framework embodied in this legislation have been forwarded to State and Territory Governments, industry and gas users for comment. Major gas users, represented by the Electricity Supply Association of Australia Limited and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, strongly support establishment of transparent mechanisms and a regulatory framework to ensure recognition of the needs of all gas users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, gas industry associations, representing producers, distributors and transporters, have stated a clear preference to rely on the industry's voluntary Code of Practice for Access to Inter-State Natural Gas Transmission Pipelines as the basis for an industry self-regulatory system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the industry for developing a Code of Practice and believe that this will be of considerable benefit in encouraging sound and effective industry practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Code alone is not sufficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hilmer Report (page 246) comments on the Code, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"While the Code is an important contribution to the development of open access regimes, it does not provide any legally enforceable rights; it provides for a "right to negotiate" rather than a "right to access"; does not give guidance on pricing principles; and has no binding resolution mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Commission also considers the industry's Code to be not adequate to properly address the competition issues arising from interstate gas transmission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the Code in its present form is not supported by gas users. The Government is therefore of the view that the statutory requirements of this bill will act to complement the thrust of the industry's Code of Practice and bring the certainty that pipeline operators and users will require in future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some States have suggested that the legislation should await the implementation of the Hilmer Report. To await full implementation of the Government's response to Hilmer's findings would unnecessarily delay the implementation of a national legislated right of access to interstate pipelines where a clear public interest exists&mdash;concepts clearly endorsed by the Hilmer Report. It would also unnecessarily delay the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms and legislation that have been introduced today will facilitate a competition policy environment which is fully consistent with the objectives outlined in the Hilmer Report and will lay a sound framework for the efficient development and interstate delivery of Australia's gas reserves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (ALLIGATOR RIVERS REGION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of the Supervising Scientist, which includes the Alligator Rivers  Region Research Institute, was established by the Commonwealth in 1978, following the Fox Inquiry into uranium mining. The purpose of the office is to provide assurance to the Australian people that the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory is not being adversely affected by uranium mining. The Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute has now carried out research on the impact of mining on the environment in the Region for fifteen years and uranium mining operations have been underway for thirteen years. In this time much background data has been accumulated and the operation of the Ranger mine has been relatively trouble-free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the continuing public sensitivity to uranium mining issues, the need to ensure satisfactory rehabilitation of mine sites, the special significance of the Kakadu region and the Commonwealth's undertakings to the Northern Land Council and traditional Aboriginal owners, the Government believes that a continuing Commonwealth role is essential. Nonetheless, after fifteen years there is room for adjustment without jeopardising environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to streamline and refocus Commonwealth arrangements. The decision was made following discussions between senior officers from Commonwealth departments with the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Land Council and representatives of industry. I stress that following these changes there will be no diminution of environmental protection in the Region. This is of paramount importance to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation of mining operations will continue to be with the Northern Territory Government and working arrangements are to be improved following consultations with the Northern Territory Government. There will be no lessening of the Commonwealth's commitment to ensuring environment protection in the Region. The Office of the Supervising Scientist will continue to play a key role in supervising and assessing any impact of uranium mining activities in the Region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essence of the changes is:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">incorporation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (thereby reducing administrative duplication and achieving economies of scale),</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">refined mechanisms for consulting key stakeholders,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enabling the Minister to seek advice from the Supervising Scientist on environmental matters outside the Alligator Rivers Region,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute to undertake research on matters outside the Region on a commercial basis, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">establishment of an independent review of the research now needed to meet the Commonwealth's environment protection objectives in the Region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An independent consultancy to review the nature and priorities for research needed at this stage of uranium mining operations to provide a basis for maintaining a satisfactory level of environmental protection in the Region is being arranged. In recognition of the importance of continued protection of the environment to the Traditional Owners in the Alligator Rivers Region, the views of the Northern Land Council, as well as of other key stakeholders, will be taken into account by the independent review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implementation of some of these changes requires amendment of the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act and this is the purpose of the bill before you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been working for some time towards strengthening its environmental management capabilities by consolidating various related organisational components. With this in mind, in 1992 the Supervising Scientist's head office was moved from Sydney to be co-located with the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency in Canberra. Complete incorporation of the office into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency will lead to direct and indirect savings in the order of $650 000 per annum from 1994-95 onwards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the integration of the office into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, there will be no further need for the Supervising Scientist to have the powers of a Departmental Secretary under the Public Service Act 1922 and the relevant section is repealed by this bill. The Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region will continue to be a statutory position with similar duties, powers and functions, but will now be an office in the Commonwealth Public Service and subject to the provisions of the Public Service Act in relation to remuneration and other conditions of service. The Supervising Scientist will continue to manage the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are considerable gains to be had by setting the operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist in a broader context and making the expertise of the organisation more available to others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly it is proposed to amend the Act to enable the Minister to draw on the considerable knowledge in the Office of the Supervising Scientist to advise the Government on environmental matters outside the Alligator Rivers Region. I stress that it is not the purpose of this proposal to promote uranium mining development, either in Australia or overseas, but to enhance the quality and scope of specialist environmental advice available to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute will continue to provide the research basis in relation to the impacts of uranium mining in the Region, it will also be empowered to undertake scientific research on environmental matters outside the Region on a fee-for-service basis. By undertaking contract research, the Institute could earn up to 30 per cent of the Commonwealth contribution to its research program. Thus the Institute will be able to contribute more efficiently to the national research effort by making its considerable expertise available to others, while at the same time strengthening its own capacity for research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also establish improved arrangements for consulting with key stakeholders and scientific and technical experts. The Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region will be replaced by two linked committees, the Consultative Committee and the Technical Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Consultative Committee will comprise the Minister's appointees drawn from key stakeholders, including Aboriginal and environment groups and an independent chair. It will provide a formal forum for policy consultation on matters relating to the effects on the environment in the Alligator Rivers Region of uranium mining in the Region, as well as commenting on, but not changing, recommendations to the Minister from the Technical Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Technical Committee will advise the Minister on the continuing nature and extent of research needed as a basis for maintaining a satisfactory level of protection in the Region and on the most appropriate organisations (including the Research Institute) to carry out the recommended research. The Technical Committee will have expert representation from the Research Institute, Northern Territory authorities, the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, the Northern Land Council and the mining companies. The chairperson and members will be selected by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes these new consultative arrangements will more effectively meet the needs of the Commonwealth and the key stakeholders, by more specifically focusing on policy and technical aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the bill before you will provide for a more up-to-date, focused and integrated approach to protecting the environment of the Alligator Rivers Region. It will also achieve cost savings in delivering this important service to the people of the Region, the mining industry and all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is a portfolio bill which amends eight acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Act 1903 is to be amended to change the title of the "Chairman" of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal, adopting the gender neutral title "President".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 will enable the Australian Industrial Registry to act as registry for state industrial bodies, including state industrial relations tribunals, industrial courts and workers' compensation tribunals.  This measure complements steps which have already been taken in South Australia to co-locate the state and federal industrial registries. The proposed amendments will enable integration of the state and federal industrial registries to take place in any state where the federal minister and the appropriate state authority agree. In other words, the Commonwealth will not be able to impose integration on any state that does not want it. Negotiations are already underway with the South Australian government that may see the Australian Industrial Registry assuming state registry functions in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, amendments of the Industrial Relations Act are proposed to enable the rules of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to prescribe the period within which an objection to the variation of an award that is a common rule must be lodged. At present no such period is prescribed, and this can cause difficulties in relation to the enforcement of common rule awards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments of the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 will give the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of Representatives the same powers under that act as are currently held by the public service commissioner. This means that the presiding officers will have the power, in specified circumstances, to declare the position held by a female officer who is on maternity leave to be vacant, with the consequence that the officer concerned becomes an unattached officer. The amendments also give the heads of the five parliamentary departments certain powers and functions in relation to the administration of maternity leave in their departments. To date these powers have been exercised under delegation. The amendments are consistent with the intention that the administrative arrangements governing the parliamentary departments be independent of the wider Australian public service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor amendments are made to the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 which contribute to the government's policy of ensuring adequate occupational health and safety protection for the Commonwealth's own employees. In particular the amendments:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.clarify the application of the act to employees who do not work in offices or factories;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.strengthen the reporting requirements in relation to accidents and dangerous occurrences; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.broaden the regulation making powers under the act to allow the Commonwealth to meet its commitment to achieve a national, uniform system of occupational health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments are proposed to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, to provide procedures for the removal of discriminatory provisions from determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal. The amendments will enable the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to refer discriminatory provisions to the Remuneration Tribunal. The tribunal will be required to conduct a hearing into the matter and, if it is satisfied that a provision is discriminatory, to take action to remove the discrimination. The process will be initiated by complaints to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner will have a discretion not to act upon complaints which, in the opinion of the commissioner, are frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Remuneration Tribunal Act is to be amended to require the tribunal, when determining the remuneration of executives of government business enterprises, to take into account the superannuation entitlements of those executives. The Remuneration Tribunal Act is also to be amended to change the title of the "chairman" of the Remuneration Tribunal, adopting the gender neutral title "president".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 will assist Comcare and licensed authorities to recover certain overpayments which may occur when an employee who is receiving workers' compensation benefits retires and becomes entitled to superannuation benefits. The proposed amendment introduces a scheme that will enable the overpayment to be recovered from the superannuation fund concerned, rather than from the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme will only operate if Comcare or the relevant licensed authority seeks to recover an overpayment before the retired employee receives his or her first superannuation benefit payment. Other safeguards have been designed to minimise the scheme's impact on superannuation fund administrators and individual employees. In particular, I note that a determination that an amount of compensation has been overpaid and is to be recovered under the proposed scheme will be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act 1946 will enable regulations to be made prescribing fees to be charged, on a cost-recovery basis, for certain functions which the Department of Industrial Relations performs in support of the local and central trades committees established by the act.  Since 1989 the department has been charging fees, on a partial cost-recovery basis, to applicants for trade skills assessment under the act. The fees were imposed administratively and the department was recently advised that there is no statutory authority for them. The collection of fees ceased pending the coming into effect of the necessary legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. However, as mentioned in the explanatory memorandum, it is expected that the amendments of the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act will result in the payment to the Department of Industrial Relations of fees totalling approximately $180,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (SEA DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to the protection of the Australian marine environment and has pursued the implementation of this policy on both the national and international fronts by participating in consultations aimed at producing agreed measures for the prevention and control of marine pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 so as to enable Australia to ratify the Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution of the South Pacific Region by Dumping, which is commonly referred to as the SPREP Dumping Protocol. This protocol is one of two protocols to the Convention for the Protection of the Natural Resources and Environment of the South Pacific Region, otherwise known as the SPREP Convention. Australia has already ratified the other Protocol concerning Co-operation in Combating Pollution Emergencies in the South Pacific Region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SPREP Convention  was ratified by Australia on 19 July 1989. It is a comprehensive, umbrella agreement for the protection, management and development of the marine and coastal environment of the South Pacific Region. It lists the sources of pollution which require control, such as pollution from ships, dumping, land-based sources, atmospheric discharges, among many others. The SPREP Dumping Protocol recognises the danger posed to the marine environment by pollution caused by the dumping of waste or other matter at sea, and places obligations on parties to prevent, reduce and control pollution in the Protocol Area by dumping.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SPREP Dumping Protocol is essentially a regional agreement consistent with the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, also known as the London Convention 1972. Australia fulfils its international obligations under the London Convention 1972 through the Sea Dumping Act, which came into effect on 6 March 1984. As a great majority of the obligations under the SPREP Dumping Protocol are met by the provisions of the Sea Dumping Act, it is expedient that Australia join its Pacific Island neighbours in this regional agreement by amending the Sea Dumping Act. Also, the major overlap with the provisions of the existing Act means that the financial implications of ratifying the SPREP Dumping Protocol will be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there are some aspects of the SPREP Dumping Protocol which impose slightly different requirements from arrangements currently in place under the Sea Dumping Act. The major difference is that the SPREP Dumping Protocol covers a geographical area which is different from the definition of "Australian waters" in the Sea Dumping Act. However, there is no legal reason why Australia cannot choose to apply the additional requirements of the SPREP Dumping Protocol in waters to which the Sea Dumping Act applies. The practical effect of applying the SPREP Dumping Protocol to all Australian waters and the continental shelf is that it will be an offence to dump organophosphorous compounds in the Indian and Southern Oceans as well as the SPREP Convention area. Consequently, as Tasmania currently has the rollback provisions under section 9 of the Sea Dumping Act which allows it to administer the loading and dumping of wastes or other matter in its coastal waters, the Tasmanian Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1987  will need to be amended within 12 months to reflect the additional requirement of the SPREP Dumping Protocol. The necessary action is underway.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sale of CSL Limited is an important part of the Government's micro-economic reform program. The decision to sell CSL by way of an initial public offering of shares is consistent with this Government's desire for Australia's pharmaceutical manufacturing base to grow stronger, with linkages to international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For CSL to compete effectively in the international market place and to achieve its full growth potential, it requires greater financial and management flexibility to secure capital and pursue its internationalisation goals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public float of CSL will enable it to achieve this potential and will release the Commonwealth from its incongruous position of being owner, as well as customer and regulator of the company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSL was established by the Australian Government in 1916 to help meet the pharmaceutical needs of an isolated nation then at war. Following the implementation in 1989 of a reform package which corporatised its operations, CSL is now an unlisted government-owned public company with assets of $238 million and sales for last year exceeding $160 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSL is an independent developer, manufacturer and marketer of ethical healthcare products. Its core expertise is in human and veterinary pharmaceutical and diagnostic products of biological origin, notably vaccines and blood plasma products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSL'S principle products include influenza and infant triple antigen vaccines, antivenoms and a variety of plasma-derived products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant levels of resources have been directed to research, development and commercialisation of core products. More than $18 million has been invested by CSL in research and development during the past year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company is as export oriented as it is research based. It is actively internationalising its pharmaceutical, veterinary, diagnostic and plasma products business. Presently, 10% of its revenues come from export sales and there are plans for further expansion in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based at its 12 hectare site at Parkville, Victoria, CSL employs 1,200 people and has sales and distribution branches in each mainland state. In addition, the construction of a highly advanced blood plasma fractionation plant is currently nearing completion at Broadmeadows in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sale Strategy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government took a decision as part of the 1992-93 Federal Budget to sell all of its shares in CSL. After a detailed "scoping study" of the various sale options open to it, the Government announced in November 1992 that the sale would proceed on the basis of an initial public offering of the whole of the Government's 100% shareholding. The flotation will occur in the second half of this financial year, depending upon market conditions and sale preparations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Interest Provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to float CSL was predicated on the company remaining independent, under Australian control, and continuing its key role in providing blood products to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill addresses these key issues by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">limiting the voting rights of significant foreign shareholders in regard to appointment, replacement and removal of company directors;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">requiring that CSL's head office and principal fractionation activities be located in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">requiring that CSL remain incorporated in Australia and CSL's chairman and two thirds of the board be Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These arrangements will be complemented by an allocation of shares in CSL at point of sale as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a limit of 5% on all individual shareholdings, domestic or foreign;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an aggregate limit of 15-20% on foreign shareholdings; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">preference for individuals and institutions over corporate shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This share allocation strategy aims to achieve a broad spread of shareholdings at the time of float which, combined with market based incentives, should ensure an independent CSL into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continued supply of plasma products post sale will be covered by a long term contract between CSL and the Commonwealth. Supply of these products is a key national interest issue. Accordingly, provisions have been included in the Sale Bill to enable the Commonwealth, through the Minister for Health, to have direct access to the Federal Court in the event of a breach of the contract, and for the court to make orders to ensure continued performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a prohibition on CSL disposing of, encumbering or granting any interest in the plasma products facility at Broadmeadows without the Commonwealth's consent. The plasma products supply contract will also restrict CSL'S ability to dispose of plant and equipment which is necessary to enable them to fulfil their contractual obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions represent the best available protection of the national interest, consistent with the sale of CSL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill now before the house contains the legislative changes that need to be made to enable the float of CSL to be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the bill is concerned with the removal of CSL from the ambit of Commonwealth legislation so that, post-sale, CSL will be the same as any other Australian pharmaceutical or healthcare company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff Entitlements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to the protection of all CSL employees' rights which accrue during the period of Government ownership, especially in cases where these rights accrue as a result of Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, the bill provides for a number of "savings" provisions in respect of a variety of acts, such as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. These provisions will ensure, in particular, that employees of CSL do not lose the benefits that they will have accrued prior to sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rights under the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act will apply for 12 months post sale. In general, other rights not conferred by Commonwealth legislation will not be affected by the sale as the Government is selling its shares in CSL and the CSL Award will continue post sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation contains transitional arrangements to provide certainty that CSL is freed from all legislative constraints which apply generally to Commonwealth Business Enterprises and to clarify the position in relation to rights and obligations which arise prior to the sale day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of CSL could leave the purchasers of CSL shares liable for certain State and Territory taxes and fees. To avoid this liability, to reduce potential sale process complications and to increase the return to taxpayers, the sale is to be exempted from State and Territory taxes and fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill puts in place a sound legislative framework to enable the public offering of the Commonwealth's shareholding in CSL to proceed. It provides the Commonwealth with security over CSL'S role in fractionation while freeing CSL from obligations to the Commonwealth other than those of any publicly listed company.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Aviation Fuel Revenues (Special Appropriation) Act 1988. Currently the Act provides for appropriation to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of duty on aviation gasoline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendment is to enable duty on aviation turbine fuel (aviation kerosene) to also be appropriated to the CAA as part of the aviation safety regulation cost recovery regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government Decision</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1992 Budget it was announced that the cost of aviation safety standard setting and surveillance would be jointly met by the Government and the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will meet 50 per cent of the costs up to a limit of $22.8 million (in real terms).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cost recovery of the industry's portion of these costs is being phased in over two years from 1993/94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cost recovery arrangements for 1993/94 involve a slight increase in duty on both aviation gasoline and aviation turbine fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The required increase, which applies from 1 September 1993 is 0.264 cents per litre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because fuel used by Australian airlines on international services is exempt from duty, the CAA will introduce a fee for safety regulation in relation to these international operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In implementing these cost recovery arrangements for 1993/94, the Government has carefully noted the views expressed by the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Post 1993/94 Arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CAA is developing a long term funding strategy for aviation safety regulation to apply from 1994/95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of the strategy will involve an examination of the economic ,and safety implications and impacts of possible mixes of charges and taxes on the aviation industry. The process will also involve extensive consultation with the aviation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry contribution to aviation safety standard setting and surveillance for 1993/94 will reduce Government outlays by $4.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Users of aviation gasoline recently benefited from a three cent per litre reduction in duty and the CAA is currently exploring the prospect for a further reduction following the introduction of new airspace management arrangements in November this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the very low rate of duty, therefore, the 1993/94 arrangements are not expected to result in any significant adverse financial impact on any particular aviation industry sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The post 1993/94 funding arrangements will take into account the effects on the industry of any new funding strategies.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to increase the Departure Tax was taken at the same time as the Government decided to increase funding for tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced in the Budget, an additional $80 million has been allocated to boost the development of new tourism products and for tourism promotion over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This funding includes an extra $8 million in 1993/94 and $10 million per annum to 1996/97 for overseas market development by the Australian Tourist Commission which will help ensure strong growth in inbound tourism and add to job creation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in Departure Tax will help offset this additional tourist promotion expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At $25, Australia's Departure Tax will be around the same level as charges imposed on international travellers by authorities in the United States and Fiji and is below those levied in Japan, Hong Kong, Canada and in a number of European countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Greece and Germany.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in Departure Tax is expected to increase revenue by some $11 million in 1993/94, $28 million in 1994/95, $30 million in 1995/96 and $32 million in 1996/97.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I have no opposition to the extension of the number of members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I wish to draw to the attention of my colleagues here today an aspect of the membership of that committee. Neither of the two parties that consider themselves the major parties have any women representatives on that committee. While there are two women members of the committee, Senator Lees of the Australian Democrats and me, the imbalance has just increased&mdash;unless the major parties take advantage of this opportunity to make sure that they have women represented amongst the  contingents they provide from their parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a particular reason why this matter may be extremely useful to the committee: the committee has received a reference from the Senate regarding women, elections and parliament, with particular reference to, firstly, the reasons for the gender imbalance in the Australian parliament, secondly, strategies for increasing the number and effectiveness of women in political and electoral processes, and, thirdly, the effect of parliamentary procedures and practices on women's aspirations to and participation in the Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the argument may be extended that to have more than two women out of 12 may not reflect the representation of women in parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a very good gender balance. We are trying to compensate for the over-representation of the male gender in this parliament. But the Greens, as a rule, take as an indication of the health of their organisation that 50 per cent of their candidates are men and 50 per cent are women. That is not contrived. It happens because we have a very healthy organisation which does reflect the broader community. That is what I wish to see in the parliament and on this committee as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that Senator Kernot is in the chamber. I think it is time we brought this matter to a head. I have been trying to come to a conclusion with the Australian Democrats on the situation for quite some time regarding some support for this motion. This motion relates entirely to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and its accountability. I have been branded as a racist by some people over this motion, in a situation where they think that I am attacking ATSIC and the Aboriginal people, and attacking the funding that goes to them. I have never ever done anything along these lines. I have simply asked for accountability. I really started with the Auditor-General's report. Ever since, I have had messages of support from right around Australia, which I have referred to before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to my dealings with the Democrats, Senator Kernot will know that I had agreed, at her request, to move an amendment, and that amendment was to restrict this inquiry to Western Australia. I had the amendment printed; I did not have it circulated; the amendment was at their request. I had promise of support on a Thursday about four weeks ago, if I remember rightly. By the next Tuesday that support was not quite so strong. Then it was suggested to me that we refer the matter to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs which I believe may have been a way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there is no way&mdash;or no-one has told me if there is a way&mdash;of referring any matter from this Senate down to the House of Representatives. I spoke to the chairman or one of the members of that committee, whose name escapes me. He said he would be willing to take it on but, unfortunately, the minister there sets the terms of reference. I believe this is an important issue that should be addressed on its own, not buried with something else. It is about the accountability, and accountability alone, of ATSIC; also the Aboriginal Legal Service. So I said I was happy to keep this reference in Western Australia: the Aboriginal Legal Service and ATSIC funded bodies&mdash;especially ATSIC funded bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, there is a big article on what has happened in Victoria with an ATSIC related body. There has been another big blow-up which has got out of hand. That body should have gone into liquidation some time ago, but it has not done so. An administrator has been in there for a couple of years trying to improve the situation, but it has not worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another ATSIC related corporation in Wyndham in Western Australia into which ATSIC poured a vast amount of money but still could not keep it afloat. If ATSIC wanted to pour money especially into that one in Wyndham, that was its decision. I am concerned about accountability. The money was poured in and the corporation was kept afloat, so the local traders presumed that its standing was on a pretty even keel. Unfortunately, because it was kept going by ATSIC, more and more credit was given to it by the local traders, who presumed they were on safe ground. To my knowledge, the corporation has not been put into liquidation officially, but the traders have been left high and dry for whatever they had supplied over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a normal situation when a corporation gets into difficulties, there are very stringent laws. A corporation cannot trade after it becomes technically insolvent. In other words, if it owes more than it is worth, even though it is trading pretty well at that stage, it cannot continue trading. In this case in Wyndham in Western Australia, to my knowledge, the corporation has kept trading far beyond the time it ceased to be viable. So it has bought more and more people in. That is the situation, and it is time we got to the bottom of it. It is not only happening there; it is also happening in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of my concern is the Aboriginal Legal Service, especially in Western Australia. Some people on our side of politics in Western Australia have been trying for the past two years to get an inquiry into the ALS. Mr Eric Charlton, the Western Australian transport minister, who is a member of National Party of Australia, has been trying to get an inquiry for two or three years, but one cannot find out what is going on with the ALS money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ALS money is allocated to defend Aboriginals in court. That is what it is there for. It is not there for anything else. I know, and others from Western Australia will know, that this year, not very long ago, the ALS funded a protest march. I wonder whether anyone in this chamber can tell me that that is a legitimate way in which to spend ALS funds. If so, I would ask them to please speak up. It is time we got to the bottom of that sort of thing. It has been going on all the time, and we have been spending around $1.3 billion on ATSIC's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have visited the communities around Western Australia and I have visited a few in the south of the Northern Territory. I have noticed that health, housing and education standards are going down more and more. Some communities, such as Warburton in Western Australia, are doing well. I visited Warburton once on the same day as Senator Beahan. That community has been going reasonably well because it had been hauled out of a very bad situation by a manager who was appointed 10 years ago. He is very dedicated and he is doing a very good job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turkey Creek community in Western Australia is in the same situation, and I could probably name two or three others. There is quite a good one that I have visited in the Northern Territory at Docker River. That is run very well. But then there are the others, especially on the Strelley leases in Western Australia, where money has been wasted. On the Strelley leases, in the last two years $1.7 million has been paid in, yet the place has been abandoned and buildings have been wrecked and left to rack and ruin. I am looking at accountability to see what is going on in this situation. That is why I had asked the Democrats and the Green senators from Western Australia for support, but they refused flatly to support me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that if, in this place and other places, one questions or asks for accountability on anything to do with Aboriginals, one is branded as a racist and has to back off. They are untouchables. Yet, if I moved to have an inquiry into the accountability of any other ethnic branch in Australia when the Auditor-General had named it as needing an inquiry into its accountability, I would probably get total support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At estimates we had the Auditor-General in front of us&mdash;only the second time, I think, that an auditor-general or his representative had appeared in front of an estimates committee. His representative said that the greatest condemnation that the Auditor-General can make of a department is to make a report. As to the rest, he said that it is up to parliament to do what it chooses if it wants accountability. Accountability is demanded in this parliament of all other departments and I cannot see why we should back off from asking it of this body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, I am about accountability and nothing else. We should get away from the silly notion that, because it is about Aborigines, no-one is allowed to say anything. I believe it is time that the honourable senators who are in this parliament from all over Australia supposedly to keep people honest told Australia exactly how they stand in this situation. It is certainly time they did that. As I said, I had support from the Democrats in the beginning, when I agreed that, in the short time there was, this would be restricted to Western Australia. We were not able to reach the matter by 10.30 on the Thursday night; after the weekend, by the next Tuesday, their approach was lukewarm. It has been sidelined to go down to the House of Representatives committee. I have looked into that, in depth, and I cannot see that an inquiry like that would be sufficient. Would that committee have the time to do it or, if it did, get to the bottom of things?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion was supported by a lot of speakers on this side of the chamber. I had invited the Democrats to speak on it and the Greens, for that matter, and anyone on the side of the government who wanted to speak on the situation of accountability, but to date they have preferred to take a backward step. The Democrats are not yet beyond speaking. I am sure that, if they wished to seek leave to speak on the matter, leave would not be denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I have had the total support of my party on this motion. I have had the total support of my side of politics in Western Australia. I have had support from Queensland, where the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) comes from. I have had support from New South Wales. I cannot remember whether I have been contacted by anyone from Victoria. Someone from South Australia definitely contacted me and, of course, we in Western Australia are the ones screaming out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also had it put to me that starting an inquiry now will interfere with the ATSIC elections coming up in December, and that I might have even worked with people towards that situation. That is something that I definitely did not do. I have had enough of seeing non-accountability for this budget and that is why I have progressed down this path. I reiterate that a lot of this $1.3 billion is being wasted. Everywhere I go I see declining health. Someone told me that he had been to a community where four young children had died because of the lack of health services, and that the doctors and nurses were overworked. Housing is going backwards. Also, $12 million of the budget was returned to the Commonwealth because it was unused. This is totally out of order. It is time that this matter was put to rest. I leave it at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I need to clarify a few of the things that Senator Panizza has said. It is true that this matter has been the subject of constant negotiation. The Australian Democrats have no desire to shield any statutory authority from public scrutiny and we have no desire to treat ATSIC any differently from any other organisation. However, I think there are a couple of other facts that we ought to take into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I persuaded Senator Panizza to confine the terms of reference to Western Australia, and to give specific focus to the Auditor-General's report, that was in the spirit of improving the scope of the inquiry and it was acceptable to Senator Panizza and to the Democrats. Subsequent to that, I discovered that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is required to look at all Auditor-General reports that deal with anything relating to Aboriginal affairs. Therefore, the matter that Senator Panizza has brought up as a term of reference is already to be investigated by the House of Representatives standing committee. I am not sure that insisting that finance and public administration persist with this inquiry is not duplicating something that already exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing I did was speak to the chair of that committee, Mr Garrie Gibson, and ask him whether there was any way in which he could take over the thrust of the terms of reference. He agreed that his committee would look at the details. He cannot take over the terms of reference word for word and the Senate cannot require that the House of Representatives committee do so. Because his committee is about to visit Western Australia, and because there are coalition members on that committee who can pursue Senator Panizza's questions, it seemed to me that we were being asked to agree to the expensive duplication of an inquiry. I do not think we should do that. My last suggestion to Senator Panizza was that we simply put down notice of a motion&mdash;drawing attention to his terms of reference&mdash;and request that the House of Representatives committee consider the issues raised in that notice of motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not true to say that the FPA is urging us to refer this matter to it. That leads us back to these questions. Can it be done? Is it being done? Does it have to be done by this Senate committee? It does not have to be done by this Senate committee. We can achieve the same purpose by letting the House of Representatives standing committee continue with its inquiry and pursue this matter there. In fact, there are Western Australian coalition members on that committee who will be in a perfect position to raise the questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not seeking to deny an inquiry but there is just one other thing. Senator Panizza has had a lot of correspondence; we all have. But we also have to be realistic enough to know that we are in the first stages of an ATSIC election campaign. The election will be held in December. I do not think it is right for us to let any individuals seek to use the processes of the Senate to assist them as candidates in an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say to Senator Panizza that we cannot agree to duplicate expensive inquiry processes when we believe that the matter can be handled, and can be handled thoroughly, by an existing committee in the other place. That is not to give up our jurisdiction; it is simply to say that we should be sensible about these things. If Senator Panizza insists on pressing on at this moment, I regret that because we have not found a more cooperative resolution we will be forced to vote against it. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the Treasurer's statement entitled Strengthening Super Security&mdash;New Prudential Arrangements for Superannuation, seven Bills were introduced into Parliament on 27 May 1993. These were designed to strengthen substantially the framework of prudential supervision for the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the terms of reference for the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was to report on this legislation and related matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental objective of these Bills is to introduce a comprehensive regulatory regime for the superannuation industry. Such a regime is required for three main reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. to ensure that the tax concessions provided for superannuation are used for the purpose they were granted, that is, genuine retirement incomes purposes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. to ensure the stability of the financial system in so far as it relates to superannuation savings; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. to increase public confidence and security in the superannuation industry and, therefore, promote increased superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Industry Supervision, (SIS) Bills as they are known, represent the most detailed and far reaching attempt in the history of superannuation in Australia to impose a common regulatory framework on the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of such an undertaking is highlighted by the sheer size and complexity of the superannuation industry. Currently, superannuation savings in Australia amount to $169 billion, which is equivalent to about one third of Australia's gross domestic product (GDP), and are growing at a rate which exceeds even rapid economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for a comprehensive regulatory framework is further evidenced by the failure of a number of collective investment schemes, including a small number with a superannuation focus, in the past five years and problems in superannuation regulation in overseas countries which also have trustee administration of pension funds. These themes have been addressed repeatedly by the Select Committee on Superannuation during its two year inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SIS Bills are designed to provide the Government with a more proactive and flexible role in the prudential supervision and control of superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Report&mdash;overview</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the seven Bills introduced on 27 May 1993, the Committee has recommended that four be passed without amendment, namely:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the Occupational Superannuation Standards Bill 1993 (OSSA);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill 1993;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1993; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that amendments be made to the following Bills:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (SIS) Bill 1993;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the Superannuation Industry (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) (SIS) Bill 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SIS Bill is the central plank of the new policy platform. It contains provisions which will radically alter the way that superannuation funds operate. Given the magnitude of the proposed change it was not surprising that the Committee received a large number of submissions, 97 in all, and agreed to take evidence from more than 60 witnesses representing the interests of superannuation providers, regulators and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the SIS regime all superannuation savings will come under the control and supervision of the prime regulator, the ISC.  All superannuation funds will be managed by a single entity, the trustee body. The trustee body is required to make an irrevocable election to be regulated under the aegis of either the corporations or the pensions powers of the Constitution. All public offer superannuation funds, formerly regulated by the ASC, will also move to single entity status. Previously they were managed under a dual entity arrangement whereby control was shared by the trustee and the funds manager.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking note of the enormity of change in the public offer funds area, the Committee has expressed a concern that transitional arrangements may result in some uncertainty which has the potential to affect the fortunes of more than 200 000 unit holders of ADFs valued at least $14 billion. Accordingly, in the interests of promoting certainty and stability within the superannuation industry, the Committee has recommended that funds managers and trustees be accorded at least equal status during the transition process. This will be achieved by providing both trustees and fund managers with equal rights to request the other's termination of appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most emotive and controversial aspect of the SIS legislation concerns clause 64, formerly clause 62, which prohibits superannuation funds from acquiring assets from members or members' relatives. In the course of its hearings, the Committee heard detailed accounts of abuse of the tax benefits afforded to superannuation funds. The Committee has noted arguments both for and against clause 64 and has recommended that clause 64 contain certain limited exemptions which will be accompanied by an increase in the powers of the sole purpose test. This will provide the Government with certain checks and balances to protect against the abuse of the concessional tax treatment afforded to superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further deterrent for potential clause 64 offenders is the custodial penalty that is attached to the offence. Although the Committee agrees that in some circumstances a gaol sentence will be appropriate, it is concerned that in other circumstances this could be too harsh. For this reason the Committee has recommended that the penalty for an offence under section 64(3) be amended to be a maximum of twelve months imprisonment and/or a pecuniary penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has examined in detail the provisions concerning the role of auditors and actuaries. Taking into account the critical role auditors will play in determining whether there have been breaches of the SIS legislation, the Committee has recommended that the Government countenance having set terms of appointment for auditors of superannuation funds and that consideration be given to the development of a register of auditors. The Committee has stressed that superannuation fund audits should be conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another major issue arising from the SIS Bills concerned their application to State and Territory superannuation schemes. The States and Territories raised concerns regarding the imposition by the Commonwealth on their own superannuation schemes which are already the subject of legislation and are required to undergo audits by state Auditors-General. In light of these views the Prime Minister has written to the States and Territories recommending that State and Territory superannuation schemes be exempted from the SIS legislation. The Committee understands that the states will work towards harmonising their prudential arrangements so that they are consistent with the SIS provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that certain amendments of a technical nature be made in the following areas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the definition of investment manager and custodian be clarified together with the restrictions on borrowing and the capital adequacy requirements for custodians;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the provisions concerning the use of Tax File Numbers (TFNs) be expanded in relation to their date of collection and use;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the provisions concerning public sector schemes, State rights, funds with Substituted Accounting Periods and regulated superannuation funds be clarified;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. the powers of the ISC with respect to exemptions and modifications be extended whilst the ISC and Australian Securities Corporation continue to liaise with a view to harmonising Commonwealth powers; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. minor technical amendments be made to improve the clarity of the legislation in certain areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Superannuation Industry (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of its on-going inquiry into superannuation the Committee identified a number of issues of particular interest to consumers where reform is required. These issues are of interest not only to consumers but also to those in the industry who seek to provide a high standard of service to their clients. Of paramount importance in this area, is the establishment, and effective operation, of the proposed Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted in its first report that the predominant view was that there was a need for the establishment of an independent dispute resolution body&mdash;something that would provide an alternative to the court system. The Committee is pleased to be able to support this legislation that establishes such a body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This body, the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal, will review decisions of trustees that have been the subject of a complaint, and have not been resolved by the trustees' internal dispute resolution mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treasurer has indicated that the review of some decisions will be excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction. These `excluded complaints' will include cases involving disability issues. The Committee has recommended that cases involving disability issues should not be automatically excluded. Rather, so-called disability cases, where the complaint essentially involves a procedural matter and cases that involve questions of legal interpretation should fall within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It is envisaged that in procedural matters the Tribunal will use its power to remit matters with directions to the trustees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to achieve a structure that provides a true alternative to the court system, the legislation, as a rule, does not permit legal representation before the Tribunal, although there is a discretion to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received submissions concerned about this provision and gave the issue considerable examination. The Committee was concerned to ensure that there was an appropriate balance between the objective of a fair, economical, informal and quick dispute resolution mechanism, and the necessity that consumers have access to appropriate assistance and advice in the preparation of their matters before the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason the Committee was particularly attracted to the concept submitted by the Consumer Credit Legal Service of Victoria  and the Consumer Credit Legal Centre of New South Wales. They suggested that an independent consumer advisory service, whether legal or multi-disciplinary, be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The roles of such a superannuation advisory service would include helping consumers to understand how to go about making their complaints; helping them to determine whether or not they have a legitimate complaint; and helping them to prepare the documents, the arguments and the proofs relevant to their case. The service would also play a role in the `macro' picture. By obtaining statistics and complaint data and by negotiating complaints, the service would be in a position to negotiate with industry and government in relation to changes in practice and policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the ISC secretariat is required by the legislation to provide assistance to complainants the Committee believes that it is important that there be an advisory service that is independent of the ISC. The Committee foresees a community advisory service playing a vital role in providing complainants with assistance in preparing their matters for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee agreed that initially this service should be funded by way of grants by the Commonwealth. In the longer term the Committee believes that consideration should be given to having the superannuation industry assist with the funding of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee convened public hearings on these bills in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. In addition, thanks to the cooperation of the Government, informal meetings were arranged between the committee members and officers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission at which amendments to improve the legislation were discussed.  Most of the amendments in the report have the in principle agreement of the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By virtue of its length and attention to detail this report will assist Senators in understanding the parameters of the new superannuation regulatory regime. I believe that, between the efforts of the Government in developing this package and the work of the Committee in acting as a sounding board for the superannuation industry, which includes consumers and providers, to ensure that the proposed law is good law, we now have the right policy mix.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the report to the Senate and in so doing I thank Committee members, Senators Sue West, Bruce Childs, Christopher Evans, Alan Ferguson, Cheryl Kernot, and the secretariat staff, Richard Gilbert, Krista Gerrard, Glenn Hunter and Cath Drinkwater, for their work in developing a comprehensive report on such complex and far reaching legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of eight bills before us will reshape the wool industry along the lines recommended by the Wool Industry Review Committee, known as the Garnaut committee. The aim is to reduce to two the number of bodies dealing with wool&mdash;one for promotion, research and development and the other to pay off the debt and reduce the stockpile by selling a predetermined amount of wool. When the debt is less than the value of the stockpile&mdash;hopefully by mid-1997&mdash;the latter body, called Wool International, will be privatised and owned by the very people who paid the debt taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A glance at the history of the wool industry reserve price scheme reveals that it operated for some 20 years before encountering a combination of difficulties in the early 1990s. These difficulties can be traced back to the 1980s, when prices for wool at auction increased dramatically, peaking at around 1,100c per kilogram. The reserve price, instead of being synchronised with the long-term price trend, was increased by about 60 per cent over two years to 870c a kilogram, where it remained for two seasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase effectively converted the reserve price scheme into a price setter and altered the price ratio of wool relative to other fibres. Instead of wool being around its historical price level&mdash;three times as dear as cotton&mdash;it became six times as dear as cotton, causing trade to shift to other fibres. Unfortunately, this shift coincided with the start of the world recession and the break-up of the old Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures show that in 1950-51 the total world production of fibres was around 10,332 million kilograms, with wool holding around 10 per cent of the market; man-made fibres, 16 per cent; and cotton, 74 per cent. By 1991-92, the total world fibre production was 39,151 million kilograms, with wool accounting for just 4.4 per cent; man-made fibres, 45.1 per cent; and cotton, 50.5 per cent. The floor price for wool meant that it was the most profitable farming enterprise with a guaranteed return and, as a result, many grain and beef farmers started running sheep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Production rose rapidly, from 700 million kilograms in the late 1970s and early 1980s to 1,100 million kilograms in 1989-90, when 5.7 million bales were offered for auction. The Australian Wool Corporation bought almost three million bales, or 52 per cent of the clip, that year. In 1990-91, production was 1,066 million kilograms, with 5.4 million bales offered for auction, and the AWC bought almost two million bales, or 35 per cent of the clip. The federal government moved to lower the floor price to 700c in 1990 and by February 1991 had scrapped it altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For equity reasons, the government continued to assist growers who had to sell their wool for that season. The cost to the federal government was $300 million. By that time, not only had the Australian Wool Corporation spent the $1.8 billion of growers' money it had in reserve but it had also borrowed $2.9 billion. The stockpile reached 4.5 million bales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government then formed the Australian Wool Realisation Commission to handle the disposal of the stockpile and to pay off the debt. It was determined that woolgrowers, although being required to pay off the debt, would cede ownership of the stockpile to the commission. The government established also a research and development corporation and the separate Wool Corporation to handle promotion and quality control. AWC stocks were frozen for the remainder of the 1990-91 season, with the exception of some long-term contracts and processed wool in stocks overseas. The government also gave the AWRC $22.5 million a year for two years to prevent it from having to hold a fire sale of its non-wool assets. A seven-year fixed repayment schedule was established. The schedule, which provided for annual payments ranging from $20 million in 1991-92 to $559 million in 1997-98, aimed to clear the outstanding debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system worked well for the first 12 months, putting the commission ahead of schedule. However, a significant decline in prices over the following 12 months led to renewed speculation about a fire sale. The federal government tried to overcome the problem by adding a year to the fixed disposal schedule and declaring that nothing had to be repaid this financial year. The debt is now $2.2 billion, the stockpile is 3.9 million bales, and production, estimated at 690 million kilograms, is still falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to quash continued fire sale speculation&mdash;and encourage the market to forward buy&mdash;this legislation adopts the Garnaut committee's suggestion of a fixed disposal schedule, rather than a fixed debt reduction schedule. The legislation also provides for fewer statutory bodies by combining the AWC and the AWRDC into one body called the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, and abolishing the Wool Industry Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AWRAP will be responsible for the allocation of research and development funds and generic promotion, while other functions will go to industry or government or be abandoned. The organisation will be encouraged to seek partnerships with commercial research and development ventures and to commercialise results as quickly as possible so that industry can obtain royalties, patents and other benefits to help fund further research. The $20 million given by the government this year for wool promotion runs out on 30 June. The minister has already said that the government will not provide further funds. However, I remind the government that in its primary industry policy for the last election it promised to ensure that the industry had sufficient funds for promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Wool Textile Organisation said that it was prepared to put in $100 million for generic promotion, but has since reneged because the government and, indeed, the coalition are not prepared to introduce a wool export tax. Such a tax would end up being paid by growers rather than processors. However, if the wool industry is to get out of this mess it must sell its stockpile, and promotion is desperately needed to help with this task. The government should look again at funding promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major body to be set up under this legislation is Wool International, which will manage the sale of the stockpile and the payment of debt. Initially, it will be a statutory body. Legal advice is that, under company law, if the debt exceeds the current value of assets the directors are obliged to call in a liquidator. Eventually, Wool International will be corporatised and then privatised by issuing shares to the people who have paid the 4.5 per cent wool tax since July 1993. The target privatisation date, pending legislation, is July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International's immediate task is to develop risk management tools, such as futures markets, wool bonds and options, as well as introduce total quality management programs. Apparently the minister plans to establish Wool International as soon as legislation is passed to allow it to take over from the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. This will allow more time to develop forward selling and risk management tools and ensure that it is ready to start the fixed disposal of the stockpile from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International will have to make a simple public statement, monthly and then quarterly, on its compliance with the disposal schedule, but not in relation to stockpile management. It will report confidentially and regularly to government while the government guarantee is in place or, in other words, until Wool International is privatised. Far from being a day-to-day trader or market speculator, Wool International will have the power to buy in wool only in specific circumstances where sales exceed fixed disposal requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will continue to guarantee the borrowings and will include the hedging activities of Wool International, as these are related directly to the financial management of the stockpile. The guarantee will not apply outside stockpile management. The minister has agreed that, if the debt is reduced sooner than anticipated, as would be the case if the price increased dramatically, Wool International can be privatised earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut committee considered six options for dealing with the stockpile and found that the long-term demand for wool would improve if at least half the stockpile were sold off rather than destroyed. The rationale is that Australia will find new customers and new uses for wool and thereby increase wool's total share of the world apparel market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under arrangements outlined in this legislation, speculators will hopefully see that there is money to be made in wool and start to invest. There will be no such investment if people are worried about the possibility of wool being dumped on the market to meet a repayment schedule. My colleague in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), put it thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Garnaut report now moves the wool industry into the commercial world. I hope the future of the wool industry is secure after 1997 with few statutory bodies; with quality standards enforced at the shed level and through processing; with wool growers maintaining their 4.4 per cent of the total fibre market; and with a free market for wool with no levies imposed by either the government or their own organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to turn to the amendments that were moved in the House of Representatives. I am pleased that those amendments, which were foreshadowed by the coalition, were accepted by the government following negotiations with the coalition and input from the Wool Council of Australia. The amendments included the creation of selection committees to nominate persons suitable for ministerial appointment to the boards of Wool International and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, with the Wool Council nominating one member for each selection committee. Previously the minister was to appoint all board members. The amendments also included the retention of provisions allowing the Commonwealth to contribute money for wool promotion. Originally these were to have been phased out. The amendments also include calling on AWRAP, which is wholly funded by grower levies, to consult with the Wool Council of Australia regarding its operations, and extending the deadline for AWRAP to divest its quality management functions by one year to 1 January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to reflect on the Senate's Rural and Regional Affairs Committee, which last week heard views from various people in government and industry ranging from selling the stockpile for 150c a kilogram to wanting none of the stockpile sold unless it made 600c a kilogram. Economist Mr Henry Haszler told the committee that wool used in insulation batts had sold at $1.50 a kilogram and that such alternatives were, in his words, `worth considering' in relation to the stockpile. By contrast, Mr Gregory Walcott of the Balmoral branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation argued that the break-even price for growers was about 600c. His counterpart, Mr Allan Small, also expressed concern about the level of wool debt and advocated that the government and industry take on, in their words, `combined responsibility'. Perhaps Professor Ross Garnaut best summed up the situation when he told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preparation of the report itself and the subsequent discussion have occurred against a backdrop of deep economic travail in the wool industry and in rural Australia, and that made us very much mindful of our heavy responsibilities. We did not find a magic wand to wave and cure the problems.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did come up with a set of recommendations which, we judged, if implemented consistently and effectively, would give us the best path out of the current difficulties. Always judgments were on a balance of probabilities because there was no magic wand and there are uncertainties, but we were confident about our path being better than alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite many submissions, there were no new workable ideas at that hearing or at the 25 meetings held around Australia by the coalition shadow minister for primary industry, Mr John Anderson. We are pleased that the government has already accepted our amendments and that the Senate committee has returned the legislation without amendment. For these reasons, the coalition supports this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 and associated bills are to give effect to the popularly known Garnaut report. The Australian Democrats want to put on record their recognition of the amount of work that has gone into this and the dire situation that faces the wool industry unless quite radical measures are introduced as soon as possible. I refer to the Senate committee inquiry held last Friday and commend to honourable senators the report that came out of that committee as being very well worth reading. It gives a very good summary of the concerns raised at that inquiry. The report is worthwhile reading for anyone interested in primary industry and the wool industry in particular. I believe that all the witnesses helped our understanding of this important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that serious concerns were raised in that committee hearing by the Balmoral branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation, the Victorian Farmers Federation itself, the National Council of Woolselling Brokers, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters and other people, including Mr Malcolm Fraser. On the other hand, the legislation as it is before us has been supported by many people, including the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Wool Council of Australia and most of the peak bodies, the government, the coalition and, of course, Professor Ross Garnaut himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the general thrust, but we do have some reservations, and I will detail these a little later on. Already, conversations with the Wool Council and the coalition, with our support, have resulted in amendments which I believe improve the bill. Two further amendments which I will move at a later date will improve the legislation even further, and I seek the support of the Senate for those. Parliamentarians of all political persuasions are committed to getting the industry back on its feet, and certainly the Democrats are. The plight of the industry is well known. In the first speech I made in this parliament, I detailed some of my personal contacts and the agony I experienced listening to people's stories. One cannot remain unaffected by the personal tragedies in the community which the legislation we are dealing with today seeks to mitigate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should like to read into the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> some of the evidence given by a woolgrower from south-western Victoria, Mrs Margaret Watt, because I believe that, as she indicated to the committee, it puts a human face on our discussions. This is what she said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report suggests a price improvement in the long term. Our real concerns are that as rural communities we are fighting to survive in the short term. There is a very real despair, a despair born of weariness and disillusionment, which is eating away at communities. Even reading the Garnaut report, far less trying to understand it, is beyond many. I am sure that I do not speak just for our woolgrowing community in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constant pressure that is building up for farming people to meet their interest payments and their budgets is really eating in. Costs, therefore, are being cut back. The result of that is that ordinary working farming families are taking on heavier workloads. There is further physical exhaustion and mental exhaustion resulting. Government cutbacks are further eroding what were once very viable communities.</PARA>
<PARA>I want the Senate to know that this debate is being conducted against that background of rural communities which are past desperation point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn now to some of the specific issues. In terms of the fixed release schedule, we support its general thrust but we still have some questions, and these were underlined by the evidence given in that Senate committee inquiry. The question we still ask is whether it is good commercial practice to determine months and even years ahead how much of the stockpile we are prepared to sell. Professor Garnaut and others believe that it is necessary to regulate the market in order to give it certainty. Others raise the problem of applying mathematical formulas to markets which do not respond to fixed mathematical regulation in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem with the fixed release schedule. It does not take account of types of wool in the stockpile, and these ought to be in rough proportion to what the market requires. I am reassured by conversations I have had with representatives from the Wool Council&mdash;they have been most helpful&mdash;that they will take on board the concern about the types of wool, as part of the management of Wool International and its management of the stockpile. I note that there is a requirement for Wool International to report monthly to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that our amendment strengthens the purpose of the fixed release schedule. It also provides two safety mechanisms. The first is an upper market indicator of 800c, if the market overheats. We know that overheating in the market is not good for market stability and people begin to shift to other fibres because of it. Our proposal would enable Wool International to release more from the stockpile to dampen down the market if this happens. The second safety mechanism, a lower market indicator of 400c&mdash;we hope the market will never again reach this low figure&mdash;will send a signal to the market that Australia will not permit a fire sale of its valuable asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present decline in production was another concern that was raised. We believe that the legislation needs to send a signal to growers to maintain and lift production. These signals must give confidence to the market, and to growers, so that production will continue. Last year, production was a little over 800 million kilograms. This year, estimated production is around 690 million kilograms or less. It is important that we have signals to secure production, and these must be part of the whole exercise equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some concerns about Wool International. The legislation will give effect to the establishment of Wool International as a government instrumentality until the stockpile is under control, and then it will be privatised by issuing shares to growers and others in proportion to the amount of wool tax they pay. We have a concern that, if growers experience liquidity problems, they will sell the shares and that the very good thrust of this legislation, which places control and ownership in the hands of growers, will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that, if non-growers begin to purchase the shares in Wool International, control will pass from growers and will be concentrated in, perhaps, transnational agribusiness or in the hands of a few of the very large growers. It seems to us that Garnaut even suggests that this could be desirable. On page 6 of his report he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reserve Price Scheme. . . discouraged the emergence of large, integrated multinational companies in the wool industry. The large integrated companies that play a major role in promotion, research and development in the cotton and synthetics industries, have no counterparts in wool.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Garnaut then goes on to decry this. The Democrats do not accept Professor Garnaut's analysis of the desirability of having large integrated multinational companies in the wool industry. Indeed, we believe that the long-term best interests of the wool industry in Australia are assured by the present situation in which the majority of wool growers are family farmers and, therefore, part of the network of Australian small businesses. These concerns are expressed by this industry and other rural industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been corresponding with people in Europe, in particular with a German economist and theologian by the name of Ulrich Duchrow, who has worked for the World Council of Churches and for the Lutheran Church in Germany. He has drawn my attention to the Aachen declaration, which was made in Europe in July 1987. It was a declaration by farmers and consumers for a new agricultural policy. This declaration is available, if honourable senators are interested in it, in both English and German. In commenting on the declaration, Dr Duchrow writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capitalisation of agriculture has led to its industrialisation and to transnational agro-business, which results not only in hunger in the two-thirds world but also in driving farms (apart from big industrial ones) into debt and destroying them, in the progressive degradation of the land's natural basis, in dangers to the health of consumers and, specially in the EC, in the fleecing of taxpayers. This state of affairs is well known. It is equally well known who profits from this: agro-business, the banks and the big industrial farmers.</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds familiar. It will be an important debate for another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues are the buy-back provision for Wool International to cover any shortfall in a fixed schedule period and the provision in the legislation for Wool International to initiate an active futures trade. The Australian Democrats' amendments seek clarification and an assurance from the government that it will cover any trading losses that occur in the trade of wool stocks or futures until Wool International is privatised. It is unrealistic to expect woolgrowers to fund these risky activities as they are being imposed on Wool International by the government and not by the growers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parallel concern is that the 4.5 per cent wool tax has been accepted by growers as a necessary means of servicing the stockpile debt but not to fund risky Wool International activities. It is not too much to suggest that it may be more just to return surplus wool tax to growers than to allow Wool International to use the levy to play with the market. It is the belief of some that a viable futures market will happen when certainty is given to the market and the stockpile is reduced. In conclusion, I assure the Senate that the Democrats support all attempts to bring viability and profitability to the wool industry and to all rural industries. We support the thrust of this legislation. I call on all honourable senators to support our modest amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I rise to speak on a wool matter, probably for the fifth time in the last three years, I must start off by declaring my interest as a woolgrower. The wool legislation is the fifth major package of legislation that has been in front of the parliament in the last three years. I know it is easy to say `I told you so', but I did say on those five occasions that we were not going down the right track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just listened to Senator Woodley's contribution to the wool debate. Even though I agreed with most of what he had to say, because it is evidently the way we have to go following the Garnaut report&mdash;which I support, if not fully&mdash;I believe that he is attempting to go back to something we had in the past. What has been wrong with the situation we have had in the last five years, since that disaster of May 1988 when the decision was taken by the Wool Council to increase the reserve price from 690c to 870c? That was probably the most disastrous decision the wool industry in Australia has made. Unfortunately, it was supported by the minister at the time, Mr Kerin. I note that Mr Kerin spoke on the matter in the House of Representatives but he did not quietly back down or admit the mistake he had made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the point, Senator Woodley's amendments tend to do what we did before&mdash;leave a back door open for escape. Let us this time fix the situation forever and not leave a back door. If there is a back door for escape, world traders in wool will be waiting for us to open that back door and we will be off again. I believe we have got to stick fully with what Garnaut has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You do not need me to tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Australian woolgrowers are in an extreme situation, especially where there is no other industry they can turn to. There are not many woolgrowing areas of Australia where something else cannot be done, but there are some, such as the Murchison among the pastoral areas of Western Australia, where one cannot hope to run cattle. In certain rainfall areas of Victoria, as in South Australia and some of the medium rainfall areas of Western Australia, one just cannot run cattle and it is too wet for grains except maybe coarse grains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the farmers who cannot do anything else, the situation is very bad. There are farmers having either to move off the property or to find something else to do, hoping the wool industry will come back. The wool industry will come back. It has come back every time. With the right sort of legislation, the right sort of scheme, we will be able to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present we have a stockpile of some four million bales and a debt of roughly $2 billion. What has been driving the price down in these last few months is that we have annual repayments to reduce the debt. That may have seemed in order when we last debated here, but I certainly questioned whether it would work. As we approach that repayment schedule, the pressure is on. The buyers know that we have to sell more assets. Assets can be sold only once. We can sell more wool that is growing on the sheep's back&mdash;that keeps coming in, even if it gets less and less&mdash;but once the assets have been sold, they are gone for good. The government did alleviate that one payment last year. I thank the government for its consideration in doing that; otherwise wool would have been driven further into the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to get away from that situation. The situation has been helped by the Australian wool production. I think Senator Woodley got his figures wrong there. We are down now to 690 million kilograms of production, and that has helped. We would have had to meet a debt rescheduling payment of $600 million this year&mdash;$200 million for interest and $400 million&mdash;which we would not have been in the position to do without driving wool production down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could have imposed up to 15 per cent tax if we had stayed in that situation. It is presently at 12 per cent. We had a special one-off 13 per cent a couple of years ago and we have 12 per cent at present, but the government could go to 15 and then really drive wool through the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report recommends reducing the bodies to one called AWRAP for promotion, research and development, and another one&mdash;Wool International&mdash;to take over management of the stockpile. It has already been pointed out that, when the stockpile is removed, that will go private. The shares will be issued according to tax paid by growers between now and 1996 or 1997, or whatever it is. I believe that is a top idea because they are the ones who have to meet the payments and take care of the stockpile. It is fair that they will be issued the shares, because the ones who built up the stockpile between 1988 and 1990 were fringe woolgrowers who came in from the cattle industry and other industries to get on board something that had a fixed price, a bottom price. Now a lot of them have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no fears. There are a lot of fears being expressed around the country about Wool International but, as Senator Tambling pointed out, if the stockpile is in manageable proportions by then it can be privatised straight away. I am not one of those who believe that in two years time we will not be able to supply all the wool needed. Colleagues such as Mr Sinclair propose that; I normally do not disagree with what he has to say but this time I do. If we cannot supply it because of that fixed schedule of reduction, what a good problem to have. That is something we have to stick to. As I said, we cannot have a back door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a fixed schedule of reduction by the number of bales. It is 27,000 to 29,000 per month between July 1994 and December 1994, plus or minus five per cent. Of course, they can sell more than that after 1 January 1995, but Wool International has to buy back what is coming off the sheep's back. That has got a side benefit that I have not heard mentioned yet: it freshens up the stockpile. A lot of the stockpile is deteriorating; it has been in store a long time and the steel bands are rusting and staining. If Russia comes in and wants a million bales, it can be bought fresh off the sheep's back. It does help to freshen that up, because I believe that is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few things I would like to address quickly. Firstly, we will be helped by increasing our price if we can get the balance between what is going on in the market and the demand. Australia sold 890 million kilograms last year. We have been helped by the fact that Argentina has dropped production from 200 million kilograms to 90 million kilograms annually and South Africa has dropped from 100 to 65. We have been helped in all those areas, and I believe we should stick to this. Some of my colleagues believe we should have a minimum reduction schedule and not a fixed one. We cannot get away from that. I am on record as saying that, and I want to put it on record again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to express the worries of the wool industry about the ever rising costs. We did get extra costs put on us in the last budget sitting which, unfortunately, we have to accept. Shearing costs have to be looked at. This year, shearing costs are generally 40 per cent of the clip. I have declared my interest; I am a woolgrower, but in my family I have very little to do with the industry. One thing I do is write out the cheque at the end of shearing. I see the cheques that come in; I bank them when the proceeds of the wool clip come in. I know that 40 per cent is eaten up by that alone, whereas in New Zealand the costs are 33 per cent less. In Australia it costs roughly $3 a head to shear a sheep on full contract; in New Zealand it costs 60 cents. That is for shearing only. The cost is double that. So it can be done in New Zealand for $1.20. There is a vast difference between the two, and we have to look at a way to get that down, but not by cutting shearers' rates. The one lot in Australia who earn their money are the shearers. There are other ways, such as addressing the costs of transport and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to delay the Senate. I fully support the position taken by the government and I fully support Garnaut. Let me stress again that we should not leave the back door open this time. Let us stay with it, and we will have a good industry again. </PARA>

If the minister had been prepared to explain Garnaut and foster the industry discussion that was necessary, it would have been very much appreciated. As for Garnaut's explanation to woolgrowers, Minister Crean was absent without leave. But I do congratulate the minister on his setting up of the review committee; its members, Ross Garnaut, Rod Price and Stephen Bennett; the general thrust of its reforms; and the speed of change that will flow from the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every one of the 65,000 woolgrowers out there has the capacity to contribute more to reducing our foreign debt and creating the common wealth of the nation than any government senator. Whilst Australia no longer rides on the sheep's back, it was a much more prosperous country when we did. Having said that, and with the reservations about the wool package, which I will highlight, the time for political and industrial debate is over for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals have had over two months of intense industry and academic scrutiny. While there are various views as to how successful the stockpile reduction program will be, almost everybody agrees&mdash;from the peak grower body, the Wool Council, down&mdash;that the existing debt repayment schedule is not a goer. It is not sustainable, and has to be changed. The time to build up is now in the hands of the industry. At the same time, responsibility for how we descended into this awful crisis remains very much with this Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1989-90, as highlighted by my colleague Senator Panizza, the reserve price scheme came under extreme pressure for all the reasons well debated over the last four years. I understand the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, was advised that there was no way the reserve price could be reduced from 870c to 700c clean, and the scheme survive. Further, the minister said that the price of 700c clean was immutable. This famous political promise will live forever in the minds of growers and the world wool trade where, until recent times, your word was your bond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world wool trade, at the time, did not understand the concept of a political promise as the Australian Labor Party does. John Kerin, therefore, bears a very great responsibility for the debt, as does the government he served. After all, it is the debt and who will service it that is the problem&mdash;not the existence of the stockpile, which remains an asset. Whilst I favour the quantity based disposal schedule, some argue that any quantity to be sold from the stockpile, in any period, should be a minimum amount only, and that flexibility should be provided to allow additional quantities to be quit if market circumstances permit. This is the concern if there is an immediate boom in prices. There could be an indicator price that is going through the roof and there still be 3.5 million bales in the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposite view is often taken, funnily enough, by the same people&mdash;that is that if demand is relatively weak, a fixed quantity disposal will only depress prices further. If the price of wool recovers too quickly, then Wool International can be privatised. Further consider that at a modest current value of $500 a bale&mdash;and there are nearly 4 million bales still in the stockpile&mdash;the market indicator only has to move a small amount from the current disastrous 470c clean to get past the current $2.2 million debt. So to give the stockpile a real value is only an eye blink away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the price is relatively weak, then the Garnaut proposals fall over. But I do not believe that the price will be weak because of the current fall in physical production. I do not believe that the downside risk is as great as the potential upside, and the most attractive option therefore is to go with Garnaut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if there were a real and properly argued alternative to Garnaut, it would not stand up because this government will not bail the costs of the stockpile indefinitely. Growers cannot afford the present rate of wool tax so it is impossible for them to contribute more, as is permitted under the existing legislation&mdash;up to 15 per cent from the present 8 1/2 per cent that they are paying. I reiterate: the game is up for wool under the existing arrangements. This is the best alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see two requirements for Garnaut&mdash;firstly, from the growers' point of view, an early increase in price so that the industry can survive; and, secondly, from the trade point of view, a stable and steady price. To a large extent, the interests of both growers and processors should converge. Garnaut offers this chance because he offers a type of Clayton's stockpile&mdash;a stockpile you do not have when you do have a stockpile. It will allow market forces to be as close as they will be when the stockpile no longer exists. Those signals will be to both the growers and the trade. The amount of wool sold will depend, as always, on production and not on a fixed amount coming out of the stockpile. The `risk management tools' proposed by Garnaut will be an important part of reducing the effect of the release schedule's market influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By allowing a fixed reduction which, as I have said, is fortuitously attached to a substantially reduced physical production, with the threat that the stockpile can be used to fill immediately gaps between supply and demand&mdash;there is enough wool in the pile to fill an awful lot of gaps for a long time&mdash;there is little chance of a significant price increase. This will no longer be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big change between the start-up scheme of a debt repayment schedule and a stockpile reduction arrangement is this: in 1991 the government said to growers, `You pay off the debt but you will give the ownership of the stockpile to the AWRC'. Professor Garnaut says that, on the balance of probabilities, there will be value in the stockpile if handled the way he proposes. I believe him. It is only fair, therefore, that traditional woolgrowers&mdash;the only people still growing wool and therefore carrying the debt of those who have taken their profits in better times and have now left the industry&mdash;should have the chance of equity in their stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some particular concerns about the proposals. Both the Garnaut report and the minister emphasised the need to make the wool industry `demand driven' rather than `supply driven'. However, it is extremely disappointing that a government which so vocally supports a demand driven wool industry has just ceased all government contributions to wool promotion, since this is a vital way the government can assist the industry. While the legislation has been amended in the House of Representatives to allow the Commonwealth to contribute funds for wool promotion, Minister Crean has made it perfectly clear that that will not be done. He says, `Rid me of responsibility for this troublesome beast. Rid me of any responsibility for wool'. This is despite Professor Garnaut having said on promotion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is particularly unfortunate that at this difficult time Australian wool growers should be left to carry the burden of promotion alone.</PARA>
<PARA>The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This heightens the importance of contributions from textile manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA>It surely does, but the government bears an enormous responsibility as well. It cannot and must not walk away from an industry that is gasping for breath, needs to be market driven and has paid a lot of tax when times were better, and whose prosperity is essential for control of government liability with respect to both RAS funding and social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot leave promotion without making a personal comment about the vast amount of money&mdash;over $500 million since the 1980s&mdash;spent to promote wool. I wonder how much more successful the promotion would have been if performance based private firms had been given the task. As a woolgrower, I do not feel that I have had value for money. In fact, I feel the opposite. Let us hope that the IWS and other commercial promotions that come out of the AWRAP will be more successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some quick comments which are of great importance to the debate. An enormous amount of damage has been done to the wool industry and all export industries over the last few years by the sorts of economic circumstances in which the industry has operated. High levels of inflation relative to those of our competitors have pushed costs up at a time when growers have been least able to cope. The stripping out of the indirect taxes, as we proposed in Fightback, was of enormous attraction to growers. The cost savings which New Zealand has accomplished&mdash;as raised by Senator Panizza&mdash;through the implementation of a similar tax regime, has enabled growers there to be substantially more competitive, both in shearing costs, where about $100 million per year would be saved if that regime were implemented here, and in transport costs, which from farm gate to wharf are about two times less than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be few pats on the back here for the government. When the minister talks in glowing terms about value adding, he knows more than anybody&mdash;as a former president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions&mdash;why Australian scouring, top making, spinning and weaving processors have voted with their feet and have gone offshore. They have gone because of our intolerable industrial relations record and work practices. The best thing he can do for value adding in this country is to clean out the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful for the opportunity given to me by Riverina Wool Combing and Canobolas Top Making to see their operations. I commend them for the way they have shown initiative in this most difficult business, especially considering all the impediments put in their way. Riverina Wool Combing's spending of about $30 million to set up another scouring line is a remarkable vote of confidence in the industry at this time. It has great confidence in the future, as I do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If this package of wool bills goes anywhere near alleviating the appalling doldrums in which the Australian wool industry finds itself, it is timely that this legislation be passed. Unfortunately, the Australian Labor Party government has alarmingly demonstrated what it thinks of wool and the wool industry. We have seen the government put on the guillotine not once but on both occasions in recent times when wool bills have come before the other place. That is an indication of what the government thinks of the wool industry and those involved in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also regrettable that today in this chamber we have only limited time to consider key aspects of this industry which is of such great importance to Australia. This government has presided over some of the most appalling days of the wool industry's history. In the late 1980s, the floor price went from 460c to 870c a kilogram in just three years, at times when not only this government but industry members also participated in knocking the industry from its solid foundations. It does not matter how one looks at the situation, the government has a moral obligation and an economic responsibility to attend to the current crisis within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not just been the actions of those involved in the industry that have led to its current circumstances. Probably the worst aspect of the gradual destabilisation of the wool industry has been the interest rate regime of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who jacked up interest rates in past years. That was devastating to many industries but in particular to the wool industry, and it caused many of the growers to leave the industry. It has also crippled financially a good many of them for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been left with a wool stockpile of over four million bales and the debt is still $2.2 billion. The cost of interest and storage on the stockpile alone amounts to about $200 million a year. Very little wool has been sold from the stockpile over the past year, predominantly because the Wool Commission only sells above the auction price and for cash. It is not so much a case of the nation riding on the sheep's back these days but more a case of the wool industry struggling to carry the entire weight of an overburdened and overtaxed nation on its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such is the grim picture of the wool industry in Australia. There have been few moments in the six years that I have been in this place when the Australian wool industry has not found itself in the spotlight or in some difficulty or crisis. The Keating government itself once again realised that it was in strife in the wool industry when, a little over two months ago, yet another review into the wool industry was handed down in an attempt to reconcile the situation in which the industry and the government have found themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An immense amount of hype has surrounded the industry in recent years. For a very long time, the industry has admitted to being production focused, concentrating on producing wool and improving quality. Brokers have focused on advancing the industry by making improvements to handling and sampling the product in wool stores. Exporters have concentrated on improving delivery while competing in an ebbing market with a diversity of customers, who range from those using very high-tech operations to those using 80-year-old equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian wool industry has been inward looking. It has been working to its own schedule and it has been fulfilling its own requirements first. As a result, it now rests in a precarious position. It has been suggested that the industry has not been able to deliver a product, either constantly or consistently, to customers' mills and that this has produced, in customers, a lack of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report resulting from the Garnaut inquiry is set to restructure the industry and set it on its feet again&mdash;a feat that both the Hawke and Keating Labor governments have found impossible, despite repeated attempts to get it right. This Labor government has consistently got it wrong. Let us hope the improved industry communication will instil confidence and send a message to industry customers that we are now ready to meet their requirements head on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although woolgrowers are still in deep financial trouble, and have cut right back on wool production, there is still too much wool in the stockpile and too few serious buyers of the calibre that the industry needs to sustain it. Let us hope that the Garnaut report will set this situation right. Clearly, we have to sell the stockpile to revitalise the industry, otherwise the industry will never again enjoy the eminence that it once had in former days. This package of eight wool related bills seeks to restructure and streamline the industry so that it can begin its path to recovery and regain its premier position in the international textile market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite numerous botched Labor government attempts to kick-start Australia to develop a sound manufacturing base, we are still relying too much on natural resources. We should be looking at value added industries developing from the resources themselves. The concept of value adding is a good one, but it must be done at competitive rates. Many countries buy our raw materials simply to give work to their own people. We run the risk of cutting off our markets if we deny them those raw materials. If we cannot value add here as cheaply as it can be done overseas we reduce the competitiveness of our raw products and that must not be allowed to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are an exporting nation. We should be able to emerge as the producer of superior quality value added products which attract premiums and deliver decent returns to producers. After all, we export virtually all of our wool and cotton. Only five years ago, we earned over $6 billion from wool: it was our number one export. Today that figure has been halved. Less than 18 per cent of the woolgrowers of Australia produce more than 100 bales of wool a year. That means that 82 per cent produce less than that each year. That is a lot of small operators and small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the sad thing is that life on the land in many sectors of rural industry has deteriorated to a parlous state. About 28 per cent of farmers feel like giving life on the land away completely and 20 per cent would walk away if they could. Thanks to this government's mismanagement, farming profitability is at an all time low&mdash;rock-bottom. In the past three years, specialist woolgrowers have accumulated huge business losses of around $107,000 for each year. Specialist sheep producers will lose, on average, about $36,100 this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of Garnaut and this legislation is to change the management of the stockpile. At present, the stockpile is poorly managed by the commission. Because it has an excess, buyers do not have to buy in bulk and they know that they can return for more at any time. Buyers are reluctant to hold their own stocks or buy well in advance. Last year only 20 million kilograms, or 100,000 bales, were sold. This represents only 1.15 per cent of the world's wool production. It is highly unlikely that the wool industry will recover until the stockpile is reduced by more than half, about two million bales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Garnaut and his colleagues on the inquiry put forward and analysed six options for dealing with the stockpile, but chose out of those options to recommend selling wool according to a fixed quantity schedule. The Garnaut view is that long-term demand for wool will be better placed if half the stockpile is sold, rather than destroyed&mdash;as some have suggested&mdash;since new customers and new uses for wool will be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although some growers, as well as wool brokers and exporters, have reservations about the recommendation for fixed stock disposal, it is the best available option&mdash;25,000 bales a month, commencing next month, until June next year, then 55,000 bales a month from next July to June 1997, disposal being based on the tender process. This will account for 190,000 bales or 38 million kilos of wool, but disposal will be no longer be guided by a fixed repayment schedule. The debt repayment schedule will be abolished and Wool International will establish a wool futures market and improve other means of transfer of wool ownership, such as loans, options and bonds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Garnaut report recommendations encourage people to invest in forward contracts and futures, and if speculators see that there is money to be made in wool and so invest, the stockpile will eventually dwindle. But there will be no investment if buyers worry that wool will be dumped onto the market just to meet the requirements of the debt repayments schedule. Given that woolgrowers throughout Australia know very little about the detail of what the Garnaut report contains or proposes, it is understandable from the meetings of growers that I have attended at Burra and Naracoorte, in South Australia, that they are concerned about the release system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In world terms, supply is way down in comparison with recent years. In both South Africa and Argentina, our other major competitors in the industry, it is down 35 and 45 per cent respectively. In Australia it is down 69 per cent. If that is the case, wool may be in greater demand than the fixed release from the stockpile will supply before the financial year is out, because the fixed release scheme is based on the fact that the current annual production around the world is down to the point where a fixed release scheme does have a chance of working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any rate, given the misfortune that our once great Australian wool industry is now experiencing, the sooner the stockpile is released, the better the future prospects will be. The stockpile is costing growers money&mdash;to the tune of about $60 per bale or $200 million a year&mdash;to store. And it is costing growers in a psychological sense. It always hangs over their heads, and it psychologically depresses the market to know the size of this glut. The wool industry cannot afford to return to the old boom and bust era, where the price goes up if supply drops off and consequently no-one buys wool, so production falls and the price falls, ad infinitum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must press on with reductions in protection, which impose enormous costs on woolgrowers. Wholesale sales tax puts an additional $200 million impost on our farmers&mdash;about $1,600 per farm per year. The government has added at least another 10 per cent a year to those costs in the current budget. We are certainly not doing much for the competitiveness of wool against other fibres by adding 5c a litre to the cost of fuel. And shearing currently takes about 40 per cent of growers' returns from wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the government honestly believe that the industry can soak up these costs when it is assailed by drought, international depression and recession, and international competition? The government taxes wool producers when it hits the transport industry at three times the rate at which it taxes other industries. Given the disastrous manner in which this government and past Labor governments have dealt with the industry, I can only hope that this package of legislation at long last will assist the industry in a speedy recovery. Therefore, the legislation is worthy of our support. </PARA>

We understand that the bills are designed to enact the outcome of the Garnaut report and it is my understanding that the Garnaut inquiry was designed to address some of the problems which are being experienced by the wool industry in Australia. The concerns that I express are not so much about what is in the report and, therefore, this series of bills, but what has been left out, either by the limitations of the terms of reference or by the fairly narrow, uncreative response to those terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two questions I would like to ask: firstly, is there a wish to create employment in the wool industry; and, secondly, is there a concern about the viability of the industry? Obviously, those have been addressed, but I wonder whether all of the possibilities for either employment or viability have been canvassed in this solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem that has not been properly dealt with is the lack of recognition of the local market and value-added production, and regional based solutions to the wool stockpile. Like most people in this chamber, including Senator Chamarette, I have received briefings on the wool industry by the National Farmers Federation, by the Australian Wool Council and by government. I have been approached by a number of people who work in enterprises which use wool, an example being the Weavers Guild in Western Australia. Its members have told me that they find it very difficult to get hold of wool in the quantities they require. When they do get hold of it, it is extremely expensive. I cannot help but wonder why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told that it is not viable to sell wool in those quantities. In regard to the potential for highly value-added enterprise, I have been told that the local market is a very small proportion of the total market for wool in Australia. I agree, but I do not agree that that means that we take away the emphasis from promoting what is possibly a viable local market, with the potential for value-added industry and employment creation, for assisting regions where wool is a major industry, and for developing an export industry where exports are a major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export industries do not necessarily just develop as export industries. In Australia over the last couple of years, where people have decided to make highly value-added, high quality products from Australian wool, export markets have developed quite quickly. To me, the very narrow focus of selling the clip has overshadowed the fact that promotional funding for the local market means that one is jumping a step. The viability of the industry cannot develop bottom up; perhaps we are looking too much from the top down or looking too much for the big picture rather than looking at the potential for regional approaches which enable a greater spread of employment within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kinds of enterprises that I am talking about also mean employment potential for women and young people within regions. This report has not adequately addressed those kinds of employment opportunities in the wool industry. They are just as important in providing employment. In my opinion and from the figures that I have seen, the industry holds the potential for greater employment than is currently available just through wool growing and concentrating on wool only as an export commodity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that, while the stockpile is being privatised, there is no role for government in providing grants for new enterprises which are prepared to create employment in the wool industry. If the actual amount of wool on the local market is not very large, one would welcome the provision of wool grants by government to private industry to encourage new enterprises or enterprises which currently use wool to create employment and new products. The potential for government to encourage enterprise using wool grants, even if they are only temporary grants, is great. I have heard on national radio these kinds of solutions canvassed by women in the industry. It seems that the men are not listening because they feel that the greater picture is what they have to concentrate on and that the smaller picture is not worth looking at. I think that is a mistake. These other creative solutions have to be looked at more seriously and given more time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the lack of recognition of the local market and the need for the wool industry to seek an integrated regional approach, to look at some of the problems on the farming side of things and with the industry's viability.

The package of bills establishes a new institutional structure and marketing arrangement in the wool industry. The four statutory wool industry organisations which currently have responsibility for marketing and promotion, research and development, and development of industry policy will be replaced by only two&mdash;the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, which will be responsible for generic promotion and research and development, and Wool International, which will market the stockpile and foster the development of risk management and marketing mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will be aware of the approach I have taken and the concern I have had in relation to realisation of the stockpile in the past. It has not been a marketing exercise but it has been done on a liquidation approach, and I think that has been one of the devastating features of the previous arrangement.

I believe that these bills will provide only an imperfect, short-term solution to the ailments of the industry, not a long-term solution. They do provide, nevertheless, a strategy for disposal of the stockpile, but I doubt whether they provide a strategy for the long-term planning of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This position was also recognised by Malcolm Fraser. In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> he was reported as having made the comment that he believes the Garnaut report has the potential to damage the industry and he is concerned that that report has been so widely accepted. I share those feelings. It is almost like clutching at lifebuoys without being aware of the weakness of the rope that is intended to bring the survivors to the security of those who have been throwing out the lifelines. It is no use throwing out lifelines if that rope is too fragile and has the potential to break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various groups involved in the wool industry&mdash;growers, processors and exporters&mdash;have been vocal about their attitudes to the Garnaut report and the wool legislation. The concerns of wool exporters in particular should be taken into account more than they have been at the moment, because they are ones who every day put their capital on the line and manage the risk so that woolgrowers can, without risk, receive their cash on their wool sales within a few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long the wool producers and the wool exporters have operated independently of each other. These two groups need to cooperate and start working together for the benefit of all involved in the wool industry. The Australian Council of Wool Exporters has complained that the government's latest plan has ignored the views of all customers and will mean more volatility in the market. It is also concerned that Wool International is empowered to buy wool if its sales or deliveries against any of its forward-selling instruments exceed its schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of Wool International is provided for in the Wool International Bill 1993, which sets out its functions, powers, membership and related matters. Wool International will be responsible for the selling of the wool stockpile, subject to the fixed disposal schedule, and fostering the development of forward and risk management mechanisms such as wool futures and marketing mechanisms. Initially, Wool International will be structured as a statutory body but along commercial lines to reflect its ultimate transformation, first, to a fully government-owned company and then later to a privatised company. The target date is July 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of its privatisation it is intended that shares will be issued to wool tax payers in proportion to the component of the 4.5 per cent wool tax they pay for debt management as from July 1993 and any voluntary contributions they make. But here I have a problem. The grower funds, compulsorily levied to fund the stockpile, are to be used to fund Wool International, a trading and financial corporation which is essentially going to compete with the private sector. The fixed disposal schedule suggested in the legislation introduces a slight variation to the Garnaut recommendations&mdash;27,700 to 29,100 bales a month from July to December 1994 and 182,000 to 192,000 bales a quarter from January 1995 to June 1997 or until Wool International is privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw now on the experience of a very successful small private buyer with which I have a lot of association&mdash;Saunders Mitchell Pty Ltd. This firm has been a successful exporter from my home state. It has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some important (and welcome) changes have been made to the conditions under which the stockpile is sold and to the prospective activities of Wool International. Thus the fixed schedule selling program will not commence until July 1994. Until that time the agreed and understood policies of the AWRC will be followed. This is just as well because under the original proposal only 40KT could be sold out of the stockpile. With a forecast clip of 690KT this would have given a maximum availability of only 730KT. Compare this with the 826KT sold to the trade last season, and we had the potential for a massive market squeeze.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely some flexibility in stockpile selling must be considered when we are looking at possible market opportunities out to four years hence! Not according to Mr Crean!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Wool International will be still permitted to buy in to balance `excess' sales, this power will be `narrowly defined'. Wool International will not be involved in price support or day to day buying activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This `narrow definition' needs defining . . . Wool International will be a commercially-orientated organisation with a clear charter to reduce the industry debt&mdash;yet still not allowed to sell more than 33KT per quarter. It hardly makes sense.</PARA>
<PARA>As Malcolm Fraser points out, selling a certain fixed quantity of wool every month for the next three to four years, regardless of market circumstances in Australia and overseas, is an abdication of commonsense and a denial of the exercise of judgment which is very hard to comprehend. The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association has expressed concern at the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . excessive control of the Government and the Minister of the day and the lack of opportunity for those operating in the industry to determine its future.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the association's major concerns is the board structure and the selection criteria for the boards of Wool International and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. The New South Wales Farmers Association has also expressed concern over this issue. The TFGA has suggested the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is essential that beside the Chairperson there must be two persons on the Board of AWRAP with woolgrowing expertise . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bills be amended to provide for a selection committee process for the Boards, especially the Board of AWRAP . . . these bodies are grower funded and woolgrowers are seriously disenfranchised.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a need for balance. This matter has partially been addressed by the amendments to the Wool International Bill proposed by the government or perhaps pushed by my colleague the shadow minister, the honourable member for Gwydir, Mr Anderson, who has contributed significantly to this overall debate. I pay tribute to his work, particularly in discussing the issue with so many farmers all around Australia. My congratulations to Mr Anderson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to part 5 require the minister for trade to take into consideration nominations by a selection committee in making appointments to Wool International and the procedure for the establishment and operation of a selection committee. Also, proposed amendments to part 6 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993 require the minister to take into consideration nominations by a selection committee in making appointments to AWRAP and to establish a procedure for the establishment and operation of the selection committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if these amendments are successful, growers and the trade will not have knowledge of wool sold and still held in the stockpile by Wool International. This cannot give certainty to the wool industry. The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association was also concerned that there be continuing consultation between AWRAP and growers in the future and for Wool International to consult with the WCA during its period as a statutory body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government introduced a number of amendments to the bill whilst it was in the House of Representatives. The proposed insertion of clause 10A authorises Wool International to consult with organisations representative of different sectors of the wool industry, including the Wool Council. Proposed clause 10A of part 3 of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993 provides for a consultation by AWRAP with the Wool Council before giving corporate plans to the minister. Processors are fed up with the chaos created through constant change in government policies. They fear that the acceleration of stockpile sales would have a devastating effect on prices and push too many growers out of the market. The IWTO has said that a fixed quantity disposal policy is both bad marketing and bad debt management. </PARA>

I ask the minister to consider the issues I have raised in this important debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because I think the issues in the bills and the main points behind them have been well covered. I wish to make a few comments in fairly general terms. I do not oppose the legislation; I am part of the organisation that has agreed to accept it. However, I am not keen on it because I do not think the legislation was framed with a view to trying to resolve the problems of the farmers. It was framed to try to get the government off the hook, and it does that satisfactorily. If it takes the government off the hook, there is no alternative than to believe that it puts the industry back on that same hook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I talk about the industry I mean the whole industry, from the people who grow the wool to the people who ultimately wear it. One of the problems we have suffered in Australia for many years is that the group who publicly consider themselves to be the industry&mdash;the growing part of it&mdash;are not doing justice to the people who look for the customers, do the manufacturing, get the product out, get the best price the market can stand, and so on. Greater consideration has to be given to the fact that we are all in this together. Whether they are fine producers, coarse producers or superfine producers, whether they are in knitwear or growing, whether they are scourers or weavers or shearers or breeders makes no difference. It is one industry from top to bottom, and the success or failure of any one of those sectors impinges on every other sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this has been one of the great weaknesses. Not long after I came into this place, I spoke on a wool bill and referred to the work being done by the processors. I was invited to the headquarters of the Wool Corporation for lunch. I thought it was very nice of them, as I had spoken on the wool bill only once at that stage. But I was called to the Wool Corporation to get a smack across the knuckles for having dared to give some credit to the wool manufacturers. I was told that Australia did not want or need a wool manufacturing industry; that it was our job to grow the wool and other people's jobs to manufacture it; and that I would be much more help to the industry if I ceased giving support to the processors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that did was encourage me to support the wool processors even more than I had in the past. I have supported them ever since and I will continue to do so while I am here and beyond. I believe that Australia has a tremendous potential. It is commonsense that we should improve our processing sector. We should give every encouragement possible to people who are prepared to add value to this great product. Not enough has been done in the past, and I cannot see that anything in this legislation will do anything to encourage greater on-processing than we have been able to get in the past. We have had these differences between the various sectors blown up in a way that tries to pass the responsibility or the blame from one to the other. Every time we do that, the whole of the wool process from start to finish suffers, and that achieves nothing for anybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate over the time I have been here, since 1975, to have spent a lot of time with the wool industry. It was a hot subject in 1976 and since then it has always been on the agenda. We have interviewed many people here and all over Australia. I have been fortunate to see the processing industry in different parts of the world. I have seen it in the United Kingdom, mainland Europe, North America, Taiwan, China, Japan, New Zealand and Australia. I suppose I have seen most of the wool manufacturing plants in Australia and a good few in other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have any God-given right to produce wool, but we do have an incentive to use it and to see that others use it. However, it has to be demand driven. There has not been nearly enough concentration on seeing that we get the marketing and processing of wool in better shape. Right now we must get more wool into use. There is no point in doing a silly thing like stacking it up in sheds and pretending that it is not there, as we have done in recent years. We have to get it out and get it in use. We have to do more research, and still more research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For goodness sake, let us not allow this present kerfuffle to restrict the research we are doing, or the research we have done in the past. We know what the pros and cons of wool are; we know the things the customer likes and dislikes. We are still not doing enough to remove the things that are causing difficulties with the marketing of wool. We have to do more in those directions. We have to work cooperatively with the growers, the processors and the customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have discussed with buyers for some of the major retail chains in the world why they buy or do not buy wool. I have discussed with manufacturers the proportions of wool they use in their blends. I have discussed whether the proportions go up or down, and whether that depends on price, availability or what. I am concerned that the marketers of wool in Australia are not getting their wool close enough, early enough, to where the users are. It is all very well to have wool in the shed in Australia, but if the marketer happens to be in Northern Ireland or Czechoslovakia it is not much use to that marketer if he has to pay for it two months in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be more concerned about how we supply the needs of the people who want the wool. We have markets for hand knitted wool jumpers in Japan; we have markets for machine knitted jumpers in Switzerland and places like that. We have to look at every little niche that we can and encourage every producer to be more conversant with the market. We have been through a patch where for over 40 years the people who produced the wool had no idea. They had very little interest in what was happening, and that is not good enough. We must have the producer ready to take over and see that he is growing what the customer wants and marketing it in the form that he wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not care how the customers want it. If the customers want it done up with blue string, they can have it with blue string. If they want it in plastic bags, they can have it in plastic bags&mdash;anything at all. They are the customers. For too long we have decided that we did not really need the customer, that we were producing the miracle fibre. It is no miracle fibre to anybody down the line unless we make it so and unless it is delivered the way the customer wants it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report will not fix anything in itself, but it does show the way that things can happen. All I can do is appeal to the various sections of the industry to work together, to cooperate more, and to regard the customer as the ultimate. If we do that, we still have time to make the wool industry the sort of industry that we would like to think it is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in the matters of public interest debate to bring to the attention of the Senate a very serious matter in relation to the impact on the Australian pulp and paper industry of imported uncoated wood-free white paper, generally referred to as A4 copy paper. My concern is that it would appear that this product is being imported in a climate which affords unfair advantage to overseas producers and which places an unfair burden on local producers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfair advantage I refer to arises out of a combination of factors. The first of these is that major importing countries such as Indonesia and Brazil benefit in the form of reduced tariffs from their developing country status in the Australian market, when at the same time the tariff is being progressively reduced to only five per cent by 1996. Direct subsidies by overseas governments to the paper making industries to assist exports are coupled with high tariffs protecting their domestic markets from imports, including imports from Australia. They also have less stringent environmental and labour force protection requirements. These factors combine to aggravate deliberate, aggressive marketing strategies, in effect dumping white copy paper in Australia to the detriment of local producers already suffering from the Australian and worldwide economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of this house are aware, I have long advocated the use of our natural resources in a manner which strives for ecological and economic sustainability and which maximises adding value to our raw resources&mdash;in this case, quality paper coming from our forests. Although in terms of action there is still a long way to go, it is fair to say that the states, the federal government and the forest based industries have come a considerable way in Australia in recent times in recognising the imperatives and the advantages of an ecologically and economically sustainable approach in the development of a national forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this, as encouraged by the federal government, the pulp and paper making companies have undergone extensive restructuring and rationalisation to become internationally competitive. In the case of APM this was effected by cooperation and negotiation with unions which accepted considerable job losses in the interests of the long-term viability of the industry. APPM unfortunately took a less cooperative path. It is untenable that these gains&mdash;largely at the expense of workers' jobs, but also through workplace reform management practices, multiskilling and improved health and safety results&mdash;are now being eroded by unfair competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that due to the combination of factors I have outlined this whole shift to more efficient production, more effective resource use and more environmentally friendly practices is being greatly jeopardised. Over the next few minutes I will expand on these factors one at a time. However, first I would like to bring it to the attention of the Senate that imports of white A4 copy paper have been the subject of a recent dumping inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preliminary finding by the Australian Customs Service was that the Australian industry had suffered material injury caused by dumped imports of A4 copy paper from Brazil, Finland, Germany, Indonesia, South Africa and the USA. Pending final recommendations from the Anti-Dumping Authority, provisional anti-dumping measures were due to be imposed from 16 September 1993. These provisional measures are in the form of penalties to import companies, and are likely to be sufficient to prevent further dumped imports except in the case of Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Indonesia, there is some concern that the information customs officers were able to collect was insufficient to make an accurate base calculation from which to assess the dumping margin. In addition, there has been considerable lobbying, such that the imposed penalty has been adjusted several times. It has been indicated by the Indonesian government that the penalties will be totally absorbed without changing the selling price. This will lead to a ridiculous situation whereby penalties imposed to overcome dumping actually increase the relative price advantage of one of the offenders. It has been put to me that there is a strong case for the Anti-Dumping Authority to undertake a fresh investigation with respect to Indonesia. I concur with that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the factors that I outlined earlier. I raise in the first instance the matter of developing country preferences. The purpose of this scheme is to provide a margin of preference to internationally classified developing countries in the Australian market. Amendments in February this year removed the developing country preferences for a number of Australian industries&mdash;for example, clothing, textiles and footwear, chemicals et cetera&mdash;in all but the least developed countries. Pulp and paper were not removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is contended by those who argue that they should be removed, that the pulp and paper industries in countries that benefit from developing country preferences&mdash;in particular, Brazil and Indonesia&mdash;are far from developing industries and by world standards are large, technologically sophisticated, and heavily capital-intensive. They are, in fact, highly competitive by international standards. In 1992, Indonesia accounted for more than 60 per cent of the paper and board production of the South-East Asian region, including Australia. Given that Indonesia and Brazil currently hold a significant share of the Australian uncoated, wood-free paper market&mdash;in the case of A4 copy paper, over 70 per cent&mdash;I tend to agree that the matter of the pulp and paper industry and developing country preference needs to be urgently reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that these overseas, large-scale operations enjoy considerable support from their governments in the form of subsidies, export incentives and tariff protection. As an illustration of the disparity on tariff alone, the tariff for A4 cut size copy paper from Indonesia to Australia is seven per cent. As it benefits from developing country preference, it has a 42 per cent cost advantage over other, non-privileged importers. In fact, Indonesia imposes an effective 45 per cent barrier on paper imports. Australia is the only country in the Asian region which has adopted a policy of zero tariffs. If Australian industry is to rise to the challenge that this policy imposes it cannot, at the same time, contend with dumped imports that undermine market share, and thus the ability to make necessary improvements or reinvest in local expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious concern. Not only does this have economic impacts, but I suggest it has grave environmental and social impacts, both within Australia and in the exporting countries. In conditions of unfair competition, as stated, 700 jobs are directly at risk. In addition, many times that number in indirectly related jobs, and jobs from future expansion of the industry, are at risk. In terms of our foreign debt, expansion in this industry is very desirable. In 1991-92, imports of printing and writing paper totalled in excess of 490,000 tonnes with a free on board value of $670 million. The free on board cost excludes freight and insurance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing dumping of copying paper also has implications for our ability to increase the recycled content of our paper used in Australia. Of further concern is the environmentally damaging harvesting methods of countries such as Indonesia and Brazil. Critics have raised issues such as rainforest removal, social dislocation, loss of native flora and fauna, erosion and water pollution. These practices are coming under some pressure for change, but the less stringent environmental regulations currently afford further cost advantages. Similarly, exploitation of the indigenous work force means that wages are low and conditions are poor. By not acting to ensure paper products are not dumped in Australia, we are not only failing to protect our own economic, social and environmental interests, but failing to perform our international, environmental and social responsibilities as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, if we were to take the actions I have outlined, I believe they would remove any remaining excuses that forest based industries have for not investing in paper making facilities in Australia, rather than seeking to expand exporting of woodchips. Instead of unions, environmentalists and large sections of the community opposing a proposed enormous woodchip mill in north-west Tasmania, all of those forces could positively combine to urge the company concerned to invest in a paper mill using less natural resources while producing more jobs and wealth for Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week, on Wednesday evening, there was a fire on Beecroft Peninsula at Jervis Bay. It appears the fire started at about 8 p.m. when a so-called `star shell' from HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Derwent</EMPHASIS> lobbed into bushland at Honeymoon Bay, a tiny and beautiful inlet on the eastern shoreline of Jervis Bay. An area of heathland measuring a little under one square kilometre was burnt out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beecroft Peninsula defines the north-west side of Jervis Bay. It is an area of substantial beauty and ecological value. It is also of great importance to the Jerringa people who live nearby and who have retained strong links with the area. Beecroft is rich with the relics of their ancestors, and has many sites of continuing spiritual significance to them. But Beecroft is also a defence area. About 10 per cent of the peninsula is a gunnery range which is regularly bombarded during naval and air force exercises. The remainder is used from time to time for army exercises in which such things as amphibious landings are practised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week's fire was the result of a naval bombardment which went wrong. In fact, the star shell appears to have landed between three and four kilometres from the boundary of the impact zone. It is extraordinary that such a huge error was made. There is no official word on the damage that was done by this fire; although, we do know that new bushfire control tracks were hastily created to help put the fire out. We may never know the impact on the birds and animals in the area because a comprehensive fauna survey has never been conducted. It is likely that the burnt out area is a home for rare bird species, particularly the eastern bristlebird, which is the most endangered bird on the Australian mainland. There may also be endangered animals living there, but no-one knows for certain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fire could have been much worse. Had it occurred in summer, it could have affected a far greater area, like the January 1991 fire which destroyed 12 square kilometres. Had the wind been blowing in a different direction, it would have swept through areas which are of great significance to the Jerringa people. I am not suggesting that this fire was in itself a major disaster but it could have been. Furthermore, it is not an isolated incident; unplanned fires caused by naval bombardment have become an annual event. I have already mentioned the huge fire of January 1991. In December last year, about two square kilometres were burnt out when a navy target flare set fire to bushland during a period of high fire danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1991, major environmental damage was caused by an army exercise called Operation Termite Spray. Army trucks removed sand from a beach; new tracks were bulldozed; trees were cut down; an Aboriginal midden at Honeymoon Bay was removed to make way for a shower/laundry complex; seagrass meadows were destroyed; and tracked vehicles were driven through wetlands of ecological significance. My colleague Senator Coulter had a lot to say about this at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some local defence people have tried to excuse the accidental fires by claiming that the area's ecology is fire dependent anyway. I will respond by making two points. First, fire dependent areas will only retain their value where firing takes place under an ecologically based fire management plan; where fires are timed to cause maximum benefit and minimum damage; where the area to be burned and the rate of burning are controlled; and where firefighters are on hand before a fire is lit. Random unplanned fires which require an emergency response are not the way to manage such an area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, there are vegetation communities and endangered species on Beecroft which, if destroyed by fire, will not recover. There is a patch of remnant rainforest on the peninsula which is testimony to that fact. There used to be more rainforest on Beecroft Peninsula, but much has been lost through fire. I have a copy of a map of Beecroft which dates back to the 1960s and was produced by the Currarong Bowling and Recreation Club. There is a note on the map which laments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the wholesale destruction by bushfires, numbers of which occurred between December 1942 and December 1946. Most, if not all of these were deliberately started by persons . . . or their agents . . . interested in obstructing the campaign for public parklands. Probably the greatest loss was the rainforest belt of Bindijine Heights and lower Duck Creek, and the flowering heathland [around] Currarong village. These things never can be replaced.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week's fire left local people asking whether history is repeating itself. Because of the frequencies of fires and damaging exercises, they are becoming convinced that Defence is deliberately degrading the area, with the aim of undermining the campaign to include Beecroft Peninsula in a Jervis Bay national park and marine reserve. I should make it clear that I have no reason to believe that the recent fires were deliberately lit, but I do ask whether the tempo of Defence activities on Beecroft has been raised to underline its control over the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, Defence's use of Beecroft Peninsula is becoming increasingly inappropriate. The local Aboriginal communities, including the Wreck Bay people on the south side of Jervis Bay, have bitter memories of being driven from Beecroft by navy bombardment. It is an affront to the reconciliation process to continue the same offensive activities in the 1990s. It is an affront to the unique ecology and beauty of the area to continue to use it for military target practice. It is even more offensive that not only is the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) stepping up these activities but he is also pushing for the proposed east coast armament complex to be located at Jervis Bay, with Beecroft Peninsula earmarked as the site for the armament wharf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats fervently hope that cabinet will make the minister see sense on this issue and strike Jervis Bay off the list of possible ECAC sites. That would remove a major obstacle which is preventing the resolution of the Jerringa people's land claim. It has also stalled the establishment of a national park and marine reserve. At present, there is a short list of four possible ECAC sites&mdash;Jervis Bay, Twofold Bay near Eden, Point Wilson north of Geelong and Port Curtis near Gladstone. Senator Ray has stated his intention to reduce the list to two sites and to subject them to separate environmental impact statements before making the final choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that Senator Ray intends to make Jervis Bay one of these sites. There are rumours doing the rounds that the other one will be Twofold Bay. If that is the minister's plan, then it is a transparent attempt to give cabinet no choice but to select Jervis Bay as the ECAC site. As the minister knows from the recent interdepartmental committee which examined the ECAC alternatives, Twofold Bay is out of the question unless the Harris-Daishowa woodchip mill closes down in the very near future. As much as the Democrats might welcome such a development, we cannot see it happening in the near future, and I am sure the minister shares that view. A choice between Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay seems to us to be no choice at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the minister's plan for two separate EISs on two sites is fundamentally flawed. Two independent studies will not allow the two sites to be compared and the best site identified. That can only be done by an integrated assessment. The Democrats favour an inquiry under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. We believe that the inquiry should be conducted by a three-member panel: a chairperson skilled at public consultation, one member with environmental expertise and another with a background in defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the inquiry should take a long, hard look at the merits of Port Curtis, particularly given that it could be an excellent long-term home for the east coast fleet. We believe it should also consider Port Wilson, but only with the strict condition that an ECAC at that site should not obstruct the relocation of Melbourne's Coode Island chemical storage facility away from urban areas. It should examine Twofold Bay, although, as I have said before, the prospects of an ECAC at that site do not look good. It should also have the scope to examine other sites and other proposals such as the Australian Conservation Foundation's suggestion of a purpose-built armaments facility. But Jervis Bay should be struck off the short list. It is time to recognise the unique beauty, ecology and heritage of the area and to provide the protection which is long overdue. The minister is right to point out that past occupation by Defence has saved Jervis Bay from&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about air safety in Australia today because I have got some real concerns about it. The fact is that the assurance of safety has been degraded by the actions of the Civil Aviation Authority in recent years. I am not saying that there are no safety procedures left in aviation. I am saying that the procedures and the practices, which provided a cushion for air safety operations in Australia, have been greatly reduced by the activities of the CAA in recent years. That is a tragedy: the primary role of the CAA&mdash;in fact the only reason that the CAA exists&mdash;is to provide safe air navigation within Australia. The drift that we have seen simply cannot be tolerated any longer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the last week, we have seen reports of two very distressing accidents where a large number of lives have been lost. The first report relates to a Monarch Air Services flight flying into Young. The other report relates to two young Australians who lost their lives on a flight between Sydney and Forbes. Both of them relate to bad weather but, beyond that, there are great differences in the operations of the two flights. I will come to the Monarch flight at a future date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal today with the loss of the two young Australians on that flight to Forbes. I believe it is a reasonable proposition that, since they survived the crash, they might well have been alive today if they had been found promptly. I stress that I do not know their condition after the crash&mdash;how badly injured they were&mdash;and it may well have been so bad that, even if they been picked up by a helicopter immediately afterwards, they would not have survived. But the general proposition is that, if someone survives an aviation accident, and if they can be found in time and get medical attention, there is a good possibility that they will survive. There is a tragic parallel here with the Stinson crash in the late 1930s on the Lamington Plateau. Again, you had bad weather and high ground. In the case of the Stinson, two did survive the crash but there was a very long delay in finding them. Surely we have learnt something, in nearly 60 years of aviation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question to the Civil Aviation Authority is this: why was a flight plan not put in for that flight? The answer to that question is quite simple. People do not fly on flight plans today because it is too impractical to file one. The majority of people flying in Australia today are private VFR operators, which is what this pilot was. It is very easy for an airline captain, or an air force pilot or a charter operator to file a plan. Further, they are obliged to do so by law. However, private pilots are actively discouraged by the Civil Aviation Authority in filing a flight plan. They are told it costs the system $150 to file a plan. I find that a nonsensical statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA must have looked at its bloated overheads, divided it by the number of operations that it can identify that it performs and come up with this figure. If it costs the CAA $150 to file a flight plan from me, it really ought to be shut down and put out of business. I reckon I could do it for no more than a dollar. But this is all part of the doctrine of affordable safety that Australian aviation is now suffering under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two days after this aircraft was lost, one of the papers reported that over 50 aircraft&mdash;fixed-wing and rotary wing&mdash;were involved in a search that extended over 40,000 square kilometres. How many years of filing flight plans would equal the cost of that search? And that was only the first two days of the search! It is one of dozens of searches that take place each year in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great majority of pilots who fly in Australia fly in the category `private VFR'. Most of them spend their time flying in the circuit; they just do not have the money, with the huge cost of aviation today, to fly cross-country very frequently, and it is when they go cross-country that they get into trouble. They get into trouble because the CAA has changed all the air traffic control procedures, and has not had an effective education scheme to educate pilots about what the new procedures are. What the CAA is trying to do has my full support. I think that what it is trying to do is laudable, but the way it is going about it is absolutely horrendous. The way it has managed changes to the air traffic procedures in Australia is absolutely incompetent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have told generations of pilots that first of all they should get the weather information&mdash;and it is self-evident why one should get weather information before one flies long distances&mdash;and, secondly, that they should file a flight plan so that someone knows where they have gone. There are lots of benefits from filing a flight plan. First of all, one sits down and works out whether one can actually get to where one wants to go with the winds there are, and whether one has enough fuel on board. That is a very effective discipline in itself. It guarantees to some degree that the flight can be operated safely. The second thing is that if someone files a flight plan, it is a discipline on him to follow the tracks that he has put on paper. If he does not file a flight plan and he is flying from here to Parkes or Dubbo, he really is under no compulsion to follow a straight line or a predictable course because there is no reason to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the CAA started these changes, in every airfield that had a manned tower, a pilot could walk in and get the weather, or could phone that tower and get the weather. A pilot could walk in and file a flight plan or could phone the tower there and lodge a plan. Most importantly, he could talk to a briefing officer. He could say, `I have not been into Rockhampton for 12 months. I want to fly from Archerfield to Rockhampton and I am going to go into Bundaberg for fuel. What do I need to know?'. In 30 seconds the briefing officer would say, `Your frequencies are so and so, call here and call there'. Not only would he be safe, but all other users of the airspace would be safe as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowadays, the system is totally different. I cannot go to an airfield in Australia and get the weather. I have got to have a PIN number, and I have got to have a fax machine. I have got the facility to phone for the weather information, but if I do that I will be talking to one operator dealing with a large part of the country, and I might wait for a very long while before I get through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same applies for flight plans. I have got to file with a fax machine. If I am travelling around Australia, perhaps staying in a motel out in a place like Forbes, I cannot communicate that way. Most of those places do not have fax machines. If I want to phone in I have difficulties, because the access is limited to one or two operators. If I try to do it by radio, I run into the problem that the CAA actively discourages people from filing a plan. I think that is totally unacceptable. People in the private VFR category now are not telling other people what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to add to that the great changes that have taken place in air traffic control procedures. We have MTAFs and CTAFs and airways clearance procedures have been changed, and changed dramatically. And remember what I said before: a pilot can no longer go to a briefing officer at an airfield and be told what the changes are. He cannot even get a reference document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the CAA messed all this up, we all had visual flight guides. A VFG was a simple book which, in plain language, dealt with every aspect of VFR flying in Australia. If a pilot could not talk to anyone, he could open the book up and be quite safe and be quite precise in what he was doing. The CAA got rid of the VFG. Somehow or other it just was not politically correct in the affordable safety, user pays doctrine that now governs the CAA. The authority issued instead RACOPS and the AIP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been flying for 30 years, so I think I know a little bit about VFR operations, and I find both documents absolutely useless and incomprehensible. They do not tell me what I need to know to operate safely around the country. I will give a simple point on that. If I look up the index of one of these publications I find that it says `Documents to be carried in the aircraft in flight'. I turn to the relevant page and the relevant paragraph, and under `Documents to be carried in flight' I find `see Civil Aviation Order such and such'. That does not help me in any way at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to all of this is the fact that the user-pays doctrine has put quite a heavy premium on documents supplied inefficiently by the CAA. Most private pilots do not bother. I would be one of the few people around the place who pays $100 or more a year to keep up-to-date with documents, the great majority of which I never use and am unlikely to use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the cultural change in the CAA itself. The aviation community, compared to other sectors of the community, is an above average and conscientious group of people. Their education levels, by the very nature of their occupation&mdash;whether they are maintaining aircraft or flying them&mdash;are above the community average. They are people who conscientiously want to conform and do the right thing. There are always a few bad eggs, but they stand out because the aviation community is so small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time the department of civil aviation worked in cooperation with the industry. It led by example, it counselled people and it advised them. We now have in Australia a totally aggressive CAA which will take people to court at the drop of a hat, fine them thousands of dollars for trivial things, pick on the weak and the harmless, and never go after the bad eggs that are around the place because they are too difficult to take to court. We have this openly aggressive situation now between the aviation community and the CAA which is totally antipathetic to good relations and safe operations. There is no reason for that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am astonished at the number of people who fly around Australia and who, in response to air traffic control inquiries, glibly give false call signs. They might say, `This is Bravo Alpha Whisky' when they are `Sierra Alpha November' or something. I got a bill for operations in Cairns and I had never been remotely near the area. The call sign of my aeroplane was given by someone else. I am incredulous that pilots in large numbers are using false call signs around Australia. It was absolutely unheard of a few years ago. The reason they are doing it is that they do not want any contact with the CAA at all. One opens journals like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AOPA</EMPHASIS> and finds correspondence there from honourable, respectable solicitors advising members of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AOPA</EMPHASIS> to have no contact with the CAA at all, to `maintain silence if they talk to you'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to have a radical change in the way these things are done. Where we have fields with manned towers we have to have an easy and practical facility to be able to get a weather forecast and lodge flight plan; you need someone to talk to. At the same time, accessible phone links have to be established&mdash;not one person dealing with half the country&mdash;so that people can phone in or radio in for this information and file this information when they need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly need a cooperative approach from the Civil Aviation Authority. We need a total revolution of the culture that Senator Collins has introduced and implanted in this society. We have to get a civil aviation authority that wants to work with, not against, the aviation industry. The nonsense that is going on today has to stop and it has to stop rapidly, otherwise a lot of people will die needlessly in the VFR field in Australia. </PARA>

The column `Inside Sydney' reported on a telephone conversation between the republican move-ment's chief tout, Malcolm Turnbull, and the monarchists' executive director, Tony Abbott. The article reported a complaint from Mr Turnbull that Mr Abbott was seriously misquoting him. The detail of the alleged misquotation was based on Mr Turnbull's view of codification of the reserve powers. `Inside Sydney' reported that Mr Abbott denied that he had misquoted Mr Turnbull.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is typical of the modus operandi of a bullying oaf.

Turnbull is only matched in his arrogance by his present&mdash;and I am sure temporary&mdash;friend, the Prime Minister. Mr Turnbull has the capacity to fall out with almost everybody. Bullying seems to have become the hallmark of the republican movement, especially now that its supporters appear unable to persuade us by rational argument. Whatever the misguided sincerity of many republicans, there is a bit of Brownshirt in Mr Turnbull. The republican movement has failed to convince us why a republic is preferable, what changes are necessary and how it will be achieved. So now it will get nasty. </PARA>

Republicans infer Australians are not clever enough to understand their proposals. It is just that we are a wake up to Mr Turnbull. Turnbull said some time ago that the argument about whether we have a republic is over. He said that we are now only arguing about the form it will take. What arrogant nonsense.

Mr Keating is a great divider and, on constitutional reform, one cannot be that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of very important conferences coming up for consideration in 1994 relating to population and development. In readiness for these conferences, it is important that Australia considers the population debate, particularly in the context of the reproductive rights of women.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just received the suggested guidelines from the United Nations on how a developed country should prepare its national report on population.

I hope that the committee will go beyond the very narrow guidelines that have been presented by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just point out that it is a very bland coverage of the issues. The heading of point I is `The Demographic Context' and the following headings are `The Population Policy and Programme Framework', `International Cooperation in Population'&mdash;that is a very topical issue at the moment&mdash;and `Summary and Conclusions'. There is emphasis on maternal and child health, family planning service delivery and a related maternity benefits program. There is the role and relevance of the world population plan of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Try as I would, however, I could not find very much reference to the role of women in the preparation of the report as far as the United Nations guidelines were concerned. They do appear at page 3, where it is stated that an appropriate global strategy and plan of action for population for the early part of the twenty-first century can only be formulated with active participation and thoughtful contributions from all concerned&mdash;governments, communities, non-government organisations, scholars, individuals, men and, as we might have guessed, women. In all this documentation, that was the only reference that I could find to women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That contrasts with a very important document that I can only very briefly summarise this afternoon. It was prepared in New York and presented on 1 June. It is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's Voices `94: Women's Declaration on Population Policies</EMPHASIS>. I believe that this document is much more central to many of the issues that should be being examined in preparation of Australia's population report. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Population policies and programs of most countries and international agencies have been driven more by demographic goals than by quality of life goals. Population size and growth have often been blamed inappropriately as the exclusive or primary causes of problems such as global environmental degradation and poverty. Fertility control programs have prevailed as solutions when poverty and inequity are root causes that need to be addressed. Population policies and programs have typically targeted low income countries and groups, often reflecting racial and class biases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very relevant issue for Australia to consider in the preparation of its national response, particularly as we have the opportunity to play a significant role in regard to increasing our funding as part of our aid program. Contrary to some of the media and, indeed, opposition speculation, I am assured by Minister Bilney that there is an absolute commitment. However, we believe that we should be open-minded and we should consider other issues, as is reflected in this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women's behaviour rather than men's has been the focus of attention. Women have been expected to carry most the responsibility and risks of birth control, but have been largely excluded from decision-making in personal relationships as well as in public policy. Sexuality and gender-based power inequities have been largely ignored, and sometimes even strengthened, by population and family planning programs.</PARA>
<PARA>However, as women are involved directly in the organisation of services, research and advocacy, we should focus on the issue of women's reproductive health and rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to detail the fundamental ethical principles that women would like to see reflected in all countries' responses in readiness for the population conference in Cairo. I have every confidence that these priorities will be reflected in Australia's population report. In fact, I am hoping that there will be a chapter solely devoted to the issue of women's reproductive health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental ethical principles read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Women can and do make responsible decisions for themselves, their families, their communities, and, increasingly, for the state of the world. Women must be subjects, not objects, of any development policy, and especially of population policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Women have the right to determine when, whether, why, with whom, and how to express their sexuality. Population policies must be based on the principle of respect for the sexual and bodily integrity of girls and women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Women have the individual right and the social responsibility to decide whether, how and when to have children and how many to have; no woman can be compelled to bear a child or be prevented from doing so against her will. All women, regardless of age, marital status, or other social conditions have a right to information and services necessary to exercise their reproductive rights and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>In this country, there are still women who do not necessarily have access to that vital information by virtue of where they live and&mdash;with every respect to you in the chair, Senator Herron&mdash;because some medical practitioners in this day and age in 1993 are still reluctant to give women the necessary advice, information and assistance they need in order to control their own fertility. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. Men also have a personal and social responsibility for their own sexual behaviour and fertility and for the effects of that behaviour on their partners' and their children's health and well-being.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. Sexual and social relationships between women and men must be governed by principles of equity, non-coercion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a point that I am sure Senator Harradine would agree with me on even though he may not necessarily agree with other issues I am raising; non-coercion is absolutely fundamental to women's reproductive rights&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and mutual respect and responsibility. Violence against girls and women, their subjugation or exploitation, and other harmful practices such as genital mutilation or unnecessary medical procedures, violate basic human rights. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.The fundamental sexual and reproductive rights of women cannot be subordinated, against a woman's will, to the interests of partners, family members, ethnic groups, religious institutions, health providers, researchers, policy makers, the state or any other actors.</PARA>
<PARA>The final point I wish to raise today reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Women committed to promoting women's reproductive health and rights, and linked to the women to be served, must be included as policy makers and program implementors in all aspects of decision-making including definition of ethical standards, technology development and distribution, services, and information dissemination.</PARA>
<PARA>I look forward to many of the women in this parliament, many women in the community as well as men who are interested&mdash;as they should be&mdash;in the issue of women's reproductive rights and how this influences population policies and the health of women around the world contributing to a wide ranging and responsible debate on this subject, particularly as we lead to the preparation of Australia's national response and the ongoing debate that I believe will occur in this parliament and in the community, particularly during 1994. </PARA>

An action group which was established in Alice Springs some months ago has been campaigning for a transmitter and indeed for funds to be provided by the government. The amount of money that it is looking for is a miserable $50,000. The group has been fobbed off in all sorts of amazing ways by the minister, to the point where he claimed in this chamber at one stage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the action group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have written a letter to me, and that is as much as I know about it. I have not had a chance to talk to them yet, but I will talk to them. I think there has been a message from my office sent to them&mdash;this only happened last week&mdash;to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what he said back on 29 September. In fact, members of the group had contacted him some three weeks earlier. They had not heard one word from him. The message to which he referred was simply a press release which was faxed to them from Senator Collins, trumpeting his achievement in relation to Darwin. In other words, he was adding insult to injury. Not only would the minister not contact them but he had the cheek to claim that his office had been in touch with a message, which was really just to rub their noses in the dirt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, the action group has tried to contact the minister's office on a number of occasions. On one notable occasion, after this matter had been raised in the Senate and Senator Collins had categorically ruled out any assistance to Alice Springs, his press secretary basically disowned his own minister by saying that Senator Collins really had not meant what he had said. He said, `You know Bob Collins. We are still having a look at it'. The fact of the matter is that they are not looking at it. They have decided against it. Their bottom line, I think, is clearly that they do not want to take any such initiative too far out from the next election. They want to wait until such time as they will get credit and it will be fresh in the minds of the local constituents. In other words, it was a classic political game playing exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that somehow this might open the floodgates, as has been suggested to the action group, is again absolute nonsense. Probably only one or two towns the size of Katherine would be next in the queue. I trust that the minister has seen the quotation which has been provided from Farmer Electronics, which I think pares back the costs to the bone. It comes in at just under $47,000, a very small asking fee, I would have thought. The extraordinary thing is that the minister has not even been prepared to offer to fund on a matching basis. The very least I would have thought he would have done, if he was interested in providing assistance, was to provide it on that sort of dollar-for-dollar basis. Therefore, I think the action group is entitled to be outraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the minister's comments were quite misleading, in any event. To suggest that they were proposing a low-powered transmitter facility which is just going to broadcast to the immediate local area with some sort of a signal completely understates the fact that what they have in mind is a total radiated power from the proposed transmission of 380 watts, as opposed to the present 250 watts from ABC and Imparja. We are not arguing over whether this is feasible, whether it is technically desirable or whether it is possible. The fact is that the Australian Broadcasting Authority granted the licence on 7 September last. So all the specifications have been approved. There is no technical problem. The South Australian and Northern Territory broadcast engineers have given it the all clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here about a project that is all ready to go, except for the intransigence of the minister who has had no compunction about throwing $5.3 million at his local constituents, but obviously could not give a damn about the citizens of the other major town in the territory. That is why Eric Poole was absolutely right when he called on the minister to stop playing games with territorians and bring SBS to Alice Springs. There is absolutely no good reason why this should not occur; it should occur immediately. Unless the minister wants to have yet another fiasco on his hands, then he ought to get off them and do something in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am at it, there is another issue I want to raise in the area of communications. I think this probably falls more in the bailiwick of the Minister for Communications, Mr Beddall. Here we are. Here we are, always ready for a spar!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now let me deal with Mr Beddall. What Mr Beddall has done in this area&mdash;he has done very little and what he has done has taken him a long time to do&mdash;is that he essentially has a different technology time track in three different areas. There are satellite licences which are currently dead in the water because no-one wants to touch them with a barge pole. Murdoch and Packer walked away from them months ago. There are people out there gold-digging and hoping that someone will desperately buy them out. Quite clearly, this process is going to drag on and on for months and months, and we will not have any satellite services up there in the foreseeable future. In any event, why would anyone in his right mind want to spend $500 million on something when he is likely to be trumped from Asia or likely to be encircled by cable and MDS? So it is quite clear that satellite licence process is going nowhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With MDS we are still awaiting details of the revised tender process, which the minister said would be forthcoming within three months&mdash;he said that about five months ago. We have had nothing since then except that we keep getting these sorts of leaks: `In a marked change of style the Keating government is considering quick closed bid one-day sales in individual cities to dispose of the remaining MDS pay licences'. Then at the very end it says that, of course, this has not actually gone past the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is an enormous level of frustration within the department if those people are proposing these sorts of revisions of the process. If they have got a concept in mind, why is it that Mr Beddall has not yet approved the redesigned sale process? Why has he not addressed the fundamental issues? Most importantly, of course, why has he not addressed the question of why there could conceivably be three different types of pay television delivered by three different technologies starting up at three different times?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was highlighted this week by a letter of absolute anguish from a local tourist channel operator in Cairns who wrote to Mr Beddall some weeks ago asking why it was that he was not going to be able to start up on MDS because there is no licence process in place. He was told the likelihood is that he will have to wait until at least the start of 1995 before he can get under way. Yet he finds that, not only is there a Canadian company called Paynet which has taken out cables licences, but now another crowd called Rowcom has taken out cable licences as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So? The fact is that these people have got their licences and they can make commercial decisions. But this other poor unfortunate, if he were to be granted an MDS license&mdash;and he has one at the moment for tourist purposes&mdash;would have to pay a $23,000 annual licence fee. Why? We are talking about delivering the same service simply by a different technology. Why should someone get a cable licence for $785, full stop, and the other have to pay $23,000 a year ad infinitum? Why indeed. I would be delighted if the minister, if he has any knowledge of this subject, could explain to me why we need all these separate licences for each service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, as Fred Brenchley quite rightly points out, the department&mdash;presumably aided and abetted by the ministers&mdash;is in the business of drawing this distinction between narrow cast and broadcast, which will again become the classic boundary dispute. We will have jurisdictional arguments time and again and all the flash lawyers will be needed to try to sort it out. Why do we need to have all these separate licences? They are supposed to be national licences, but as soon as one broadcasts a slightly different service in a geographic area one has to have a separate licence. So Rowcom finds that it needs 28 pay television licences, 10 for terrestrial rebroadcast, six for the broadcast of one local cable television service in each area and 12 to allow for the introduction of additional services as the system develops. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does one need this plethora of pieces of paper? Why cannot we simply say, if it is a national licence, `If you are a fit and proper person or if'&mdash;according to the latest suitability test&mdash;`you are a suitable operator, if you meet the minimum requirements, you can have your ticket'? But no, one can have a whole range of tickets if one pays a relatively small amount for each one and gets going with cable. Who knows? If Telecom really got stuck into it, presumably it could get cable on the road within the next 12 to 18 months at the very latest&mdash;</PARA>

The negotiations that will take place will obviously involve a timetable. If they wanted to pay up-front and get it done immediately it could be done in a relatively short space of time. Most importantly, it could be done well before the start of 1995, which is the earliest on the current timetable that one could get an MDS licence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are&mdash;and I will be brief&mdash;that whilst the Broadcasting Services Act provides for potentially different start-up dates for cable, MDS and satellite delivered pay TV services, it is totally inaccurate to say that those companies that have been allocated cable pay TV licences are `free to start a cable channel right away'. Cable delivered services are licensed under section 96 of the act. Whilst there are no timing constraints on the issue of these licences, there is a range of regulatory conditions that apply and a number of quite significant technological and commercial limitations, which include the dependency of a cable service on broadband capacity into homes, which is a labour intensive, time consuming and very expensive exercise; the cost for the roll-out of a hybrid coaxial optical fibre system; and the need for cable operators to obtain program rights, establish studios, subscriber management and retail infrastructure, and undertake marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that licences for services using MDS and cable are issued subject to suitability requirements in a Trade Practices Commission report. The application fee for each licence is $785, with a maximum of $1,570 payable where more than one licence is involved. As Senator Alston said, cable operators will also either have to bear the cost of laying out the cable infrastructure themselves, which is very significant, or have to lease it from a telecommunications carrier, which would have to be struck at a rate that gives the person who lays the cable a commercial return on the layout of that cable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the assertion that has been made that `Telecom is on the verge of making an offer to Paynet to cable Cairns and Townsville' is also totally inaccurate. Telecom has informed me as of yesterday that, even on its most optimistic calculations, significant numbers of households will not be able to be cabled until 1995. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's tax hikes in 1984 &amp; 1986 were rammed through the parliament with the support of the Opposition&mdash;despite their public criticism!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now it's third time lucky. This time (and it's about time) the Opposition parties have decided to oppose some things in fact as well as in rhetoric and the wine tax is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am comforted to know that Democrat Deputy Leader Meg Lees not only succeeded me in the Senate, but has willingly taken over the baton on this issue, and has led the fight against the 1993 tax hike.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of her campaign it is now clear that the proposed wine tax increase will not pass the parliament. Nevertheless the Labor party appears to be unable to accept the clear industry policy arguments on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to see the 20-31 per cent proposal return in future budgets with the Government hoping to wear down the Opposition on this issue as they have done before.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there is a simple way that you can deliver a clear message to the ALP to back off&mdash;a way to tell them to go back to the drawing board and design a Wine Industry policy, not just a Wine Tax policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not yet. I am staggered by a couple of the claims she makes in this letter. Obviously, as well as being very misleading, it is deceptive and ill-conceived. She obviously had no idea how she was going to be let down by her former colleagues in the Senate. Despite what Janine Haines said, Senator Lees has not led the fight against the 1993 tax hike. Senator Haines said that, because of her campaign, it is now clear that the proposed wine tax increase will not pass the parliament. We all know that the Democrats backed off under pressure and gave in for a compromise package which will see the sales tax on wine creep up slowly, but creep up nevertheless. We all know there is no reason why the Democrats could not have chosen to vote with the opposition and defeat the increase in sales tax on wine completely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is obviously what Janine Haines expected the Democrats to do when she wrote her letter to the winegrape growers on 8 October. We can imagine how disappointed, embarrassed and angry she must be that her own colleagues let her down and voted for increased taxes on wine. She says early in her letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the ten years I served in the Senate, the Democrats stood alone in fighting for the Wine Industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I have never heard such an outrageous claim in my life but it does prove one thing: when the Democrats stand alone, they can do nothing. They can do absolutely nothing on their own. If it were not for the fact that the coalition had made a decision that they were going to oppose wine taxes, the Democrats would not have been left with a leg to stand on. It would have been like their previous, much publicised fighting for the wine industry; they could have achieved absolutely nothing at all. It is only with the support of the coalition that they are ever able to do anything; they can do nothing on their own. In this situation we see them back off and back away from their original stance&mdash;the very thing that Janine Haines says they have never done and has accused the opposition of doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Janine Haines also gives the Australian Labor Party a bit of a bucketing&mdash;something that her federal colleagues in the Senate seem very reluctant to do&mdash;saying that the Labor Party appears to be unable to accept the clear industry policy arguments on this issue. Perhaps if former Senator Haines was still leading the Democrats they might have shown a bit more backbone and the wine tax might have been defeated in its entirety. What I thought was most interesting was that the former leader says that winemakers and grape growers can deliver a message to the ALP, in her words, `to back off', by contributing to the Democrats' campaign to replace ALP members of parliament with Democrat MPs in the upcoming South Australian election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She does not make any mention of the Liberal Party of Australia because she really only wants to replace Labor Party members with Democrat members. This, perhaps, gives us some indication that Senator Haines has had a change of heart in many areas and now believes that the only alternative government is the Liberal Party, particularly the Liberal Party in South Australia. Honourable senators would have to ask whether Janine Haines wants the Labor Party out of office in South Australia so badly that she is prepared to tell Democrat supporters that they should be giving all their preferences to the Liberal Party. </PARA>

Concerning the letter that Janine Haines has written to the Winegrape Growers Council, let me come back to the fact that the former leader of the Democrats has been let down badly by her colleagues&mdash;or her former colleagues&mdash;when she says that they will always stand up for the wine industry. They backed off at the last minute. In no way did Senator Lees lead the fight against the 1993 tax hikes. When the budget was announced, within a couple of days the coalition announced, clearly and concisely, those parts of the budget that it intended to oppose. The Democrats thought about it for two or three weeks then decided what their position would be once they knew they had a base to stand on. That base for their opposition was provided by the strong stand that was taken by the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>

Does the minister agree that Mr Hill has clearly defamed the Governor-General?

We are also concerned about the processes that are being jeopardised in relation to independence and costs. This loss of independence is of serious concern.

This means that those who will be most disadvantaged in our community&mdash;here we are talking about the protection of basic human rights&mdash;are the 30 per cent of Victorians who are of non-English speaking backgrounds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important part of the continuing debate about purchasing in Australia and by the Australian government, in particular. We have established a telecommunications group which was proposed in the budget. This is part of the push to ensure that taxpayers' money is spent effectively and responsibly and that the objectives of better value for money are achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first activity of this Commonwealth telecommunications group&mdash;CTG&mdash;was finalised recently with the signing of an agreement with Telecom Australia to provide custom net horizon services to Commonwealth departments and agencies. It is estimated that this will realise savings of about $4 million per year and provide a platform on which further important business solutions for Commonwealth agencies can be developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group is negotiating further agreements with Telecom, Optus and other telecommunications service suppliers. It is an initiative which has broad ramifications for Australian industry. I know this is of interest to Senator Murphy, and he is quite correct to be interested in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth currently spends more than $325 million a year on telecommunications products and services and expects it to increase to $400 million by 1997-98. Therefore, how this money is spent is very important, both in terms of the efficient use of taxpayers' money and in terms of industry development. The CTG provides a central focus for suppliers and the group is working with local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As many senators would be aware, the telecommunications industry is more than just a couple of high profile carriers&mdash;a large number of small to medium size local companies are involved. Some of these companies are at the leading edge of communications technology development and it is important that they get the opportunity to make the maximum contribution. The government intends to maximise the opportunities for local industry participation in this important initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will recall&mdash;how could it forget&mdash;that I announced yesterday the establishment of a task force within my department to review purchasing policy generally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The draft trade related intellectual property rights agreement, or TRIPS agreement, deals with matters of intense interest to both developed and developing countries&mdash;countries of the north and the south. The agreement will help to strengthen the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in trade related activity. It will provide minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property in a wide range of areas, encompassing patents, copyright, trademarks, industrial designs, integrated circuits, geographical indications and trade secrets. Intellectual property protection, through the various means covered in the agreement, will help the growth of technology based industry, in particular, and certainly sharpen the competitive edge of domestic products from countries making them in global markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Better defined and workable global rules for the protection of intellectual property rights will also stimulate innovative economic activity by guaranteeing a financial return to, and a recognition for the creative efforts of, investors, artists, technicians and other innovators. Again, that is true of people in those categories in both developed and developing countries. Certainly, the developing countries have much to gain from a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round, including the TRIPs agreement. That was reflected most recently in the CHOGM declaration, initiated by Prime Minister Keating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the questions about patentability of life forms and the implications of that in this context, in its own patents legislation the Australian government has taken the view that patents are available for inventions in all fields of technology&mdash;both biological and non-biological. I am advised&mdash;there is a marvellous solemnity about this bit of my briefing note&mdash;that human beings and the biological processes for their generation are not in Australia patentable inventions. No doubt it is a matter of profound relief to us all to know that. I can think of some people whose performance one might want to patent, but be that as it may.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no necessary inconsistency&mdash;I hope Senator Coulter would agree&mdash;between the research and commercialisation of particular matters and the reflection of ethical values in the patent system governing that research and commercialisation.

The text does provide members with the flexibility to exclude from patentability inventions which might otherwise, I am told again, challenge public order or morality.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All I can say further is that the specific text of the agreement notes that members may exclude from patentability inventions in order to protect public order or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health. The text does allow countries to exclude from patentability plants and animals, but countries do have to provide some kind of protection for plant varieties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can indicate that there has been an alarming increase this year. That underlines the need for a national immunisation strategy, about which I have been speaking to state health ministers during the last few months. So far this year 1,725 cases of whooping cough have been reported. Not only is that five times the number for the same period last year but it is also more than any number reported in the whole of any one year since records were first kept 15 years ago. Between January and the end of September more than 2,000 cases of measles were reported to the communicable diseases network of Australia. That is three times the number for the same period last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between May and August more than 600 measles cases were reported in Tasmania alone, with 500 notified in western Sydney since the middle of June. Over 40 children have been hospitalised and four of those have been admitted to intensive care. Increases have also been recorded in Queensland, Victoria and the ACT. That, of course, is pretty depressing news but it highlights our need not to be complacent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concern of all of the state ministers about the drop in immunisation rates. I do not know whether it results from one or all of parental complacency, ignorance or just some kind of wilful defiance of all the health warnings. But one thing is for sure: that drop in the immunisation rate is selling out our children's health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measles is a serious and highly infectious childhood disease with one in every 1,000 cases causing serious complications such as pneumonia and inflammation of the brain. Latent complications can lead to deaths many years later. Whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial disease which causes severe bouts of coughing and may last for weeks or even months. It is particularly serious in young children who sometimes need to be hospitalised when they have difficulty in breathing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State health authorities have issued any number of warnings and alerts to parents to ensure that children are immunised on time, specifically against measles and, through the triple antigen shot, against whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hold your horses and curb your hormones; just relax. Those opposite will get an answer to the question. One of the difficulties is that there is a constant reference to not knowing enough about the detail of the proposed legislation. Senator Hill went so far as to claim in this place a couple of weeks ago that there is some sort of conspiracy of silence so far as the original outline document of 2 September was concerned. In that particular document of 2 September, which has not changed in any relevant respect as a result of the later debate, a very detailed set of provisions were laid out as to the way in which claims which were manifestly vexatious, frivolous and unsustainable would not in fact be registered in a way which would allow them to proceed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to paragraph 95 of that document and subsequent provisions which bear directly upon this. The paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a claim for native title has been received, the Judge may determine&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>right at the outset&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that it not be registered if:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g)the claim is vexatious.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a further provision that enables things to be ruled out if native title has been extinguished over the land or any part thereof. There is a further note in paragraph 96 which addresses the question of the means by which that particular issue might be resolved, because that obviously raises slightly more complex questions than the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, of course, conscious of the possibility of frivolous and vexatious claims, and that is one of the reasons that these provisions are very much part of the outline as it has been anticipated. In the Bowen Basin we have a further issue, which has some people excited, about the fact that there is some overlapping of the claims that have been foreshadowed or made at the moment. Obviously, we have not yet got in place this system of registration, but it will need to be addressed in this way. But the overlapping of two claims is really no different from the sorts of disputes about the exact position of boundaries that occur between land-holders or claimants in other litigation context all along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To attempt to deny potential native titleholders the right to be involved in decisions about proposed uses of the land, to attempt to deny them, moreover, the right at the threshold, even to pursue claims in situations where it might well be thought that the case was unsustainable and the result likely to be negative, is, of course, to get us right back to where we were debating this a couple of days ago.

However, after this search, which I referred to yesterday, AMSA was unsuccessful in finding a suitable vessel for charter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of them are sitting quite close to you. I have been approached by a number of senators from both sides of the chamber to clarify some of the issues raised last Thursday night during the debate. I do not intend to do so at this stage, but I have had a paper prepared. With the concurrence of the Senate I will incorporate it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I think that will give all senators an opportunity to examine some of the issues that were involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the proceedings in the Senate on 21 and 22 October, I have further considered my ruling and the matters which were raised in debate, and I have concluded that the ruling was completely correct and appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rationale of the ruling is that a clear majority is required to make an amendment or request to a bill when the bill is first considered, and therefore a clear majority should be required to insist on an amendment or request which has been disagreed to by the House of Representatives. If the majority which was required to make the amendment or request in the first instance is no longer in existence, clearly the amendment or request is lost. Much of the debate was not directed to this fundamental logical proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much attention was given in the debate to the last phrase of section 23 of the Constitution: "when the votes are equal the question shall pass in the negative"; but insufficient attention was given to the first sentence of the section: "Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority of votes". The procedures of the Senate are designed, and should be interpreted, to ensure that positive decisions, such as amending or passing a bill, are made only by a majority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I circulated to party leaders and to independent senators on 18 October, 3 days before the ruling was given, the advice which I had received in anticipation of the situation which eventually arose and the ruling which I proposed to make in that situation. Senators therefore had the opportunity to consider the ruling in advance. There was nothing different about the situation which arose on 21 October which affected the logic of the ruling or which required any change to the ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take this opportunity to respond to the following points which were raised during the debate:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was stated during the debate that my ruling was predicated on both questions, that the requests be pressed and that the requests not be pressed, having been negatived in committee of the whole. On the contrary, the ruling was not predicated on both questions being negatived, but clearly indicated that the conclusion must be the same regardless of which question was put and negatived. The voting on either question indicated that there was no longer a majority in favour of the requests. As I indicated, I gave the ruling on the substantive question of the effect of the committee's votes before the vote had been taken on the second motion in committee, in response to invitations from Senator Evans and in response to canvassing of the issue by Senator Hill and other senators.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference was made to the fact that the passage in Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> which I quoted in my ruling refers to amendments and not requests. I acknowledged this in my ruling. The point is that the statement which is made there must as a matter of logic apply to both requests and amendments. Both require a majority to be carried.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reference was made to the ruling by President Young, also referred to in Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, that if the question that requests not be pressed is negatived the requests are pressed. That ruling, however, clearly refers to a situation in which the motion is negatived by a majority. That result would not be changed if the question were put in the alternative form, that the requests be pressed. As I pointed out in my ruling, with equally divided votes the situation is quite different, and the effect of the Senate's vote cannot be held to depend on which motion is moved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that Mr Arnold is a very powerful and effective advocate for South Australia. I have never been in any doubt about that. It is very bipartisan and honest of Senator Teague to raise this matter. I think it is a noble exercise of bipartisanship to raise this effective advocacy by Mr Arnold on behalf of South Australia in these two matters. Over all the years that I have known the various members of the South Australian government, it has been my experience that they are effective advocates for their state&mdash;even when I disagree with them. Sometimes I find them much too effective advocates for their state and I wish they were not. It is certainly true about Lynn Arnold in his public comments with regard to both these matters. He raised those issues forcefully.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the specifics of Senator Teague's question, the South Australian government, as far as I know, got exactly the same access to the budget process as all the other state governments. But, after the budget, when the matter was public and open for debate, I suspect that no-one would be in any doubt that, on these two matters, the most effective premier on behalf of his state was Lynn Arnold. If we compare his performance on the wine tax with that of Jeff Kennett, John Fahey&mdash;both of whom represent states with a substantial wine industry&mdash;or Richard Court, they were invisible. The evidence which I cite is that which Senator Teague quoted in such an effective and bipartisan manner, and I thank him for it.</PARA>

I again put the question to the minister and I ask him to give a specific answer. Is there any evidence of any effective representation that has been made by the state Labor government in South Australia&mdash;this failed government&mdash;on either the wine tax or the fuel tax? Is there any evidence that the minister can now demonstrate that has been in fact taken into consideration by the Labor government in the way it has punished my state of South Australia?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The advice to backbenchers is that they should give ministers more notice of their questions so that we can edit them, I suppose. I understand that the issues underlying Senator Beahan's question relate to a complaint by the Life Insurance Policy Exchange that some Australian insurance companies may be engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. My attention has been drawn to that complaint. It is a complaint which was directed, as would be appropriate, to the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, in his capacity as the minister responsible for the Trade Practices Commission. In accordance with the normal practice, Mr Gear's office has referred this matter in the standard manner to the Trade Practices Commission and it is being considered by the Trade Practices Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time on 26 October, Senator Campbell asked me a question in relation to which I undertook to obtain further advice as to, first of all, a reported comment by the Treasurer on the size of the possible compensation bill for Mabo regarding validation of title; and, secondly, the question of how compensation payments will be treated for taxation purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the first part, Senator Campbell's question was predicated on the report of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 26 October that the Treasurer had estimated that compensation costs arising from the Mabo decision would be around only $100 million. I am informed that this was a misrepresentation of what the Treasurer actually said, which was along the lines that the total compensation cost was difficult to estimate but was likely to be in the order of hundreds of millions rather than a billion. This was a general statement, heavily qualified, in accord with the views previously expressed by other ministers, including me, and was not drawing on any particular analysis prepared by the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second matter, the question of how the compensation payments will be treated for the purposes of taxation is yet to be considered definitively by the government. Since it is likely to be some time before any compensation for extinguishment or impairment of native title is required to be paid, there will clearly be time for balanced consideration to be given by the government to all relevant issues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 September 1993 I undertook to obtain further advice for Senator Boswell about the impact of native title on the rights of Aboriginal people who reside on land of which they are not the traditional owners. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Special Minister of State (Mr Walker) have provided the following information.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government has consistently made it clear that the existing rights of all title holders will be protected. Furthermore, there is a provision in the Outline of Proposed Legislation on Native Title released by the Government on 2 September 1993, at paragraph 21 (c), which makes it clear that where there are reservations or conditions for the benefit of any person, including any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person, in a grant then any rights and interests protected by that reservation or condition will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court found recently in the Pareroultja case that native title is not extinguished by grants made to Aboriginal people under the Aboriginal Land Rights (NT) Act. It would appear likely that, in general, grants made under laws for the special benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will not have extinguished native title. It is therefore quite possible that native title will continue to exist on at least some DOGIT land in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances where Aboriginal people who are not the native title holders have a right to reside on the land, that right and any other rights flowing from it will be able to be confirmed as a result of the Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As Senator Richardson indicated, the draft terms of reference have now been tabled. This is obviously in response to the resolution of the Senate that there should be an overall review of income and assets tests as the means of assessing eligibility for the pension.

This review is taking place not before time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put on the public record that yesterday I received what I think is a very sad letter from a couple who are both over 80 and live in New South Wales. They expressed their gratitude to me for having pressed the issue and for being instrumental in having an inquiry set up to investigate why the government in part decided to overturn its decision to treat unrealised capital gains as income for the purpose of assessing the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This couple said they were concerned that the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, was to review the matter. All of us in this chamber must be conscious of ensuring that this review does not cause pensioners more concern about the possibility of further uncertainty. It should be made clear that what we are trying to do is make the system as fair as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Mr Baldwin will put to rest any fears that older people have&mdash;especially the people in their 80s and 90s who have written to us&mdash;about being threatened yet again by more changes. I do not know how we can do that, but we should all attempt to make sure that this review does not produce uncertainty and we should give assurances to those older people that as far as possible things can remain predictable for them. We should all do this because a number of older people have expressed concern. The way this couple wrote their letter made me realise that it is all very well for us to talk about reviews but they are on the receiving end and feeling very threatened and vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the government will consult with the Democrats, the Independents and the coalition about those terms of reference. I put on the public record that I have a number of concerns about the terms of reference. I think the objectives of review, which come under dot point two, should be expanded to add `and the treatment of capital gains on shares and managed investments'. Dot point one, dealing with the scope of the review, should be amended to replace the word `retaining' with `maximising' in the line `retaining incentives for self-provision'. Also dot point two should be expanded by adding at the end `in lieu of the decision not to take all pensioners out of the tax system by 1995'. I am not sure that the government will agree to that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further dot point should be added under the scope of the review and should read `the need to increase national savings'. The specialist reference group suggested in the draft terms of reference appears to me to be somewhat Public Service dominated. While the coalition recognises that there should be Public Service involvement with a specialist reference group, the involvement should be minimal. There is no mention in the draft terms of reference as to how the specialist group will be selected. I believe it ought to be selected independently of the minister. The government must have a resolution passed by the Senate within five sitting days which approves the terms of reference and the reporting date or, on the basis of the resolution which was agreed to some weeks ago, the Senate will set up its own independent inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of concern to me is that I wrote to Mr Hill on 29 September&mdash;that is four weeks ago. I complained to him about the conduct of one of his senior political journalists and the way in which she aired very one-sided views on the political process. I have not had the courtesy of a reply. In other words, Mr Hill is too busy to reply to that sort of issue, but he has plenty of time to get out there and make statements which are fundamentally wrong. </PARA>

The Turnbull report is an options paper; it does not contain a simple proposition. Indeed, Turnbull himself has said that there is no such thing as a minimalist position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, could you give Senator Evans a valium to calm him down so we can proceed. There is a clear issue of ethics here. A major political issue now facing the country, raised by Mr Keating, is whether or not we should become a republic. Mr Keating has put this on the agenda. He has spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayers' dollars in promoting this particular political agenda. There is no question that this is a political issue. It is a political issue because of the way Senator Schacht's colleagues and his Prime Minister have behaved. That is the first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that there is clearly a problem when the person who is charged with running the national broadcasting service becomes involved directly in one of the major political debates of the day. If the comments that are published in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> are correct, he has indulged in some rather extremist views, I would have thought. Nonetheless, the person who is running the national broadcasting service is adopting a highly partisan line in relation to a major political issue. Senator Schacht cannot see a question of ethics there and I believe that he cannot see a question of ethics there because he is always blind to ethics. Nothing would be further from his purview than ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that not only is Mr Hill adopting a highly partisan approach from his position of running the national broadcaster, but also he is indulging in a quite unfounded attack on Mr Hayden, the Governor-General. The irony of this position is that it was Mr Hill's national broadcasting service which sought out Mr Hayden, the Governor-General, to appear on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. The ABC promoted extensively the interview with Mr Hayden. Having promoted it extensively, Mr Hill proceeded to bag the Governor-General. I believe his behaviour is quite out of court. It is a great pity that Senator Collins, in his comments today, totally failed to address the very real issues which have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the extremist comments that David Hill makes. He calls this the monarchist position, the greatest manifestation of the Australian cultural cringe, and he says that Australians are not quite good enough and cannot be trusted enough to shape their own destiny. I point out to the Senate that that is an extremist position. It is very clear that Australia has been an independent nation for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Evans were worried about the cultural cringe, if he were worried about Australia having the capacity to control its own destiny, he would not involve Australian domestic disputes in UN committees, and that is what he has done. He has overturned the whole philosophy of the Australia Act. If he really believed in Australia being an independent country, if he really believed that Australia was to control its own destiny, he would not have taken the actions he has taken. If the ABC's David Hill really was concerned about the cultural cringe, he would be concerned about Senator Evans's cultural cringing to the UN on every occasion. If David Hill was concerned about Australia controlling its own destiny, he would be very concerned about the fact that Senator Evans has overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act and he has opened up appeals to UN committees to deal with domestic human rights disputes. </PARA>

Of course, this was her major crime. She first of all suggested, on the basis of a referral from the former Labor government, after a two-year inquiry, that the Fairlea prison should not be closed down because it was discriminatory against women. Some months later she went on to suggest that there were some problems in Victoria as a result of there being a 50 per cent increase in the number of job related complaints to her commission because of changes to the employment laws in that state. What we are seeing is a vindictive, vicious government in action, seeking now to remove her from her position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Labor Party members attack the Kennett government and the restructuring of the Equal Opportunity Commission in Victoria, one thing it is alleged they are most worried about is that this may breach international standards on human rights. These are the independence boys who constantly assert, like the good republicans they all claim to be, that Australia must be independent, and they have signed us up to the UN like no other government in Australian history. As I pointed out to Senator Gareth Evans, and got him very excited a moment ago, they have overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act.

They have shown their willingness to involve us ceaselessly and unthinkingly in UN human rights conventions, to trade off the independence of this country and to allow Australian disputes to go to UN committees quite contrary to the philosophy of the Australia Act. Senator Carr has no role in standing up in this chamber and speaking about the independence of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs tabled its Final Report on a National Drought Policy in July 1992.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Minister for Primary Industries and Energy should urgently consider the proposals presented by the National Farmers' Federation and the Cattle Council of Australia to alleviate the effects of extreme drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Drought Policy which was agreed by the Agricultural Council of Australia and New Zealand in July 1992 was announced by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Hon Simon Crean, in August 1992. The policy sees drought as a normal feature of Australian agriculture which should be treated as such. The main focus is on farm management which takes into account the risks associated with drought and adheres to the principles of sustainable agriculture. The Drought Policy Statement is at Attachment A to this response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues raised by the SSCRRA and the Government's response are set out below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Drought Policy should encourage a self-reliant approach to drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Drought Policy (NDP) encourages self reliant approaches to drought by treating it as one of the many risks for which managers of the farm business must prepare. The Policy seeks to address the past approach of reliance on Government assistance during drought periods by removing the emphasis on transaction based subsidies and drought declarations. The NDP seeks to improve farmers' management skills so that they can make appropriate business decisions in a deregulated economy. This will be achieved by providing farmers with property management planning training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy should ensure adequate maintenance and protection of livestock and other resources to ensure early recovery from drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In encouraging farmers to take a self reliant approach to managing the risks associated with drought, farmers are being encouraged, through property management planning training, to take the necessary steps to protect their basic resources including the land and their livestock. Farmers are being encouraged to develop management strategies which establish agricultural production levels in accordance with land capability and practices which ensure conservation of natural resources and ecosystems. Under these strategies, farmers are urged to undertake appropriate management actions, such as destocking in time of drought. Support may be available to farmers to assist them to recover following a period of exceptional circumstances, such as severe drought, as well as obtaining support through the period of downturn. Under the exceptional circumstance provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme, eligible farmers may be able to access up to 100 per cent interest subsidies on finance to make productivity improvements, including restocking and pasture replanting. Drought should not be reinstated within the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Drought Policy confirms that drought will not be reinstated within the NDRA. The Drought Policy Review Task Force recommended against the reinstatement of drought within the Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements as this approach "would be anathema to a more equitable, efficient and environmentally responsible policy framework and in promoting a more self-reliant approach to the management of drought". This recommendation was endorsed by Commonwealth and State agricultural Ministers and forms the basis of the National Drought Policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That a number of problems with the Rural Adjustment Scheme, which is the principal source of Commonwealth assistance to farmers in financial difficulties due to drought, should be addressed in the 1992 Review of the Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comprehensive review of the Rural Adjustment Scheme undertaken in 1992, examined all aspects of the Scheme's operation. In particular its recommendations focused on the mechanisms for achieving structural adjustment in the rural sector. In considering these recommendations, the Government assessed their appropriateness within a rural policy framework for the development of a more forward looking and resilient rural sector. This process was instrumental in ensuring that Government involvement in providing support to the rural sector, particularly in time of severe downturn, is consistent with meeting overriding objectives of sustainability, productivity and profitability. Subsequent to the review of the Scheme that saw new arrangements for it put in place, a feedback process has been established whereby Authorities responsible for the administration of RAS in the States will be able to better tailor assistance according to actual effectiveness and emerging priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth should provide financial incentives for the preparation and management of drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth and State Governments gave serious consideration to this recommendation in formulating the National Drought Policy. Although some States indicated a preference for financial incentives, the general consensus was that they should not be offered as such incentives tend to distort the decision making process in favour of particular activities which may or may not be suitable to the circumstances affecting individual farms. For this reason, Governments agreed not to provide financial incentives but instead decided to provide farmers with training and general incentives to improve productivity through changes to the Rural Adjustment Scheme. Subsidies available under the Scheme may support eligible farmers to undertake drought preparedness measures, such as improving fodder and water storage. Importantly, grants are available for farmers to improve the financial management of their enterprises by accessing training and obtaining professional advice through RAS. Training is also available through the Property Management Planning campaign. These latter measures are seen as being important tools for achieving a more self-reliant farming sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An effective IED scheme should be introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to the Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) Scheme, including the implementation of a new Farm Management Bond were implemented by amending the relevant legislation in December 1992. The adjustments to the IED Scheme were aimed at improving its operation and making it more attractive so as to encourage greater self-reliance during downturns. In particular, Farm Management Bonds are a more concessional tranche within the overall IED Scheme, expressly designed as a provision against hardship arising from natural events such as drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should review taxation arrangements for drought related expenditure, including the introduction of tax credits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has already implemented a number of measures to ameliorate the impact of drought on farmers. In deciding upon appropriate assistance measures, the Government analysed the scope for using tax measures to encourage drought preparedness and concluded that the taxation system is not the most effective mechanism to deliver assistance for farmers to undertake drought related expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration should be given to the introduction of transitional arrangements for Commonwealth drought assistance pending the full implementation of the NDP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that such transitional arrangements are unnecessary now that a National Drought Policy has been agreed and is being implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IED review should consider the extension of income smoothing and tax averaging provisions to non-farm rural businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income smoothing and tax averaging provisions were examined in the course of the IED Review. The Government has decided that the existing tax averaging arrangements should be retained. Problems will be experienced in defining eligible enterprises if the Scheme is extended to rural non-farm businesses. This situation could result in inequities in regard to other non-farm businesses suffering variable fortunes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New approaches to self-reliance should be accompanied by information programs and relevant advisory services and training programs that develop farm business and financial management skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the package of measures announced in the National Drought Policy, the Government has provided funding for a strategy to communicate to farmers the need for more self reliant approaches to risks such as drought which are part of farm management. Funds have also been provided for a Property Management Planning campaign in association with the National Landcare Program, to train farmers in improved property management planning, including the management of risks such as drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resources should be directed towards research into climate prediction and resources should be extended in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Meteorology received Commonwealth funding of $136 million in 1992-93, of which some $64 million was for operation of the  basic national meteorological data collection and processing infrastructure. This supports the full range of Bureau services including the national climate monitoring and prediction service which costs an additional $1.2 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau also maintained a program of climate research, costing approximately $1 million in 1992-93, directed towards improved climate prediction on seasonal to interannual timescales relevant to drought.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian research on climate prediction, involving the Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO and the universities, is carried out within the international framework of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP). A major international WCRP initiative in 1992-93, involving 20 countries and costing about $US50 million, was the TOGA COARE (Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment) co-ordinated from an operations base in Townsville. It has contributed to increased understanding of the role of the Western Pacific Ocean in influencing the variability of climate on timescales of months to years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is currently near the forefront of nations providing operationally useful climate services on the basis of present understanding of the global climate system.

The Bureau and the US National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration are jointly examining the scope or implementation of an operational system for climate prediction on seasonal to interannual timescales for the Western Pacific region in association with a proposed International Research Institute for Climate Prediction, possible located in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also provided $2.1 million in additional funding to the Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation to fund drought related research. Some of this research is in the area of climate prediction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth Government has a responsibility to provide additional assistance during severe drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that there will be droughts of such severity that property managers will not have been able to plan effectively for them. Under such circumstances the Government has used the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme, which, in conjunction with State Governments, may provide severely drought affected farmers with up to 100 per cent interest subsidies. In 1992-93, the Commonwealth Government provided $16.5 million for eligible farmers experiencing the effects of prolonged drought in Queensland and western New South Wales. A further $11 million has been allocated for this purpose in 1993-94. Assistance in severe drought needs to be consistent and clearly enunciated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By its very nature severe drought is an exceptional circumstance for which special assistance is required and as such assistance needs to be tailored to meet the special circumstances. To the extent that it is appropriate, however, such special assistance is provided in a consistent and predictable manner. The exceptional circumstances provisions of the RAS have been clearly enunciated and when ever they are invoked, due attention is paid to ensuring that affected people are informed of the arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister for Primary Industries and Energy should urgently consider the proposals presented by the National Farmers' Federation and the  Cattle Council of Australia to alleviate the effects of extreme drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing the new arrangements for the Rural Adjustment Scheme, which is the major delivery mechanism for assistance during severe downturns including drought, the Government considered submissions from a broad spectrum of interests including peak industry organisations. Special assistance for severe drought may be provided under the exceptional circumstance provisions of RAS. The Government bases its consideration of the introduction of increased support under the RAS exceptional circumstance provision on the receipt of advice by the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council. The Council has representation from State and Commonwealth Governments, the National Farmers' Federation, and people with expertise in economics, financial administration, banking, sustainable agriculture, farm management or training. In preparing its report, the Council is required to consult with interested parties. The Council's recommendations will include recommendations on the level and duration of support that may be provided to eligible farmers appropriate to the circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA>The report by the Schools Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen&mdash;Reviewing the `compulsory' years of schooling</EMPHASIS>, was written after a two-year review of the compulsory years of schooling in Australia. It advocates a national policy framework. Many of the reforms that have been advocated in this report rely on the Commonwealth government taking a leading role in the quality of teaching and learning in schools in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report stresses the need to reduce unnecessary interstate differences, such as the school starting age, and calls for the establishment of a national framework for the monitoring and reporting of educational outcomes. Perhaps controversially, recommendation four of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS> report addresses the issues of primary and secondary schooling. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Schools Council recommends that the Commonwealth encourage the Australian Education Council to consider the merits of relinquishing the `primary/secondary' description for the stages of schooling in favour of a categorisation which reflects the following three phases of children's and young people's development:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.       <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">childhood;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.       <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">young adulthood.</PARA>
<PARA>The second and third parts of the report address the issues of curricula, teaching and teacher education. The report advocates the use of a national curriculum statement and profiles to achieve greater continuity between the different stages and levels of schooling from kindergarten to year 12. It stresses the need for language and literacy to be more substantial and a compulsory part of training for all teachers and the need for the upgrading of teachers of science and technology in our schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular interest to me is the section on access and equity. I would like to highlight the recommendation made by this report which calls on the Commonwealth to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . continue to support the development of a National Strategy for Equity in Schools which includes the following elements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the harnessing of Commonwealth, State/Territory and non-government resources to the achievement of nationally agreed priorities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the establishment of a national database which makes possible the comparison of the range of educational outcomes of disadvantaged groups with that of the average student population;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   the publication of information on the resources, from all sources, which are being allocated to the achievement of equity outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the way in which the Schools Council is trying to find out exactly how much money is spent on access and equity, the report is an important contribution to the national debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the report highlights the need for an analysis of the resource differentials between the schools providing compulsory and post-compulsory education. It endorses the Commonwealth's commitment to examine the level of funding for public primary schools with a view to improving early literacy learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very progressive report which contributes in important ways to the national debate about the future directions of our schools. Unfortunately, it comes at a time when some state governments are cutting drastically and very severely the provision of resources available to schools. We are seeing quite dramatic reductions in the number of teachers that are available for the teaching of children in this country; the closing of hundreds of public schools; the withdrawal of curriculum support services; and, in the case of Victoria, severe restrictions on the legal rights of members, parents and teachers of school councils to go through the legal system to try to prevent the closure of community schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I am pleased that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Five to fifteen</EMPHASIS> report advocates a greater national focus&mdash;a focus which recognises the national role in determining the national education agenda. The Commonwealth's role in ensuring education equity, with an emphasise on equality of opportunity, is fundamental to this approach. It is on this basis that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has highlighted, in recent times, the great disparities that exist within the Commonwealth about the way in which resources are being allocated. While the report indicates that the primary focus of education administration in this country will always be the state, it is important that the Commonwealth take an increasing role to ensure and guarantee that basic educational rights for all children in this country are protected, and so that we do not see the undermining of the very valuable and high quality state education systems that are being provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> contains reports which contrast that sort of attitude. We see in Victoria the report indicating that there are increasing resources going to the private sector at a time of massive reductions in the resources available to the public sector. This report by the Schools Council is a timely report. It is an important part of the national debate. I would hope that, at the national education minister's meeting that will occur in December, serious work will be done on establishing of a national agenda to ensure that these recommendations are acted upon. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Audit Office probe into the relocation of the Civil Aviation Authority's Launceston based air traffic services centre has found that a lack of cooperation between the Tasmanian university and the Civil Aviation Authority contributed to the centre's demise in Launceston. I am concerned at that lack of cooperation between the two parties&mdash;each of which had their own agenda. The lack of determination by all parties to make the course succeed was largely the reason why Launceston has lost the course to the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the establishment of the centre in Launceston in 1989 is now described as being experimental and did not rule out different arrangements in the future&mdash;which is, in fact, news to me&mdash;it was vital that the university ensured that the course was well run, properly evaluated, and met the requirements of the Civil Aviation Authority. Sadly, the report reveals that the university failed to do this and, therefore, probably never had any chance of retaining the course&mdash;especially when we recall that there was considerable angst in the Civil Aviation Authority, at some levels, at the course being located in Launceston in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Civil Aviation Authority did little to really change this unsatisfactory situation. Once again, its poor administration has been highlighted. Over recent years, a number of instances of damning reports of the CAA's incompetence over a prolonged period have come before the Senate. A more determined approach on its part may have stopped the problem from developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report reveals that the program received limited modification after it was inherited from the Civil Aviation Authority. Thereafter, there were few attempts by the curriculum advisory committee, the Civil Aviation Authority or the university to ensure that an adequate evaluation program had been established for the ongoing review, revision and development of the course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program appeared unable to adequately integrate job theory with job requirements. The management of the training program was poorly defined. There was open conflict of interests at the Launceston campus between academics and the coordinator and the teaching staff, and between the Civil Aviation Authority and university management. Trainees were placed in the field without adequate performance, assessment and evaluations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most damning of all, in my view, is that the report discloses that there was evidence that the need for course refinement and revision of administrative processes was recognised, but requests to the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology, as it was then called&mdash;it is now a university&mdash;did not result in action being taken to ensure that the training program satisfied the Civil Aviation Authority's requirements. As a measure of the inadequacy of the course as it was allowed to develop, of the 160 students who commenced the first three courses only 70 were able to get jobs as air traffic controllers. All this incompetence cost the long suffering taxpayer almost $17 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also highlights the fact that, while the Civil Aviation Authority is trying to sell its building, it does not own the land on which the building is situated. So its ability to sell to anybody very meaningfully is very much restricted. It is interesting to note that the ground is owned by the state of Tasmania and the University of Tasmania has made it very clear that it will take a dim view of it being sold to anybody else as it is on its campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably, therefore, the taxpayer will not get much return from a building in which taxpayers' funds were substantially invested. Any dollars which the University of Tasmania pays to buying the building which is effectively on its land will be dollars which are also contributed by those same long suffering taxpayers. The taxpayers had better be warned that the federal government's intention, in closing down the course in Launceston, is to relocate it in two facilities on the mainland, which will mean that those same taxpayers will get some more big bills soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when our region is desperately trying to find industry and activities which promote growth and jobs&mdash;the focus of the government's efforts at the moment is supposed to be to try to create jobs in regional areas&mdash;to lose a national course which attracted students Australia-wide and which, sadly, had unrealised but great potential to attract overseas students, in these circumstances is unforgivable and I will never forget it. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">REPORT ON VIDEO AND COMPUTER GAMES AND CLASSIFICATION ISSUES OCTOBER 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TABLING STATEMENT BY COMMITTEE CHAIRPERSON, SENATOR MARGARET REYNOLDS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the report tabled today, the Committee has examined two issues: the availability of unclassified video and computer games and the system for the classification of films and videos.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to video and computer games, the Committee's concerns are directed at the proliferation in Australia of games with unacceptable levels of violence or sexual activities as their themes. The Committee's concerns are shared by the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers, the meeting of Federal, State and Territory ministers with censorship responsibility. At their meeting in June 1993 the Ministers announced that they had agreed to bring video and computer games under the control of the national censorship system, and requested the Chief Censor and State and Territory officials to formulate a scheme for regulation to be presented at the Minister's next meeting, to be held on 4 and 5 November. The Committee has expedited its inquiry in order to bring down this interim report for the consideration of the Censorship Ministers at that meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendations envisage a scheme of regulation of the content of video and computer games with the classification set by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. The Committee concluded that the absence of classification of such games, and reliance only on industry self-regulation, threatens to undermine the community's efforts to regulate the availability of graphically violent and sexual material in games to minors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee will monitor the decisions of the meeting of Censorship Ministers, and will continue to take evidence in relation to video and computer games, and will be in a position to report to the Senate on progress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's concern about the system of classification of films and videos was prompted by the decision in January 1993 of the Film and Literature Board of Review to release the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> with an `R' rating, overturning a decision of the Film Censorship Board to maintain a ban on the film's release of 17 years standing. The Committee's terms of reference include a requirement that it consider whether material which would be classified in the `R' and `X' categories should be permitted on pay TV. The Committee was able to use the consideration of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> by the classification authorities as a "window" into the operations of the system which has the potential to eventually permit `R' or `X' material onto pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's inquiry highlighted a number of systemic flaws in the classification system and its report has recommended the implementation of a number of important remedial measures, particularly in relation to the restructuring of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, which is the umbrella Commonwealth agency housing the Film Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review. The Committee recognises that the adjudication of community standards will always fall to certain individuals tasked with that role and that there will inevitably be differences of opinion about decisions which arise from such a system. The Committee was concerned, however, about the idiosyncratic nature of the current system, which gives little certainty to the community about what material will or will not be released. The Committee's recommendations are directed at ensuring that the classification system, as far as possible, meets prevailing community standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers is scheduled to discuss these issues at its forthcoming meeting in November, when it will examine in detail the proposals of the Law Refom Commission for greater uniformity in film and literature classification as contained in its September 1991 report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Censorship Procedure</EMPHASIS>. As with its recommendations in relation to the regulation of video and computer games, the Committee urges the Ministers to agree to the early implementation of the Committee's proposals for reforms in the film and video classification system.</PARA>

<PARA>At the outset we were received as old friends. There was no doubt about the American and Australian respect and affection for each other. We were able to strengthen ties between the two countries further. We certainly put forward in a very forceful way our views about the agricultural subsidy scheme, the export enhancement program, and its effect on Australian agriculture. It is true that not all Americans understand what is happening in regard to the damage to our industry and in terms of the price they pay as taxpayers of that nation. There are a couple of recommendations in the report which are very important and very sensible. One of them states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Delegation recommends that the Australian Government commission a detailed study of the costs to American consumers, and to producers in related industries, of the current United States agricultural subsidies and import restrictions on agricultural produce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The results of the study should be</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.made widely known amongst United States Congressional representatives as well as to members of the wider community who are adversely affected by these protectionist agricultural policies;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.used to identify sectors of the United States community with whom strategic partnerships may be fostered to promote alternative agricultural and trade policies that would benefit Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a practical way in which we will begin to turn around the unfortunate position we have in regard to our agricultural production and how it suffers because of the policies of the EEC and USA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also looked at the way in which Austrade operated in America. We made a further recommendation which relates to looking at some of the old areas in which Austrade has operated for so many years. Those resources could be better utilised in other areas which have a very promising future&mdash;that is, the area of Seattle and on the west coast of America on the Pacific rim. These are a couple of very useful recommendations which should go into the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had access to some fairly influential people in the US, including the leaders of each of the parties in the Congress and the Senate. We spoke to Vice President Gore who showed a great deal of understanding and knowledge of a number of matters including world population growth, environmental pollution and unemployment, which I believe are three very important issues that concern everybody throughout the world. </PARA>

He said that all areas of cooperation between our countries were  vital and that we must not only continue that but also enhance cooperation and make it stronger. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of Senator Ian Macdonald's private member's bill which I believe remedies a defect and fulfils a promise that was made by the government during the passage of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill. I would like to point out that the position of councils at the present time is quite unfair. It is this unfairness that my colleague Senator Macdonald, a Liberal from Queensland, seeks to rectify.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He wishes to ensure that the superannuation guarantee levy can be paid on behalf of elected councillors and aldermen. As a result of this contribution on their allowance, they could be ineligible for deductibility for private superannuation, particularly if 10 per cent or more of their income comes from a source which provides employer superannuation support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could have the impact of discouraging people from volunteering their services to become aldermen or councillors. This is unfair. It is something that the government never intended. It is something the government indicated quite strongly it intended to rectify but has not done so. I pay tribute to Senator Macdonald for his initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that I begin with a reference to page 145 of the second report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. There the government made a formal response to the issue of local government councillors and the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislation&mdash;an issue which I must acknowledge was raised by the Australian Democrats at the time. This response was instrumental in gaining the Australian Democrats' support for the superannuation guarantee charge legislation package last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the government publicly stated, by means of this response, that it intended to move an amendment to the superannuation guarantee charge legislation to remove what the government itself characterised as a technical defect. The government said that it `seemingly brings local councillors automatically within the definition of employee'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response went on to state that local councillors who received a monthly payment for attending meetings would not be covered by the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act. These statements were made in a report issued June 1992, some 15 months ago or more. The government's apparent intention at the time to exclude these particular councillors is clearly set out in a letter that the former Minister for Local Government, the honourable David Simmons, wrote to local councils in July 1992. His letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as Local Government elected members are concerned the new superannuation arrangements will only apply to councillors who are in receipt of salaries.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators should note the distinction between that and allowances. Yet section 12(10) of the Superannuation Guarantee Administration Act unequivocally states that a person who holds office as a member of a local government council is an employee of that council. Further, the definition of local government councillors' salaries or wages in section 11(1)(e) is so wide as to include mere allowances paid in respect of attending council meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What conclusion can then be drawn from the sharp contradiction between the legislation and the government's statement which has been made more than once on the public record. It is generally accepted that the government's failure to effect its promises on this particular issue is not a result of political dishonesty. Is it just pure indolence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government undeniably guilty of? Is it incompetence in drafting and promulgating legislation contrary to its own publicly declared position and intention? Or is it indolence in failing to act or even to show the slightest inclination to act to remedy this incompetence or defect? It is difficult to decide what sort of culpability is worst&mdash;dissembling and dishonesty or indolence and incompetence. I leave the government to judge that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It confers no credit on a government when an opposition has to be relied upon to repair legislatively the damage wrought by the government's inability to execute properly its own promises. It is fortunate that the opposition's spokesman on local government, Senator Macdonald, has proved to be equal to the task of remedying the government's carelessness. He has introduced a bill which effectively and succinctly removes those local government councillors who receive only limited allowances arising from the execution of their duties from the operation of the superannuation guarantee legislation. Such a result is consonant with the reasonable and intelligent view that councillors whose substantive form of employment or work is not with a council of which they are members and whose payment reflects this reality, cannot then be considered, according to Senator Macdonald, as employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Income Tax Assessment Act articulates this view of their proper status by virtue of section 221A(1). This interpretation section specifically excludes payments by way of remuneration or allowances to a member of a local governing body from the meaning of `salary or wages' under the PAYE system. Therefore, to argue that to remove local government councillors of the type with which we are concerned from the ambit of the superannuation guarantee charge is discriminatory or confers some sectional interest is to misapprehend the nature of their employment as well as their remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while this is just one problem caused by the superannuation guarantee charge, it is a problem which I believe is very easily remedied by this private member's bill introduced by my colleague Senator Macdonald. I believe that there are greater and more serious problems with compulsory superannuation, but their very gravity means that they are more intractable, at least in so far as it is within the opposition's power to effect a change in the short term. Further, it is a problem which the government has admitted and has promised to fix. The government should, on the basis of its own words, have no difficulty in accepting the amendments in Senator Macdonald's private member's bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot afford, in effect, to penalise those who seek to serve the community as local government representatives for no real remuneration.

I commend the private member's bill to all my colleagues in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) (Exemption of Council Allowances) Amendment Bill, and I would expect the government to support it as well. As indicated by Senator Watson, this matter was the subject of the deliberations and the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I make no apology for reminding the Senate, as did Senator Watson, in part, of the recommendations of the committee. I will quote extensively from the committee's recommendations because I think they need recognition. Point 2.9 on page 145 reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats propose that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. local government councillors be exempt from the SGC unless they are on normal salaries; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the contractors provision be clarified.</PARA>
<PARA>These are two of several proposals that the Democrats put forward. Under the heading `Local government councillors', the government response reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends moving an amendment to the SGC legislation to remove a technical defect that seemingly brings local councillors automatically within the definition of `employee'. The Australian Taxation Office has advised that the word `payment' in the relevant clause of the Bill be changed to the word `remuneration'.</PARA>
<PARA>I will say a little more about that soon. The government response continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this amendment will result in local councillors who receive salary or wages being covered by the Superannuation Guarantee. Other local councillors, who typically receive a monthly payment for attending meetings, will not be covered by the Superannuation Guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator McMullan, as parliamentary secretary, clarified and confirmed that when speaking on this matter on 24 June 1992. Senator McMullan was granted leave to incorporate a document in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Under the heading `Minimising impact on employers', the document stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of consultations with the Australian Democrats and the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee, the Government has decided to move certain amendments to the Bill with the object of reducing the initial impact on employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current exempt salary level below which contributions do not have to be made for an employee will be raised for $250 per month to $450.</PARA>
<PARA>That is relevant to local government councillors. It is a first step in looking at the typical sort of salary that the legislation would refer to. It is also an indication of the degree to which the government had consulted and made moves to change the way that this superannuation guarantee was to be applied. Further down, under the heading of `Local councillors', Senator McMullan's document stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill presently defines "salary or wages" to include payments to local councillors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed will replace the word "payment" with "remuneration" to make it clear that only payments for work done by councillors will be salary or wages. This amendment will also apply in respect of other Commonwealth, State or Territory employees.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether the effect of that was fully understood by those who were required to interpret it, but I remind the Senate of the genesis of that movement. We were told&mdash;and I have just quoted this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Taxation Office has advised that the word `payment' in the relevant clause be changed to the word `remuneration'.</PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who read and took note of that comment&mdash;this included Senator Cheryl Kernot and Senator Richard Alston&mdash;rightly assumed that that would be the way to get the technical defect addressed. But it seemed that it was not. When speaking on 24 June 1992 during the committee stage consideration of superannuation legislation, I thought Senator Alston interpreted the position correctly when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same can be said in relation to local government councillors. Our fundamental objection&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, that of the coalition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that a whole series of people are being unnecessarily swept up in this legislation to the extent that we will have many more inaccurate accounts than ever before. To the extent that this amendment at least makes it clear that only payments for work done by councillors will be salaries or wages, it is an improvement and is in line with the representations that have been made to us. We therefore welcome that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston correctly interpreted from what had been said by Senator McMullan and from the recommendations that had been made that the amendment would be able to redress the situation. At the time, Senator Kernot said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree with the comments of Senator Alston in respect to payments to a complying fund, local councillors and the consequent technical amendments.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought nothing could have been clearer. I would have thought nothing could have been clearer to anybody who was required to read the second reading speeches and interpret the intent of the government. However, as Senator Macdonald has explained&mdash;he is to be congratulated for bringing this matter forward&mdash;and as Senator Watson has observed, this interpretation has not been shared by the Australian Taxation Office. For the life of me, I cannot understand why because it was the Taxation Office that recommended this course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Watson noted, Mr Simmons, who should have known exactly what was intended, wrote to councils expressing the opinion and the intent of the government. I have a copy of the same letter that Senator Watson quoted from; and I think it is worth quoting from another part of that letter. The very first sentence reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to dispel any concerns your Council may have concerning the application of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>The intent was to dispel concerns. The paragraph after the one that Senator Watson quoted reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government avoided arrangements that would have characterised elected members as employees of councils.</PARA>
<PARA>What could be clearer than that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have been contacted by the Hobart City Council which has had a very blunt and clear communication from the Australian Taxation Office which flies in the face of the express intent of the government. The rulings that have come from the Taxation Office in relation to the Superannuation Guarantee Act deem&mdash;there is that famous word. It seems that it is possible to deem so much these days which is not fact. For the purpose of the convenience of those who are administering things, it seems too easy for deeming to ignore what is fact and certainly to ignore what is the intent of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation ruling that I was shown by the Hobart City Council directly contradicted the Taxation Office's own recommendation to this government that the word `payment' in the relevant clause be changed to `remuneration' to indicate that those who were in receipt of those payments were not in fact employees of the council. As a matter of fact, the coincidence here is that before I came to this place I was an elected member of the Hobart City Council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether to apologise or to spend time regaling the Senate with the wonderful time that I had there. One of the things that gave me the experience to comment on this particular situation is that the assumptions made in much of the decision making connected with this matter do not apply to that council at least. Even payments for attending meetings did not exist. The elected members of that council were not in receipt of such payments. In fact, no cash payments whatsoever were made. However, some benefits were derived. One was simply the replacement of petrol used in travelling on council business and another was the sharing of council meals during meetings. I would be struggling to evaluate those benefits. I hardly think that would qualify the elected members to be classified as employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intent in that situation was that those who were serving the community were in fact doing that and not receiving any payment whatsoever. I do not know how many other local governments in Australia are in a similar situation. I do not think it is right to assume that all elected local members are paid sitting fees. I think that is a pretty broad assumption and one which certainly does not accord with my experience or the experience of those who have spoken to me about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any need to elaborate on this matter. The more talking we do on it, the more confused those who are trying to interpret the intentions of the government might become. I would have thought that the few things that I read were patently clear. How they can be interpreted in any other way beats me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The addition of a considerable amount of administrative mumbo jumbo, the cost to the community, the inconvenience to individuals and to local governments and discouragement from serving local communities&mdash;all those factors&mdash;have derived from this clumsy attempt by the Taxation Office to cover a loophole which I do not think exists. If the amendment moved by the government did not have the effect that it was supposed to have, I would also blame the government to some extent for not getting it right in the first place. I think that continuing the debate would only serve to confuse the matter. </PARA>

I am sorry that the Australian Labor Party has not treated this with any seriousness at all. The bill was introduced on 1 September. The government has had every opportunity to look at this matter since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really shows that the government, in spite of all its rhetoric, treats local government with some derision. I would have hoped that the government would have either indicated support for this bill or come up with some amendments of its own. I acknowledge that bit of light-hearted comment from Senator Robert Ray&mdash;and from Senator Bell to a certain extent&mdash;about the fact that the Australian Democrats are supporting the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise that this is a very serious matter. The only reason I am raising it in this bill is that it specifically and very seriously affects local government, although perhaps not in Hobart City Council's case. As Senator Bell rightly said, some councillors in some states do not receive any `payment'&mdash;whether it be remuneration, allowances or reimbursements. I do not want to confuse things by picking a word and so I will simply say `payment'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that some councils throughout Australia do not receive any payments. But in some instances elected representatives of local government do receive payments, usually a very small amount such as $3,000 or $4,000 and perhaps even $6,000 to $10,000. Of course, there are some, like the Brisbane City Council, whose elected representatives receives salaries equal to those received by federal parliamentarians. There are other councillors who receive various intermediate amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my friends Senator Watson and Senator Bell have pointed out, the anomaly which came to light still has not been corrected in this legislation. This is in spite of the very clear intention of the government and in spite of assurances by Mr Simmons before the election, in a letter which we have tabled previously, and in a press release which I have only recently come across and which I might seek leave to incorporate later on. The government introduced some amendments which it thought&mdash;and I concede that we and the Democrats thought&mdash;might fix the issue, but they really have not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was referred to the Taxation Office for a determination. That determination said: `No. It doesn't do what everyone thought it would do'. The effect of it, very briefly, is that those councillors who receive a payment and whose councils pay the superannuation guarantee charge on that payment are then prevented from claiming their own contributions to their own personal superannuation schemes as a tax deduction. For their contribution to society and for being good people and making a contribution in their own local community they are being penalised. I think that is terribly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I have introduced this private member's bill&mdash;to try to get the government to do something about it. If the Democrats first thought of it&mdash;and perhaps they did&mdash;that is great and I give them every credit for it. Senator Watson, of course, as even Senator Robert Ray acknowledges, has seriously looked at this issue and understood it&mdash;and many do not understand taxation or superannuation issues. We all know that if Senator Watson understands it and makes a contribution, we are going on the right track. But I present this bill in a genuine attempt to help local government and local government councillors to do the sorts of things that I think, in all truthfulness, everyone set out to do but which has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has been told about it time and time again. It has refused, for reasons that we do not know, to do anything about it. That is the purpose of this private member's bill. It will, I understand, pass through the Senate. As Senator Ray quite rightly says, the matter then has to go to the lower house where, obviously, the Labor Party has the numbers. But I do urge Senator Ray, Senator Richardson, Senator McMullan and particularly the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, whose responsibility is local government, to seriously look at the issues and to do something to correct this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very technical matter. I will amend my own bill in the committee stage because, since introducing the bill, I have had a further look at it. I have had some advice and I have spoken to the local government peak bodies around Australia and they have made some suggestions to me. As a result of that, we have drafted some amendments, but the effect of the amendments will, together with the original bill that I have presented, try to fix the anomalous situation that has resulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of local government&mdash;a very important level of government, a very important sphere of government in the Australian system of government&mdash;and the interests of the people who, in many instances, voluntarily or at very small payment contribute to their own local communities, I urge the Senate to support this bill.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the second reading of this Bill, I highlighted the anomaly that exists relating to the existing Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (SGAA), requiring the Superannuation Levy to be paid to elected Councillors and Aldermen who receive allowances. The result is that Councillors and Aldermen then do not comply with the definition of an "eligible person" in Section 82AAS(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act (ITAA) and cannot claim a tax deduction for any personal contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only an "eligible person" can claim deductions for private superannuation and you are not an "eligible person" if Lo% or more of your income comes from a source which provides to you employer funded superannuation support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This consequently disallows Councillors and Aldermen from claiming in their income tax return, a deduction of up to $3000 plus 75% of any amount above, for their own personal superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore we have a situation where an Alderman could receive a Council allowance of $6000, have self-employed assessable income of $50000 and would not be entitled to claim any private superannuation contributions as a tax deduction, due to the Council paying the princely sum of $300p.a. in compulsory superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is completely improper and ridiculous that many hard-working community conscious citizens are actually financially discriminated against by this Federal Labor Government, preventing them from claiming the tax deduction they would get if they weren't on their Local Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Local Government strives to be a partner in governing the community while the Federal Government appears to be working against this concept. The Government continues to impose rules and regulations on Local Government that make its task difficult and sometimes impossible to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his press release dated 2nd July 1992, the then Minister for Local Government, the Hon. David Simmons said "The approach taken by the Government (regarding the SGAA relating to Councillors) is consistent with that taken in respect of Fringe Benefits Tax, which does not apply to elected members because they are not employees of councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now we are already into the second financial year since this legislation took effect and Labor's attempt to overcome this anomaly, was to change the word "payments" to "remuneration" in the definition of salary and wages in the SGAA. This has only created more confusion and concern, leading to the Australian Taxation Office issuing a Draft Superannuation Guarantee Determination, SGD 93/D4.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this Determination the Taxation Commissioner has ignored the clear intention of the Parliament and deemed in the strictest technical sense that Local Government Councillors are in the employ of the Council and allowances paid to Councillors are salary or wages for the purposes of the SGAA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This actually contravenes some State Local Government Acts which specifically provide that a Councillor cannot be in the employ of the council with disqualification as the penalty. Employees of Councils are also expressly excluded from standing for election to the council by which they are employed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, the relationship between a Councillor and a Council bears little resemblance to that existing between an employer and its employee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two tests at common law show why councillors should not be regarded as "employees".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no Master/Servant relationship and most Councillors are employed in another occupation or are involved in other activities. Council work is therefore not the predominant activity more an extracurricular activity, where they are giving up the free time to benefit the community in which they live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has agreed Councillors are not employees and the former Minister for Local Government has also stated "As far as Local Government is concerned, the new superannuation contributions will apply only to Brisbane City councillors who are in receipt of salaries." At least, that was their stated intent&mdash;but their legislative changes have not achieved this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the Labor Party has still not lived up to their promise to move amendments that overcome anomalies in the SGAA relating to Local Government members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council members who are not full-time in the job and whose main source of income comes from their own business activities should not lose their ability to deduct private superannuation contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that none of these payments are "salary or wages" under ordinary concepts, and the fact that Councillors are not "employees" at common law, the neatest approach is to allow Councillors to elect whether they are caught by the SGAA without using such terms as "allowance" and "fee" which vary in usage from State to State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore the SGAA should allow Councillors to elect whether they are caught by the SGAA to extinguish the present injustice denying Local Government Councillors the right to claim their personal superannuation contributions as a tax deduction. This then allows Councillors who wish not to be paid the SGC the opportunity to opt out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This can be achieved by amending my Private Senators Bill as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Clause 4, page 2, paragraph (b), proposed paragraph, substitute the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) remuneration of a person referred to in paragraph (12)(10) who has made an election mentioned in that paragraph.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment allows individual Councillors to determine what is best for them in their particular individual circumstances and would result in the following 3 scenarios.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. If a Councillor's pay from a Council is less than 10% of that persons total assessable income, and the Councillor elects to be an employee, then payment by the Council of the SGC does not remove the Councillor from the definition of "eligible person" and the Councillor can therefore claim a tax deduction for his own superannuation contribution and he or she still gets the SGC. (The only change from the present legislation being that an election must be made).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. If a Councillor's pay from a Council is more than 10% of that persons total assessable income, then if that person elects to be an employee the Councillor will get the SGC but will not be an "eligible person" and can not claim tax deductions for his own superannuation contributions. (The only change from the present legislation being that an election must be made).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. If a Councillor's pay from a Council is more than 10% of that persons total assessable income, and if that person does not elect to be an employee, then the Councillor is still an "eligible person" for the purposes of the ITAA and can claim as a tax deduction his own super contributions, but would not of course be eligible for any SGC contribution by his Council. (This corrects the current inequitable situation whereby such a person is not eligible for a tax deduction and therefore is discouraged from service as a Local Government Councillor).</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that arises is that non-employment income to be included in assessable income for a sole proprietor is gross sales, yet for a partner in a partnership it is the net partnership distribution. Therefore, a person in a partnership is severely disadvantaged compared with a sole proprietor. I ask Senator McMullan to have a look at this when he is looking at this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not directly relevant to the bill before us but it does relate to the question of assessable income for personal superannuation contributions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put on record the Australian Democrats' support for the Audit (Auditor-General an Officer of the Parliament) Amendment Bill 1993. It is the duty of the Auditor-General's office to scrutinise government on behalf of parliament. We all know that in the last few years the power of the executive government has risen tremendously and that the Auditor-General, basically, was caught between two conflicting duties: firstly, to the executive government, which had the purse strings and had the control of the resources available to the Auditor-General; and, secondly, his acknowledged duty to provide reports on scrutiny of government departments and the activities of government generally to the parliament. It is therefore very fitting that the Auditor-General be made an officer of the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that this issue has been on the table of this parliament for some time. In March 1989, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts argued in its report No. 296 on the Auditor-General that a strong audit office is essential for the maintenance of accountability of federal government organisations and officials to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two main difficulties that that report identified were the resource constraints that I have mentioned&mdash;and successive Auditors-General have seen fit to draw attention to that&mdash;and the fact that the Auditor-General really must, in particular, examine the unit that allocates resources, that is, the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public accounts committee identified five major reasons underlying the Auditor-General's main problems. The first is parliamentary complacency. The second is the conflict between the two duties to the legislature and to the executive. As Senator Watson says, complacency of the legislature is something that this bill seeks to remedy and that is why the Democrats are supporting it. Another is the lack of a mechanism which, according to the public accounts committee, would allow parliament to assume responsibility for the office. Clearly, this is something that we are rectifying today. There is also a lack of awareness of the importance of the audit of government activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether that latter point has not gradually over the last few years become less apparent. It seems to me that the tabling of consecutive audit reports in this chamber at least has drawn attention to the work of the Auditor-General. The importance of the work of that office in keeping a tight check and scrutiny of government activities has, I think, been reinforced. I do not wish to detain the chamber. I repeat that the Democrats will, for all the reasons I have outlined,  support this bill. </PARA>

<PARA>Last Friday, ministers or their representatives from the coalition states met here with the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) on the proposed industrial relations legislation. At best, I believe it can be described as a fiasco or an exercise in futility. The points the ministers or their representatives put and the concerns they had were not given consideration. In fact, they went away, having been told that the legislation would proceed regardless of their states' views. I want to touch on the key points of concern that they raised with regard to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the proposals will not bring the flexibility so urgently needed in the labour market. Regrettably, the proposals will allow enterprise agreements only when they relate to the equivalent of over-award payments&mdash;and I emphasise that point. Secondly, the proposed system is extremely complicated and will not assist micro-economic reform or aid real change in the workplace. Thirdly, the bargaining position of unions has been greatly enhanced, and the totality of the measures has placed employers in a vulnerable position. This will not encourage employers to hire additional labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the watering down of the current sanctions relating to secondary boycotts and their removal from the Trade Practices Act is not warranted. The 72-hour provisions are unacceptable and could lead to the businesses of employers being unnecessarily harmed. Fifthly, meaningful recognition has not been given to the needs of the large non-unionised section of the work force. Sixth, the complexity of the various layers of awards and agreements with seemingly different procedures applicable to each will create confusion and will be an unnecessary burden. Those are the key points from that meeting. To me, they are the crux of the requirements if we are to address proper flexible market labour reform in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I make is that Mr Brereton, the Minister for Industrial Relations, promised all state governments the opportunity for consultation. Mr Brereton used the words `detailed and meaningful' when referring to that consultation. This offer was made in April 1993. This consultation has never occurred&mdash;and I emphasise that&mdash;and yet today, the industrial relations bill was brought into the other place. It is because of this lack of consultation that the states' views have not been taken into account and, as a result, the states have become very irritated. All this is from a government that consistently talks about the consultative approach, about negotiation, about coming to an agreement and about taking into consideration all the various points of view that are raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote some comments about this legislation. Minister Kierath from Western Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an indictment of Industrial Relations Minister Brereton that this agreement has been cobbled together without any input from or consultation with the states or employer organisations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that enterprise bargaining arrangements for the non-unionised sector represented a gross intrusion by unions into workplaces where they had no membership and no legitimate role. Minister Gude of Victoria said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no consultation, there is no consideration of our point of views at all and the legislation is to go through . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The New South Wales Industrial Relations Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the states had wanted time to review the legislation before reaching a decision&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a very reasonable consideration, I would suggest&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but this had been denied by Mr Brereton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It's impossible, absolutely impossible for the states to consult until we have seen the whole of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern we have got is that the commonwealth through Mr Brereton is using bully boy tactics to force the states into accepting their position without truly taking into account the concerns of the states and without consulting with the states.</PARA>
<PARA>I will go a little further and look at some other points of view from people outside the state governments and turn to industry organisations. The NFF attacked the government's consultative process, and said it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . disgusted by the way Mr Brereton ignored the views of employers.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Spicer of the ACCI said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However to date discussions have been a dialogue of the deaf; our views have been ignored and we have not even been informed of what the government's latest secret deal with the ACTU is.</PARA>
<PARA>Minister Gude of Mr Victoria said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This isn't just about industrial relations it is about absolute power corrupting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again from the ACCI; Mr Noakes, whom we all know well, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be an enormous amount of employer anger not only about the way they have been treated but also the outcome and the extent to which the government has been driven off course by the ACTU . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As we work through this process we find there has been a total lack of any meaningful consultation as far as this legislation is concerned; in fact, it is just a ramrod exercise. But we find it extends a little further. Just last month, the Victorian, Western Australian and Tasmanian labour ministers met and issued a joint statement attacking Mr Brereton for `failing to consult with them on industrial relations reform'. When looking through these comments we find that it is not only the coalition states which are raising concern as to this particular legislation, it is also the Labor states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from that statement by Labor ministers a month or so ago that they have now had the opportunity to provide input into the legislation, but none of the conservative states have. So I say to the government, and to Mr Brereton in particular, `You will listen to your mates but you won't listen to all the other people with regard to this legislation and how it impacts on the states and what will come out of it'. I have no doubt that the way this legislation has been handled will not improve the position with regard to enterprise agreements; it will not improve the culture in the workplace; it will not encourage non-union work forces to go into enterprise agreements&mdash;the legislation will, in fact, make it totally unattractive for them to go into enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minimum standards set by the federal government overriding state legislation is wrong. This issue should be solved between the federal and state governments cooperatively and harmoniously by negotiation, by discussion, by consultation, by give and take, and by all the things that are needed to get all parties working and pushing in the same direction. That will not come from this. Over the coming 12 to 18 months we will see this legislation being challenged consistently through the courts of this land. If that is the direction this government wants to take, it will be detrimental to our capacity to deal with some of the broader important issues such as unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unacceptable that the federal government is using a big stick approach to impose industrial relations issues on the states. Part of the big stick approach is the use of the alleged ILO inconsistencies and external affairs powers. As I have said before and I will say again, we in this country should be capable of putting together our own domestic law without going offshore to find out what we should do. I find it absolutely remarkable that those on the other side of this chamber and in the government in the other place have neither the brain power nor the will to address these problems without having to go somewhere else to get judgments to find out what to do; in other words, to get their marching orders. This whole approach defies commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government should be asking the states what they are doing and what they are planning to do, particularly in matters such as minimum wages and leave. I ask government senators who speak to this motion to tell us what consultation has taken place, what discussion they have had and what they really know about the detail of what is occurring in the states that have been prepared to look at labour market reform, move to do something constructive about it and not use the sledgehammer approach. That will be a real challenge for them, and I believe it is a challenge that they will not accept. They will not be able to answer those questions because there has been no consultation, no discussion and no communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will highlight a couple of examples of situations in my state where there has been a lack of consultation and discussion in addressing the issues of parental and paternal leave. In the Western Australian legislation there is also a proposal, which was debated in the state parliament last night&mdash;all night, in fact&mdash;with regard to adoption leave. That is just one aspect which I doubt government senators know anything about, purely and simply because they address only one side of the equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, Mr Kelty attended a meeting of our industrial relations backbench committee. We had a very useful, helpful and informative discussion. From the comments of Mr Kelty, I am sure that he found the meeting invaluable&mdash;as, of course, we did. But that does not happen with members of the government. They do not believe in taking into consideration all points of view and all aspects of a particular debate. They just do not carry that purpose through. In fact, they are moving more and more&mdash;and I will come to this later in my speech&mdash;to the sledgehammer approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the non-union sector will be treated is unacceptable. The fact that a union must be involved whether or not an employee is a member of a union is absolutely intolerable. The government talks about using the ILO conventions. But, when it suits it, the government conveniently forgets and ignores the convention that relates to freedom of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that these restrictions, barriers and red tape that have been put in the way will do is scare off not only employers but also employees. Something like 70 per cent of the employees in the work force do not want to be part of the union movement, and that is their right. Equally&mdash;and we have said this consistently&mdash;it is their right to join a union if they wish. This means that proper and serious involvement in true enterprise bargaining will be very limited. This element, along with many others, is and will be very limiting and inflexible. The coalition states feel that flexibility is an absolute must in this area. Of course, the Commonwealth government, by trying to override them by using the external affairs power, will limit this flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further example of inflexibility is the requirement for the agreement of at least 51 per cent of employees. What happens if 49 per cent do not agree? Why should they not be allowed to enter into an agreement separate from the 51 per cent, and the 51 per cent be allowed to keep working under their current conditions?  I think that is a reasonable proposition. I would like to hear the arguments against it. I believe that if part of the work force wishes to take that action, it should be able to. That would be a modern approach to industrial relations&mdash;not the sort of approach we are getting now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comments about sections 45D and 45E allegedly being put into the Industrial Relations Act. I will not debate the merits of what is being done. I have done it before and will do it in the future. I am told that the MOLAC meeting on Friday could not even be given the details of those amendments because they had not been finalised. That is another typical example of the incompetence of this government in dealing with these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be of great concern that, although the state ministers or their representatives came here last Friday, there was not some meaningful discussion before the legislation was introduced about what these proposals will mean and how they will operate. This is, once again, typical of the situation which exists. The ACTU knows what the proposals are and what they will mean, but the states, which will be greatly affected by this legislation, cannot even be told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other aspects to be considered. I know that my colleague Senator Chapman wishes to speak on this motion, so I will limit my comments to two or three other matters. We could talk all day about the incompetence of this government and the way it has handled this situation. </PARA>

The government has consistently said that. This is a classic example of it not doing what it has said it would. The government had the opportunity to do so. It had plenty of time to do so.

That is not a way I would suggest a federal government should do business with a state or states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise very strongly that the Western Australian government was elected with a far greater mandate than the current federal Labor government. Yet, when the Western Australian government moved to remove from students the financial burden of compulsory guild fees, the federal government, with its negotiation style, turned around and said, `We'll reduce some of your education funding if you go ahead with that'. That is a typical thuggery approach&mdash;`You do what we say or we will remove your funding'. We got that again on Tuesday in answer to a question regarding the Mabo legislation. Minister Crean said, `If you don't agree to our proposals, we're going to take away your soil conservation funding. We're going to put at risk the landcare program'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia led the national soil conservation program&mdash;the landcare program. It was the first state to amend the Soil Conservation Act. This took place back in 1981 or 1982, when Mr Dick Old was the Minister for Agriculture. We were the first state to put in place soil conservation districts. Western Australia has the most soil conservation districts. In fact, I understand that all the pastoral areas and some 80 per cent of the agricultural areas are covered by soil conservation districts. The federal government is once again saying, `If you don't do what we say, we will take your money away from you'. That is how this government operates. As Minister Gude said, this is all about power corrupting. It is about time this government took seriously a proper approach to Commonwealth-state relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that this arrangement really started to go backwards when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as Treasurer, stabbed the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, in the back.

We are now seeing a big effort to centralise all power in Canberra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the government's industrial relations package is supported by the trade union movement and no-one else. Less than 30 per cent of workers in the private sector are trade union members. Even if their leaders support this package, it is unlikely that all their rank and file members do. The business sector, encompassing both large and small businesses, is implacably opposed to the changes in their present form. But has the government consulted with business and adopted proposals to allay its fears? Not on your nelly. But it did consult with, and listen to, the unions. At their behest, it made significant changes to its initial proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major effect of the changes which it has made at the behest of the unions is to further entrench union privilege and power at the expense of the broader Australian community. Why not consult with business? It is the government's responsibility to govern for the whole Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers have legitimate concerns about important aspects of this package, but the only contact they have had from the government is to be told what is in the package. There has been no cooperative discussion or attempt to negotiate about differences between business and government over the package in the way there was between unions and government. There has just been dictatorial advice about what will be introduced. It is no wonder that employers are concerned. A majority of state governments are expressing similar concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this motion, which my colleague Senator Crane has moved, clearly highlights, the ministers for industrial relations in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory published a joint statement last week detailing their concerns about the federal government's industrial relations package and, like the employers, concerns about the lack of consultation in the development of the package. Among the points made in the statement, they have highlighted the fact that the ACTU&mdash;the union movement&mdash;is the only group that has been permitted to have any real say on the package. Thus the protection of trade union interests is the clear purpose of this industrial relations package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state ministers have also concluded that the legislation, if passed in its present form, will jeopardise any national economic recovery, and they are correct.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am telling the Senate about the concerns which the state industrial relations ministers have expressed about this package of legislation. It would do Senator Burns well to listen to those concerns. He might then be able to bring some influence to bear on the government before it is too late so that it will make the changes that are needed. As I was saying before Senator Burns interrupted, it is no wonder, with that lack of growth in labour productivity, that our standard of living has fallen under this Labor government or that real wages have gone backwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity improvement requires that an employer and his employees develop a shared vision for the business on which they are all dependent. It requires an end to the `us and them' mentality, which has bedevilled Australian industrial relations for a century and which is fostered by trade unions, because they know that that is the only way they can remain relevant. The introduction of genuine voluntary agreements through enterprise bargaining, without the unilateral right of uninvited third parties to be involved, is the best way of achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But all we get from this union dominated government is the use of award flexibility provisions for workplace bargaining. In other words, under these proposals, enterprise agreements will only be allowed as the equivalent of over-award payments. This could best be described as a Claytons enterprise agreement, because it is certainly not the real thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While non-union members will be able to achieve such deals, which they are currently prevented from achieving, they will still have to be approved by the Industrial Relations Commission. Also, uninvited by the particular workers involved, trade unions will have the right to argue before the Industrial Relations Commission that the deal should not be approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed system is highly complex. It is no way to get real change in the workplace. Changing workplace arrangements will require weeks and months of negotiation, a process of detailed bureaucratic and quasi-legal procedures and compliance with finely detailed legal requirements. Nineteen separate tests will be required to be passed, with the trade union agreeing before employees and their employer can make a deal about their working arrangements in, for example, a small business, perhaps in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, or anywhere else for that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have greater complexity, if that is possible, with various layers of awards and agreements and apparently different procedures applying to each. This is a recipe for confusion and the creation of a burden on employers that will effectively prevent many of them achieving enterprise agreements. No doubt this is what the union troglodytes hope will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package clearly enhances the position of trade unions and makes employers more vulnerable. It will certainly not encourage employers to take on additional employees. Surely that ought to be a major aim of any changes to industrial relations and its structures in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing system has delivered 11 per cent unemployment. One million Australians are unsuccessfully seeking work and many more are discouraged from even looking. These changes will do nothing to arrest that tragedy. Indeed, they will make it worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the external affairs power, as provided in the legislation to come before us, not only breaks new ground in Australia but also clearly demonstrates the incapacity of the federal government to work with state governments to achieve sensible progress on industrial relations reform. That is central to our motion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not ironic that, at the very time Prime Minister Keating is bleating loudest about the need for Australia to assert its independence by becoming a republic, he is handing unprecedented control over the lives of ordinary Australians to the International Labour Organisation and its conventions? Senator Kemp, only last night in this chamber, highlighted a number of fields in which this abdication of our independence to international bodies and conventions linked with the United Nations is being fostered by the Keating government. He documented that quite clearly. It undermines the whole of the government's argument for a republic. Industrial relations is just another example of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is simply not interested in genuine consultation with anyone except its union mates. As with the business sector and employers earlier, last Friday's meeting between the federal Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and the state industrial relations ministers was designed to give the appearance of consultation. But the reality of consultation was not there. It was all a facade. At their April meeting, all states offered to talk and work with the federal government to reach agreement for national uniformity, particularly with regard to minimum employment standards, in the development of this industrial relations package. But this government is having none of that. Instead, it has adopted threats and a big stick approach in ignoring legitimate concerns expressed by the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest failing, among many, of the Hawke-Keating Labor governments is their failure to deregulate the labour market while deregulating other aspects of our economy. The government and trade unions must accept that, if the standard of living of all Australians is to improve and we are to climb back up the international ladder as far as our standard of living is concerned, productivity must improve. That requires a new approach to industrial relations as we enter the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structures that we currently have, which are based on 19th century experience and thinking and on an industrial relations culture largely based on the judgments of Higgins early this century, simply will not do. That is why the government's proposed package will not do and that is why this motion moved by Senator Crane, which particularly highlights the legitimate concerns expressed by those state ministers, ought to be supported. I certainly wholeheartedly support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to take up much of the Senate's time with respect to this motion because it is not worthy of taking up much time; nor are the statements that have been made by Senator Crane in support of his motion, backed up by Senator Chapman. However, I cannot really let it go unaddressed. Let us look at the motion which purports to represent state ministers. It is funny; it seems to have left out two states&mdash;Queensland and South Australia. It mentions only those states with Liberal governments. Those particular states have a really good record in the area of consultation. We only have to look at the state industrial relations legislation introduced in New South Wales, followed by Victoria, to demonstrate just how democratic those Liberal governments really are in the area of consultation with workers and, in fact, with anybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go straight to the question of consultation, which is the crux of the issues raised by Senator Crane, who says that both the government and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) never consulted with the states or, indeed, with any of the employer representatives or organisations around this country. The Prime Minister announced on 2 December 1992 that the government would legislate to guarantee workers' rights to fair minimum wages, equal pay for work of equal value, and protection against unfair dismissal. This legislation was to be based on relevant International Labour Organisation conventions using the external affairs powers of the constitution. These issues were discussed at a meeting of state premiers in Perth later in December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, convened a special Ministers of Labour meeting on 16 December 1992 to provide state ministers with more detail of the proposed legislation. The legislation was again discussed at the Ministers of Labour Advisory Council&mdash;MOLAC&mdash;meeting in Brisbane on 30 April 1993. State ministers were given an assurance that they would have an opportunity to comment on the legislation before it was introduced into the parliament. State department of labour officials were given a detailed briefing on the legislation by officials of the minister's department on 8 September 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brereton wrote to all state ministers on 14 October providing a copy of the latest draft of the minimum entitlements legislation. This was to ensure that the states had sufficient time to examine the legislation before the MOLAC meeting on 22 October. Minister Brereton again wrote to state ministers on 19 October advising of the latest changes to the legislation. In addition to that, he has had individual meetings with all state ministers and there have been exchanges of correspondence with state ministers during the development of the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations has had extensive consultations with the state ministers on the development of the industrial relations legislation since the process began, essentially, in April 1993. By way of example, the minister has had nine meetings with the ACTU's negotiating committee over this period. This compares with 16 separate meetings with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, and the Metal Trades Industry Association. More than 100 separate meetings have been held with employers, the states, unions and interest groups. I would like honourable senators to compare that with what happened in the Liberal states when they introduced their industrial relations legislation&mdash;zilch to 100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's reforms essentially provide for a framework for the further spread of enterprise bargaining throughout the Australian economy. I pick up on what Senator Chapman said about the small business people. The small business people I have spoken to essentially believe that there ought to be the maintenance of an award system, simply because that is the easiest way for them to operate. They may never seek an enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one fundamental difference between our position and that of the coalition at the last election was that those opposite were going to do away with the award system, as has happened in Victoria. They want to pay young people under the age of 21 three bucks an hour; that is really good for the economy, really good for jobs. Many people whose children were attending tertiary education and working part-time came to me and told me just how their children would manage to get by on three bucks an hour&mdash;they would not have been able to do it. They would have had to have discontinued their education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's proposals build on the reforms of the last decade. They allow Australian workplaces to implement cooperatively and constructively the changes needed to compete with the best companies in the world. The legislation provides employers with the flexibility they need to improve productivity and compete internationally while recognising&mdash;a very fundamental point&mdash;that employee protection is crucial to the success of enterprise bargaining. Nothing that Senator Crane or Senator Chapman said reflected that. They said that we have to free up the labour market and make real change. What does real change mean to those on the other side of the fence? It means cutting wages and making sure the boss has the upper hand and has the whip over his workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation clearly distinguishes between the bargaining stream, where an increasing number of workplaces will determine their actual wages and conditions and the arbitrated award safety net. Again, there is a substantial difference here between what the government proposes and what was, and is, proposed by the coalition where we would have no award safety net&mdash;none. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very true. The statements of Senator Chapman and Senator Crane make it correct, otherwise the opposition's position must have changed. The legislation revises the current regulation of industrial action to ensure that there is a fair and effective regime, recognising the particular requirements of enterprise bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the legislation provides strong safeguards to ensure that the increasing emphasis on the workplace is not at the expense of wages and conditions of ordinary Australian workers. In particular, it strengthens the award safety net for employees and ensures that all workers in Australia have access to key minimum entitlements required by international conventions which apply to Australia, and it maintains a `no disadvantage' test for employees moving to enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane raised the issue of requiring 50 per cent plus one before there can be an enterprise agreement. I find it interesting that he condemned that particular aspect of the legislation when he seeks to champion the New South Wales state government and its legislation. Perhaps if he had done a bit of checking he would have found out that the New South Wales legislation requires 65 per cent of people at the workplace to agree with any proposal for an enterprise agreement before it can be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the situation in Victoria where we have no award system and public holidays are taken away; we know exactly what the process is there. It gives us a clear indication of what the coalition's real position is on industrial relations. The workers did not vote for it last time and they will not vote for it in the future. Some time ago the employers made very substantial statements about commencing a campaign of advertising, et cetera, against this legislation. I noticed in the newspapers either yesterday or today that they will have a further meeting to consider their position with respect to any advertising campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must reiterate the types of proposals that the coalition took to the last election and put before the Australian working people. It proposed that people under the age of 21 be paid $3 an hour. Quite frankly, that would have been a disaster for the economy and for employment. Had the coalition won government, we would have had a system that would have seen workers competing for jobs. People would have had to tender for a job.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of sections 45D and 45E has been going on for a long time. It was clearly the majority view of the committee that inquired into it that it has been used as a big stick and as a punitive measure against workers pursuing their legitimate rights. It is now going to be put in its right place&mdash;that is, in the Industrial Relations Act. That is where it should be dealt with because it is clearly a much fairer way of dealing with the legitimate rights of workers to pursue the issues that are important to them, such as their working conditions. It also provides protection for workers who may well be in a situation where the Industrial Relations Commission is not able to settle the issue. The 72-hour issue is, quite frankly, a very fair proposal. If we looked at all of the disputes that have happened over the time of the Industrial Relations Act, we would find that in many instances, even in the case of actions under sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, they have been resolved outside 72 hours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support Senator Crane's motion. Irrespective of the flowery words of people such as Senator Murphy, this government is seeking to entrench union power in the hands of a few union heavies&mdash;no more, no less.

That is totally dishonest&mdash;the normal way the trade union movement operates in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that everyone is aware of is that 70 per cent of people in the private sector are not union members, and they do not want to be. In my lifetime I have worked in all areas of the economy. I have worked in non-union shops and I had my own business at one time where a number of employees were union members and they continued to be union members because they were in a trade where they required a union ticket if they wanted to go back to it. They had to go back to a closed shop. It was the ultimate lack of freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should tell Senator Murphy what our policy does. It simply entrenches the right of individual Australians within this society to decide whether they want to be a union member or whether they want to resign. I would have thought that that was a basic freedom that a democratic country such as Australia desired. What is the government frightened of? Why are the unions frightened? Why is the government entrenching union power? If it was good enough, people would willingly join. There is nothing more coercive and more of an attack on the freedom of individuals in this country than a closed shop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the claims of honourable senators opposite&mdash;the union apparatchiks&mdash;the other day. I do not want to name them because I might be wrong; it might have been Senator Burns. They were saying that union membership was not compulsory. What a joke! This is what the whole enterprise bargaining system is about. The so-called free enterprise bargaining of the non-unionised sector is saying, `Yes, you can apply for an enterprise agreement but we are going to get a union heavy there and if he doesn't like it, he will have the power of veto'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Murphy were genuine about doing the right thing by the 70 per cent of people who do not want to be members of unions, he would facilitate their ability to make an agreement with their own employer on the basis that the relationship between an employer and employee is important. They know that if they are successful and their business is successful their jobs will be secure, rather than the opposite, which would occur under the government. But they do not want that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech Senator Murphy said that Queensland was not mentioned. I was delighted to hear him say that. Senator Burns will attest to the fact that about 80 or 90 per cent of the employees of the Metway Bank in Queensland decided they wanted to have an enterprise agreement with their management. What happened? The unions put on the greatest stunt we have seen in our lives. They demanded that there be union representation. They tried to get them pushed into the federal jurisdiction, as honourable senators opposite are probably aware. They tried every trick in the book. The members themselves hung out because they knew they could get a better deal. The Metway Bank then came under sustained attack by the monkeys in Queensland&mdash;the members of the Labor Party&mdash;at the request of the organ grinders in the trade union movement who said, `You've got to get Metway because it will not allow the unions to participate in this process'. </PARA>

Mr Hawke said to Mr Howard that there would be blood on the streets. Of course there was not blood on the streets. What happened with the passage of time was that sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act became a deterrent to militant unions taking secondary and primary boycott action. That is exactly what happened. </PARA>

It was interesting that only about a month ago his union decided to pull every coal miner in Australia out on strike. They went on strike because they did not like the price that BHP was getting for coal being exported to Turkey. Every coal miner in Australia went on strike. I was contacted by miners from the Hunter Valley and from the Bowen Basin, which is in my state. They said to me, `We do not know why we are on strike, but we are going on strike because the union leaders told us to'. </PARA>

The coal miners were pulled out against their will, production was down, our reputation as an overseas supplier suffered yet again and the union decided it would not have a four-day strike, it would have a three-day strike. I understand that the companies have withdrawn the section 45D and 45E process and have not proceeded with the damages, but it was there as a deterrent. That decision was made on 20 August. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Deputy President has made his ruling. Historically the trade unions have played a role in society because of the dictatorial attitudes of employers. They had to come into existence to protect the rights of employees, were given pretty poor wages and unsafe and unhealthy working conditions. So the unions had to come into existence to protect people in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been years of struggle with the gradual building of awards and minimum wages and a safer and healthier working environment. This was done through confrontation with employers. Since the election of the Labor government we have had an accord&mdash;an accord which those opposite said would not work.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crane says, `What about the employers?' The employers were invited to be involved in the first place. They opposed any such agreement and did not want to be involved. So that is the answer to Senator Crane's query.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to answer some criticisms that have been made by Senator Parer. He talked about compulsory unionism. It is true that in some awards there is preference to unionists at the point of engagement and at the point of dismissal, but certainly not during the period of employment. There is no law which says that someone should be in an union, but it is also true that there are certain agreements in some workplaces where people are expected to join the union and, indeed, give an undertaking to do so voluntarily when they join that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had experience in these matters; no-one on the other side of the chamber has. I recall going to a metal workshop in Brisbane. I sought to convince people that it was in their interests to join a union. Those workers said that they did not want to join the union, that they had a good employer and that they were happy the way they were. So I left the workshop. There was no further action or no further request made to them. But six months later, when that employer behaved badly towards them, they rang the union office and asked to become members. I went out there and, on their behalf, took up the problems they had and I was able to solve them. Those people are members of that union today. </PARA>

<PARA>then the employer shall not discriminate. It is very clear: there will be no discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Parer also talked about job creation and unemployment reduction. These are quite different in this day and age because while many hundreds of thousands jobs have been created in recent years, they have not reduced the unemployment level for some time because of increased productivity, better management practices and better technology. So, creating jobs does not guarantee any reduction in unemployment. I have not heard anyone talking about labour costs being a problem. That is probably because labour costs in European countries and Japan, for instance, are much higher than they are in Australia. In fact, we are in a fairly competitive position. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of consultation, if the brains of those opposite were working as efficiently as they should be, they would realise that coalition state governments are ideologically opposed to the trade union movement and the federal Labor government has sympathy with the interests of trade union members and workers in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not reasonable for some people to consult on some matters about which they are diametrically opposed. For instance, I point to the introduction of individual contracts by the National Party government in Queensland. If it was prepared to consult with the trade unions or with the federal government, it would have been on the basis of did they want to be hung, and just how high and on what day. The National Party just brought that legislation into law against the wishes of the trade union movement and it would certainly have been against the wishes of the federal Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite talk about consultation. Did Jeff Kennett consult people when he took two statutory holidays off workers in Victoria? Did he consult people on his current laws on industrial relations? No, he did not; he moved unilaterally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were having a confrontation position&mdash;which Senator Crane's motion suggests should continue&mdash;other countries were developing better attitudes to industrial relations.

The trade unions would certainly have preferred to do it in other ways and, indeed, moved to an accord at the first opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other countries were able to build their economies based on the fact that they repressed trade union activity and made it illegal. Those countries were able to utilise and exploit their work force. Even in those countries, as they have become more prosperous and their economies have grown, wages have risen and conditions have improved, which has given them fewer advantages when competing for economic trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not rooted in the past, as has been suggested by those opposite. The trade union movement wants to look at new ideas, but we want to do it on the basis of equality. We want to see a situation where negotiations are carried out in good faith and are not backed up on one side by penalties that create a situation within which those people who do not want to negotiate meaningfully can say, `To hell with the workers. If they go on strike we'll use penalties against them. We'll use the law against them. Why should we negotiate?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If somebody asked a reasonable question about the future policy of the company, costings or other management issues, those employers would say, `That's our business. That's a management prerogative. Why should you know? Why should we tell you anything? It is an interference in management'. We want a situation where employers are prepared to tell people where the company is going and what its policy is, so that in negotiation the trade unions can make an objective decision that we believe would be in the interests of both parties and also the public interest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this bill follows on from the changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 which were passed by the Parliament during the Autumn Sittings earlier this year and more recently at the commencement of the current Budget Sittings. It gives effect to the remaining major changes to the Act that are necessary to implement the totality of the reform package flowing from the Commission's review of the operation of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in this bill, together with those which have already received Assent, establish a leaner, tighter and more effective organisation, with devolved decision making going hand-in-hand with improved accountability. As a result ATSIC's ability to provide a vehicle for indigenous self determination becomes even more firmly established. As we have seen in the last few weeks that means ATSIC's evolution as an organisation able not only to manage Commonwealth programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities but also to negotiate on policy with an independent and forceful political voice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides, in essence, for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">major changes to arrangements for the Torres Strait, including the establishment of a Torres Strait Regional Authority (TSRA);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">streamlining the financial provisions of the Act, one of the effects of which will be to facilitate the further devolution of authority to Regional Councils;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">strengthening the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">establishing an independent Electoral Review Panel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will recall that when the second package of amendments was introduced at the commencement of the current Sittings, it was foreshadowed that a further bill encompassing these further reforms would be introduced during these Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This third package of amendments, like those introduced earlier this year, flow from recommendations contained in the Commission's report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the operation of the Act. These amendments, which build on the reforms already agreed to by Parliament, will further enhance the representative nature of the organisation, strengthen the role of the Regional Councils as the linchpins of empowerment for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and reinforce the Commission's established commitment to high standards of scrutiny and accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms are based on the Government's commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self determination and our confidence in indigenous people managing their own  affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the major provisions of the present bill and in doing so I draw to the Senate's attention that the bill is large and it is not possible to set out in great detail many of the changes. Those that are of a substantive nature I will deal with more fully.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Office of Evaluation and Audit</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill substantially widens the powers of the Office of Evaluation and Audit, increasing the ability of the Minister and the Commission to have examined the financial management of ATSIC funded organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It provides for an expansion in the functions of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include the evaluation and audit of the operations of Aboriginal Hostels Limited, the Commercial Development Corporation, and the proposed Torres Strait Regional Authority as well as the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, the bill includes provision to enable the Minister and the Commission to direct the Office of Evaluation and Audit to investigate the operations of Regional Councils, in addition to the above bodies, and in certain cases, ATSIC and TSRA grant and loan recipients. Provision is also made for the Director of Evaluation and Audit to have greater powers to examine documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes a number of clauses relating to the Director of Evaluation and Audit amendments including provision for the period of appointment, remuneration and allowances, leave of absence, disclosure of interests, resignation, termination of appointment of the Director of Evaluation and Audit, aligning these with similar provisions for other full time statutory officer holders under the Principal Act. Provision is also made for an acting Director and for the Director to be immune from personal liability in an action or other proceeding for damages in relation to anything done in his/her official capacity. These provisions are largely administrative in nature and serve to correct an anomaly in the existing Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chief Executive Officer</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the period of appointment of the Chief Executive Officer by setting a maximum period of appointment rather than a minimum. This is in accordance with standard appointment provisions in most legislation establishing statutory appointments. It also requires the CEO to report his/her interests to the Commission Chairperson rather than the full Board of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advisory Committees</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes amendments relating to membership of Advisory Committees and the members of the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board. The amendments include provisions for the  disclosure of interests at meetings, resignations, and termination of the members of these bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments relating to Regional Council Administrators</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is made in the bill to set the terms and conditions for an Administrator to hold office. This was omitted from the Principal Act and is largely an administrative matter. The provisions include full-time appointment consistent with the move to full time Regional Council Chairpersons, disclosure of interests, resignation, leave of absence, and suspension and termination of appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the Government's commitment to greater self determination and self management, provision has been made for the Commission rather than the Minister to appoint Administrators. Provision is also made for an acting Administrator and for the Commission to appoint a replacement Administrator if there is a vacancy in an office of the Administrator.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial Development Corporation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of amendments relating to the CDC. These are largely technical in nature and tidy up the Principal Act to bring it more into line with current drafting procedures. The bill provides for at least one Director to be an ATSIC Commissioner, for the period of appointments not to exceed five years, and for the termination of appointment of  a Director of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes provision for exempting ATSIC from the payment of excise duty which would otherwise be payable by the Commission, or by any other person, on goods that are for use by the Commission. The current arrangement whereby ATSIC is required to pay excise duty is inconsistent with other Government agencies and it is only reasonable that the Act be amended to bring the organisation into line with other Commonwealth Departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal Hostels Limited</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that AHL is not a statutory organisation established under the Principal Act, but a company funded through ATSIC. The Government considers that it is essential that AHL be subject to the same level of scrutiny and accountability and to the same administrative review mechanisms as ATSIC. Provisions are included in the bill to this end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will note that the bill before them includes provision for Division 2 of Part XI of the Audit Act 1901 to apply to Aboriginal Hostels Limited and that certain decisions of an administrative character made at the Director level are made subject to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secrecy Provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interests of privacy and in recognition of the very sensitive personal information that may become available to certain office holders within ATSIC, the Government has agreed with the Commission's proposal that section 90 of the Principal Act be extended to apply to the Director of Evaluation and Audit, a member of the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board, a Regional Councillor, a member of an Advisory Committee established under section 96 and an Administrator. It will also extend the secrecy provisions to the Torres Strait Regional Authority when it commences on 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional Council Estimates Processes and Reporting Requirements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes provisions to strengthen the annual reporting requirements of Regional Councils. As a result of the proposed amendments Regional Councils will be obliged to provide to the Commission an Annual Report dealing with the operations of the Regional Council during the year, the implementation during that year of the Regional Plan, details of grants made from Regional Council budgets during the year and any other matters relating to that year as the Commission determines in writing. The Annual Report and Regional Plan are required to be made available for inspection and purchase by residents of the Region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, provision is made in the bill to require Regional Councils to have regard to their Regional Plans when preparing their Draft Budgets. This linkage is considered necessary because of the increased powers which Regional Councils will have over the disbursement of Commission funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes provision for a number of changes to the power of delegation under the Principal Act. Some of the changes relate to administrative matters. I refer in particular to the proposal to enable the Commission to delegate to the Director of Evaluation and Audit its powers for the appointment of Consultants under Section 56 and also to enable the Chief Executive Officer power to sub-delegate functions or powers to a member of the staff of the Commission. However the more important aspect of the amendments relates to the enhanced responsibilities given to Regional Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the key recommendations of the Commission in its report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs was the need for greater empowerment of Regional Councils. The bill provides for the Commission to delegate to a Regional Council its powers to approve funds and issue guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These powers are not unfettered. It is important that Honourable Senators note that these delegated powers will be subject to any written directions by the Commission and are accompanied by sanctions to protect the interests of the Government, ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Provision is also made to empower the Commission Chairperson to suspend delegations to Regional Councils in certain cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General Funding Powers</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another of the key recommendations of the Commission was the need to simplify funding powers of the Commission. This bill spells out the new and simplified arrangements.  I must reiterate to Honourable Senators that it is neither the Commission's nor the Government's intention to in any way water down accountability requirements either to the Parliament or to  the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whom the Commission represents. Indeed the effect of the amendments is to enhance that accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned, however, over the current complex and inflexible provisions and propose that they be amended to enable the Commission to more successfully fulfil the functions imposed upon it by the principal Act. As the Government has stated on a number of occasions, true self-determination is fundamental to the success of the Commission and it is in pursuit of this that these amendments are put before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In essence the changes enable the Commission to make a grant of money or grant an interest in land or grant an interest in personal property or make a loan of money to any body corporate or unincorporated organisation. In certain cases this power extends to individuals. Regional Councils and the Torres Strait Regional Authority cannot be recipients. This provision is accompanied by a requirement that such grants, loans and guarantees may only be made for the purpose of furthering the social, economic or cultural development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For purposes of enhanced scrutiny the bill also requires the Commission to formulate decision making principles about the giving of grants, loans and guarantees. Funding must only be made in accordance with these decision making principles. The Chief Executive Officer must cause a notice of the making of decision making principles to be published in the Gazette. He must also ensure that copies of the decision making principles which are in force are given to each Regional Council and are available for inspection and purchase at each of the Commission's offices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporate Plan</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the important technical amendments which the Commission has suggested is the need to remove the direct link between the Commission's Corporate Plan and the procedures for the engagement of Consultants. The bill proposes that this link be severed. Instead, the Commission will be required to set out the criteria and standard terms and conditions for the engagement of Consultants by way of written instrument and to notify the making of the instrument in the Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff and Consultants</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the second amending bill passed earlier in these sittings wards were created for the purposes of electing Regional Councillors. This present bill includes consequent provisions which prohibit a member of the staff of the Commission or a Consultant to the Commission standing for election, or being elected, as a member for a Regional Council Ward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Draft Budgets</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for simplification of the draft budget, and  the estimates processes involved, for both the Commission and Regional Councils. Consistent with the proposed streamlining of funding provisions, the bill reduces the number of elements required in the Commission's estimates of expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally important, the bill facilitates a greater devolution of funding to Regional Council budgets by enabling the Commission to earmark elements of Regional Council allocations for particular purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of Regional Councils</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have mentioned earlier, both the Commission and the Government wish to maintain and enhance the accountability requirements. Included in this bill are amendments which strengthen the responsibility of the Commission and Regional Councils. The bill provides for the Commission to remove Regional Councils from office in certain situations.  These include the Regional Council's failure to perform its functions, failure to comply with the Draft Budgets requirements, failure to meet the Annual Reporting requirement, or contravention of a delegation from the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions require that, before this power is invoked, the Commission must provide the Regional Council with a notice setting out the reasons for its proposed course of action and giving 28 days in which to show cause why the Regional Councillors should not be removed. It is hoped that any dispute in connection with these matters can be resolved within the 28 day period and that it will not be necessary to remove the Regional Councillors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also made for an appointment of an Administrator to administer the affairs of the Regional Council where the Regional Councillors have been removed from office. It is the intention of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to make Election Rules to provide for a by-election to be held within a period of twelve months from the date that a Regional Council is removed under the new section 123A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions relating to Torres Strait Islanders</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is perhaps one of the most significant changes proposed in the bill. The Government is taking up the Commission's recommendation that the Torres Strait region be dealt with separately from other Regions and has included in the bill clauses establishing a Torres Strait Regional Authority. This Authority will supersede the Torres Strait Regional Council. This section of the bill is quite lengthy and I ask that Honourable Senators study it carefully as it is a significant demonstration of the Government's commitment to the empowerment of one of Australia's two distinct indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In effect this will give significantly greater powers and impose significantly higher levels of accountability upon the Torres Strait body. The Torres Strait Regional Authority will  now have powers and functions similar to those enjoyed by the Commission in relation to indigenous people in the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Independent Review Panel</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As foreshadowed by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs when he introduced the ATSIC Amendment Bill No. 2 earlier in the current sittings this bill contains a further major reform in the establishment of an independent electoral review process. The Review Panel established by this bill will have two distinct functions, firstly to review and determine the boundaries of the regions and wards and the grouping of regions into zones, and secondly to review and report to the Minister on the electoral systems established by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the review of boundaries is concerned, the panel will call for submissions from interested persons and make draft boundary recommendations. An augmented review panel will then consider appeals against the draft boundary recommendations and make final boundary recommendations. The Minister will be required to give effect to the final boundary recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The boundary review process is modelled on the redistribution committees established by the Australian Electoral Act and is designed to ensure that the panel and the augmented panel are not only independent and objective but are seen to be independent and objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this final package of reforms gives effect to the remaining aspects of the major changes to the Act contained in the Commission's Review Report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the operation of the Act. I am aware that the bill is quite a complex one, ranging from minor technical amendments to fairly significant changes. As a whole it fulfils the Government's commitment to implement the Commission's recommendations in relation to the operation of ATSIC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering this legislation at a time when, for various historical reasons, the wool industry is probably in the trough of the worst depression it has ever known. The legislation which we have before us is an attempt by the government to try to improve that position and, with some reservations, I believe that it is a step in the right direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool recession conditions, particularly among some of our biggest wool customers such as Russia and China, mean that the demand for wool during the last two or three years has not been as high as previous levels. However, medium- and long-term predictions for demand indicate that demand for the product will be reasonable. When we take into account that income growth in developing countries, especially in cold climate countries such as China, Turkey and Korea, will be considerable in the next decade, there is a great opportunity for the marketing and promotion of this great fibre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to rephrase the arguments put forward by my coalition colleagues for the adoption of this legislation. As a woolgrower, I must declare my interest in this debate, but as a patriotic Australian I must also declare my interest in the promulgation of soundly based principles to help put the industry back on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of Wool International has already been described by previous speakers. It is hoped that the intention of the government to make this a strongly commercially oriented organisation will be carried through in practice. It is also to be hoped that the commercial flavour of Wool International will compensate for the drop in funding for promotion and that every effort will be made by the authorities involved to expand the international trade in wool and wool products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to discuss further the details of the major issues contained in the legislation, but I would wish to place on record that, after many lengthy discussions with woolgrowers in my own state of Victoria and after hearing the thoughtful statements presented by those who participated in the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs last Friday, some further points should be noted. The industry has been in the doldrums now for at least the last two years, and in a state of heightened and unrealistic expectation for longer than that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations made in the Garnaut report and the legislation emanating from it point the way towards a better structure for the sale and marketing of wool. With the eventual privatisation of Wool International, government will be removed from the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of a fixed release schedule of wool from the stockpile has also provoked a great deal of discussion. At this stage, it is impossible to forecast whether the amount will be too much, and further depress demand, or too little so that it would not be possible to satisfy potential customer demand. If it were possible to forecast future events in market movement, the debate today would not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, there are real concerns about whether demand will go up or down and the effect of that movement on prices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of bills is a reflection of the increasing and continuing difficulties being experienced in the wool industry right across Australia and, to an extent, around the world. Wool has always enjoyed a special position in the hearts and minds of all Australians and for years the claim that Australia was riding to success on the back of our sheep industry was as popular as it was true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is the largest wool producing country in the world and is also the largest exporter. Our production accounts for 30 per cent of the world production and just under 60 per cent of all exports of wool. Over the last 50 years, sheep numbers and wool production have fluctuated due to a range of factors. Prices have moved similarly, moving as low as 354c a kilo in 1970 and something like 690c a kilo in 1987-88. Let us not forget the floor price of 870c a kilo just prior to the big crash at the end of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1980s will long be remembered as some of the most heady years in the history of wool. Demand was strong and the reserve price scheme was in operation and climbing and few stopped to think that it would ever collapse. Indeed, just prior to the series of events that ultimately saw the collapse and the removal of the reserve price scheme in 1990, ABARE was advising growers at its 1989 outlook conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While wool prices have receded from the record levels of last April, they are projected to remain relatively high into the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA>That was only three years ago. It was only three years ago that we debated what we thought then was the most difficult piece of legislation affecting the industry. I said in the Senate during the debate that the words spoken in this chamber would long be forgotten while the impact of what has been decided lives on. I said then that the stockpile was overhanging the market and that we must have a look to our consumers. These sentiments apply also to the legislation before us today. This package of eight bills may well be as momentous and as history making as the collapse of the reserve price scheme was in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History will record that this legislation is supported by all the major parties. I hope history also records that as legislators we had to do what we thought collectively was best at the time and that, like ABARE, we are not infallible. The Senate, quite appropriately in my view, referred this package of bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for review. It did that notwithstanding that the legislation was not opposed. By doing so, it reflected a concern both within and outside this place about aspects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That opposition and concern was well highlighted in the hearings last Friday when representatives of growers, processors, marketers and exporters came and put their views to the committee. Those views could best be summarised as caution about the role of Wool International, the buyback provisions of Wool International and the fixed disposal schedule. Given that time is short, I will keep my remarks brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wool International Bill establishes a fixed schedule for the disposal of the stockpile by Wool International. The Wool Council of Australia, representing growers, is very happy with this. It supports a fixed schedule because it sees real benefits in it. Professor Garnaut told our committee last Friday that he supported a fixed schedule and was opposed to a minimum schedule because it removed any possibility of an upside, which a fixed schedule provides. DPIE also supported a fixed schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposing such an arrangement was Dr Lionel Ward of the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers. He rejected the view that a fixed disposal schedule offered certainty of supply. He was supported by the International Wool Textile Organisation which suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the worst of all systems is a fixed quantity disposal policy which is implemented in October 1993, starts in July 1994 and cannot be changed for three years.</PARA>
<PARA>Don Booth from the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a fixed disposal schedule will not lead to certainty in the market, but rather will lead to greater price volatility.</PARA>
<PARA>In all of this, it is essential to remember that while Australia can produce wool better than anyone else, it matters little if we cannot sell it better than anyone else. As Sir William Gunn, the one-time chairman of the Australian Wool Board and the International Wool Secretariat, said in 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say as strongly as I possibly can that no marketing system will survive, it doesn't matter how efficient it is, if there is not an adequate demand at the consumer level for the product you are trying to sell . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Lionel Ward reiterated these sentiments last Friday in response to one of my questions, `Can you regulate the market?'. His reply was, `No, you cannot'. That is the crux of the matter and the crux of the dilemma. On all sides you have well-informed, well-intentioned people offering a view. Time alone will tell who is right. My concern is that growers should be aware that this legislation will not alone save the industry from further pain, that actions of the 1980s and the impact of other world events outside the control of Australia must have a consequential reaction and those consequences will be seen during the next few years as we try to get wool production and selling back to a more profitable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a part to play in this. It must get the infrastructure of our economy right&mdash;the infrastructure in terms of our transport, our waterfront and all the other imposts government puts on the farming community. Just look at what the government did to fuel in the last budget. It has put up the cost of fuel, which will put up the cost of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agricultural consultants take a pessimistic view of the proposed outcomes for wool as seen by the Garnaut report. They make the point that the supply-demand situation will remain for the foreseeable future&mdash;in the next year or two&mdash;which will not give the growers the price increase they need to stay in a sustainable position in the industry. They also worry that at the end of the period the wool industry will not have enough supplies to supply the consumer, which might mean that some people in the processing area will turn to synthetics. As I said earlier, only time will tell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My recent trip to Europe, on which I spoke with various wool processors, brought home to me again and again that the industry must become more commercial in its approach by developing a more market driven response to consumer demands. We have to do a lot more with research; we have to do a lot more with promotion. With our research we must work to make sure that we can have a wool which can be sold to a consumer that is not prickly, that is washable and that can be tumbled dry. All those things that the researchers have done something about already have come through, but are they affordable for the end user?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report, as Senator Troeth said a moment ago, is a report that has gone into the industry in depth. It also suggests a similar goal as far as those consumer demands and research and promotion are concerned. My concern is that the whole matter is a complex one and that, frankly, we cannot afford to get it wrong. Instability is a deathtrap for any product and any industry&mdash;and wool is no exception. As stated in a paper by Hassall and Associates, a firm of farm consultants:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an urgent need for all political parties to recognise the impact of the frequent changes to wool regulations on the level of uncertainty in the market and that increased uncertainty leads to lower wool prices. Most importantly, future changes should be contemplated only if they facilitate improved marketing, including development of the newly emerging private wool marketing and processing organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>These bills and the amendments which have been suggested by the coalition are designed to strengthen and make the industry much more stable. To quote one last time from our report&mdash;and I know that Senator Crane had some input into this part, as did the rest of the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee urges the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to consult fully with the industry on the further development of Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee urges the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to give further consideration to the Government's position on the future funding of wool promotion.</PARA>
<PARA>That is very important. Let us hope the minister takes it on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the buck stops with the growers. Their representative, the Wool Council of Australia, has endorsed these bills as being the right formula for the industry. On that basis, it is not for us as politicians to ignore those wishes; indeed, it is imperative that we listen to them. It is their industry and their financial future at stake. I congratulate John Anderson, the shadow minister for primary industry, for the amount of work he did in listening to grower groups all over Australia and for the way in which he consulted with the industry. On that basis, I support this package of bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is what I hope will be the last debate that we have on wool. We certainly have been having them regularly over the last 2 1/2 years. I think, if we were to read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, we would see very accurately chronicled what has happened to the wool industry. The wool industry was faced with the economic recession which affected the whole world with high interest rates. But, as well as high interest rates and the price crash, it also had a drought to contend with in most areas of this country&mdash;and that probably was just the icing on the cake that was not needed in the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before us tonight we see the results of what is commonly called the Garnaut report. This is a report commissioned earlier this year by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). It is a result of consultation that was undertaken by the members of the Garnaut committee. The committee received in excess of 120 submissions from individuals and organisations. That is a very good level of consultation to commence with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Garnaut report's publication, there were consultations. We have heard tonight that Mr Anderson, the honourable member for Gwydir, the shadow spokesman on primary industry, went around and consulted with various wool growing groups and organisations and those in the industry right across Australia. Also we must not forget the consultations which were undertaken by the Minister and his staff with all the interested and involved parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was privileged to participate in one of the consultative meetings which the minister undertook in Dubbo. The contribution on those members of the industry who participated was excellent. It was a well considered discussion. They presented well considered arguments and reasons why they supported the Garnaut report. They were not necessarily happy with everything that was going to happen and how tough it was going to be for them in the next little while, but they were very realistic about the future of their industry and what they had to do to work towards the future&mdash;because it does have a future and they recognised that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We met people from a very wide cross-section of New South Wales&mdash;from the area that Senator Brownhill comes from, around Quirindi and places such as that in the northern tablelands, down into the western plains south and west of Dubbo. So it was a wide cross-section in geographic terms and also in terms of the interests which those people represented, from the Merino Breeders Association through to ordinary members of grazing organisations&mdash;ordinary, average woolgrowers who do not have studs or the elite line. So we saw a good cross-section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This consultation was very important in enabling the government to prepare the legislation and in enabling the minister to take it to cabinet for approval. We have seen consultation continue as well. We have heard tonight about the opposition amendments. Of course they were moved following consultation with the opposition, the government and the industry; they were actually moved by the minister in the lower house. So they have become the government amendments. They were amendments which were made and passed unanimously. That has been a very important aspect of this legislation. There is being given to the outside world a vision and a confirmation of unanimity of purpose; that there is agreement on the aspects of this legislation; that the government is wanting to portray certainty and stability to the industry, the buyers of this product&mdash;and that is of vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly have heard people talking about the schedule. I personally favour very strongly a fixed schedule because it gives people an indication and certainty of what the supply coming out of that stockpile will be. We know that the markets are very sensitive to a number of factors, but I think one of the areas&mdash;and we must never forget it&mdash;is that supply sensitivity is of crucial importance in this industry. Prices can be hedged against in the futures markets. With supply sensitivity the manufacturing industry has to know what will be available so that it can do some forward planning, and this legislation will make that possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the price side, I have not seen any major price differentiations or fluctuations in the commodities, in the garments that we actually buy. It has not mattered that the price of wool has been at 900c a kilo or at 350c a kilo. It has not made any difference to the price the consumer is paying. Therefore, to me, the price side is not as important as the actual maintaining of very keen and very careful certainty in the supply side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me also, the most important group in this industry is the growers, the producers. They are the ones who are bearing most of the price sensitivity. If their prices are not good enough, if they are not making enough money from their wool to live, they are going to be forced out of the industry and that is going to have an effect on supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is what those in the industry are asking for; it is what they say will enable them to move with some certainty in the industry. It has been a long and tortuous course for them in the last 2 1/2 to three years and I think we can now say that hopefully the worst is over. They know they still have several seasons where life will be tough. But they now have certainty; there is direction within the industry and they are very pleased about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To all who have participated in the consultation, I think the industry must say thanks. There has been a very keen willingness on the part of all involved to consult and bring some sort of consensus to the final outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard people today talking about infrastructure and other aspects of government policies that might affect it. We also need to remind the states that some of the things they do have an impact upon the infrastructure and the industry. I know only too well what has happened in my own state as far as rail infrastructure goes; that has been absolutely withdrawn and decimated. There is no rail line between Burke and Nyngan; all of the wheat&mdash;and there is not much wheat&mdash;wool and cotton coming out of that area has to come by road. It is not a terribly economical way to transport those large, bulky commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also spoken recently of the huge price differential between the cost of fuel in country areas and the cost in city areas. This is being addressed by this government in the setting up of the Industry Commission inquiry. I again urge people who are concerned about fuel costs and the differentials to participate in that inquiry because it has been well recognised that that does have an effect on these commodities. There are a number of areas that need to be looked at, not just the government impost but also the problems that have been caused by others who are manipulating and playing with issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that in New South Wales the transport costs of fuel are something like 4c a litre. That does not account for the differential that is occurring in a number of these places of up to 12c or 15c. I hope that the Garnaut report will shed more light on this issue to enable us to address this problem so that the woolgrowers will have fewer overheads when getting their wool to the markets. I also urge the states not to destroy their infrastructure and their rail systems, so that life is not made more difficult for woolgrowers, all of whom have to transport their clips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I congratulate all of those who have been involved in the consultations. They have made what I think is good legislation, because agreement and consensus have been reached across the board within the industry and the political parties as well. I think that leads to good government and good legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak to this package of wool bills, I once again declare my interest in this subject, being a woolgrower, but I doubt whether anybody in this chamber is not aware of that by now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing this legislation, I want to look more at the future than the present, but in the 10 minutes available to me there are a couple of things about the present that I would like to comment on as well. Firstly, I believe it is tragic that, once again, we are back in here debating the future direction of the Australian wool industry, the greatest industry this nation has ever had. I have no doubt about the future of it. It will return, in due course, to its greatness in the Australian economy for its contribution as an export earner and also, very importantly at this time when we have such high levels of unemployment, to the pride of place it once held amongst the industries that provide direct employment and, as a flow-on, indirect employment. I have no doubt about that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a couple of points about what Senator West said, particularly with regard to price. If price did not matter, if it was not important, why did the stockpile blow out as it did when the reserve price went to 870c? The simple fact is that, through the changes that were made to the wool legislation in 1987 and the flow-on from it, we priced ourselves out of the contemporary market in a very competitive textile world market scene. Price does matter. It is vital. If the competitors&mdash;to us that means the cotton industry, the synthetic industry and others&mdash;are given a price advantage in the marketplace, purchasers of wool, and, ultimately, consumers, will shift. The price on the garment will not change because it will be made out of something else and purchasers will not be buying wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly accept Senator West's proposition that what state governments do is important, but what federal governments do is also fairly important. The decision in the government budget with regard to putting up fuel excise and sales tax will impact very dramatically on the wool industry in the component of transport. That will flow directly back to the producers and make the recovery of the industry more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking about the future, which I think is very important, I refer to the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs which was held last Friday. I want to deal with two of the committee's recommendations. The first is the one urging the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to consult fully with the industry on the further development of Wool International. As we know, the bills on Wool International are skeleton bills. They have to have the nuts and bolts and detail put into them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept the proposition, as has been stated by previous speakers tonight, that there was full and proper consultation with the industry. In the industry I include the processors and the exporters as well as the producers. I think it was Mr Lionel Ward, who gave evidence at the committee hearing last Friday on behalf of the processors, who said that if this opportunity for consultation had taken place some months ago, we would have been much better placed in terms of dealing with the problems from the processors' point of view. This was confirmed by Mr Booth, President of the Australian Council of Wool Exporters. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Woodley for that interjection. It is a fact. I think it is wrong of Senator West and others to come into this place and commend people for that consultation process when, in fact, that consultation process was very poor and very weak. I urge Senator Sherry, in his capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, to take this message back to the minister, because I think it is important in the next phase that that consultation process is improved. I say that in a genuine endeavour to make sure we get it right, not to criticise, because that is past us. The future of one hell of a lot of people is depending on what we do tonight and over the next two or three months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the welcome rises in price we have seen in this selling season, wool producers cannot go on losing $4 or $5 per head. As a wool producer, on my own figures last year, which fit with the figures from ABARE, I can tell the Senate that the losses are about $5 per sheep on the current market price. On 10,000 sheep, that means a loss of $50,000 a year. That just cannot go on and emphasises very strongly why we have to get this legislation right. The part that Wool International will play, coming out of the Garnaut report, must facilitate all the links which exist in the wool industry, because they all depend on one another&mdash;right from the lamb, when the wool is grown, to the finished garment, when it is worn in Paris or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point relates to the third recommendation in the report regarding the future of funding for wool promotion. I think it is absolutely vital and imperative&mdash;I cannot stress this enough&mdash;that the government reconsider its position on promotion. It is vitally important. When I look at the money that the government makes available in a whole host of areas in our economy, for the wool industry to be told that this is the last year in which the government will be providing funding for promotion, is a situation that cannot be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the current situation, with the growers losing money they are still putting 3.5 per cent of their gross proceeds into promotion. It is almost impossible to get a direct contribution out of the other components of the industry, such as the International Wool Textile Organisation, that will make any significant difference to the IWS, which is the International Wool Secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that is crucial to this recovery phase is the government's reconsideration of its position on promotion and its continuation of its contribution. If these bills are to be a confidence builder and provide stability, as other speakers have mentioned, it is absolutely crucial that the government shows the same sort of confidence and makes a commitment for at least another five years. I know that we did not win the last election, but the coalition made an ongoing commitment at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very strongly urge Senator Sherry to do all that he can to have this aspect of the wool industry reconsidered; as I have already said, it is imperative. At the end of the day, I came down slightly in favour of the Garnaut report after what occurred in our hearings the other day. I certainly had a leaning towards a minimum schedule with a price penalty on top of any wool sold above the schedule. But, after considering the explanations that Professor Garnaut gave us and the various aspects of all the evidence and information that we received, I think that probably the best track for us to be on is the one that we are now going down, subject to these couple of points that I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we cannot be in this place next year or the year after debating this issue again. We have made a decision, and we must stick by it. The Wool Council of Australia has said that it will stick by the decision that has been made. There have been too many statements in the wool industry, such as the one that the 700c price was immutable and would never be changed. One could go through a list of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is now before us. We are making a decision about a fixed schedule for Wool International and it must stick. We cannot accept the situation whereby 12 months or so down the track we will have another inquiry and the whole thing will be rewritten, because that will destroy the wool industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Today, the future of our great Australian wool industry is being debated in the package of wool bills that is before us.

There is absolutely no disagreement about that amongst primary industry representatives and woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One body will be the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, whose functions will be to promote research and development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us here tonight have some reservations about the totality of the Garnaut report. Neither the industry nor the opposition has a lot of choice; it is one of those things where one takes it or leaves it. We either accept the recommendations or continue to go down the path of uncertainty and instability with the wool industry using a system which has returned the worst real prices in its history. We certainly cannot continue to allow that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that I am no different to other honourable senators who have had woolgrowers approach them and say that many aspects of the Garnaut report are causing them concern; they want a trigger price or a variation of it. They have spoken to me for hours over the phone. I have told them that they do not have that luxury; they have either the Garnaut report or what they have at the moment. I do not think any of them have said to me, `Let's stick with what we have'. They all want to avoid it and get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present situation of the wool industry is desperate. There are 3.9 million bales with $2.9 billion in the stockpile. Last year, wool producers lost an average of $33,700, and 91 per cent of the growers made a loss in the industry. The dramatic fact is that on 30 June 1994, the wool industry will have to meet its debt of $600 million, with a $400 million debt repayment and $200 million in interest and storage and handling costs. That is a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we continue to go down the course that we are now going down, the wool industry will have to find $600 million. The debt can be met only by either raising taxes&mdash;the industry could not afford another half a per cent rise; it could not afford any extra tax&mdash;or dumping the $600 million worth of wool on the market. I do not know how much wool one would have to dump on the market to raise $600 million, but the more wool is dumped, the flatter the price will go. I estimate that the price would be pushed down&mdash;Senator Panizza might have an idea&mdash;to around the 350c mark, and that is totally unsustainable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Realisation Commission has played a cautious game over the last 12 months, releasing only a limited amount of wool to hold the market price at a reasonable level. But even that has not worked, with the indicator going down to a record low of 381c. The AWRC has some formula whereby it releases wool onto the market when a certain moving average is reached. The effect of that is that as soon as the price rises, wool gets released and the price is pushed back again, so there is no increase in price. As soon as the market rises, wool is released from the stockpile and the back the price goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new body, Wool International, which is to be established as soon as this legislation is passed, will manage the stockpile and debt repayment. It will place on the market 55,000 bales a month, commencing in July 1994, until June 1997 or when the debt is less than the value of the stockpile. At that time, Wool International will become a privatised company owned by the producers. There is great fear in the industry as to whether a commissioned company, such as the Wool International, will be able to do the things that Professor Garnaut wants it to do. There is doubt; still, there is hope and expectation that it will achieve what Professor Garnaut wants it to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International will be set up as a futures market, and that is of great concern to the graziers. A futures market was set up before the floor price was implemented in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. I understand from talking to the people who used that futures market that most of them got their fingers badly burnt. It was a disaster. So there is a fear in the industry that a futures market may not achieve what Professor Garnaut would really want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second attempt to set up a wool marketing scheme since the collapse of the floor price two years ago. That really sent shock waves right through the industry and they are still being felt today. At that time, Mr Kerin&mdash;and I believe this was the rock on which he perished&mdash;promised that the floor was rock solid, immutable, set in cement, and then he walked away from the industry. As I said, Mr Kerin never recovered from that position. </PARA>

That is a very short-sighted and uncaring attitude for the government to take when this industry has provided so much for Australia and can again provide so much.

I had a call today from the wool industry asking me whether we could get this legislation through tonight. We have only 10 minutes each in which to speak, and I believe I am the last speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry indicator went up by 17c yesterday, reaching 485c today. The wool price is on the up and up. If we can get it up by another 50c, it will be getting somewhere near to the cost of production. This package has given the wool industry a lift; it has given it a bit of confidence. I had been critical in this place of Professor Garnaut. I have some misgivings about certain elements of this legislation but I hope, for the wool industry's sake, that he is right and that this industry&mdash;this great Australian industry that has given us so much prosperity&mdash;returns to a healthy position.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In essence, this package of bills we are debating tonight represents a fundamental restructure of the wool industry in two particular ways. Firstly, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill deals with the functions, powers, membership and related matters of the newly established Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, which really replaces, as other speakers have said, the four statutory wool industry organisations that currently have responsibility for marketing, promotion, research, development and industry policy. I place no greater significance on this than to say that it is just a good administrative move, and that, quite frankly, is all it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of profound significance is the second bill, the Wool International Bill 1993. As has been widely publicised, this bill replaces the Wool Realisation Commission that manages the wool stockpile and the debt. The explanatory notes to this bill tell us that Wool International will market the stockpile and foster the development of risk management and marketing mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool International has been initially structured as a statutory authority, but along commercial lines to reflect its ultimate transformation to a privatised public company. That process will be triggered at a time when Wool International has a strong, positive net worth, a manageable debt profile and a sound capital base. The target date for privatisation is mid-1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Behind this legislation is an industry in crisis, in very grave danger of never coming out of that crisis until this legislation before the parliament and the recommendations of the Garnaut report work&mdash;a simple word, but it is most necessary that it work. There is nothing tangible in the Garnaut report and in this legislation to assure the industry&mdash;in particular, the farmers&mdash;that there will be an immediate solution to the crisis, particularly as the Garnaut report does not take effect until July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is diverse opinion over the disposal of this massive stockpile of 3.9 million bales. The Garnaut solution, under the management of the new body, Wool International, is to release the bales according to a fixed disposal schedule. Garnaut argues convincingly that the rigid schedule will stop the speculation over amounts to be released from the stockpile, which has been affecting the price on the auction floor and, further, that the fixed schedule will assure a certain reduction in the stockpile over time. These are very vital market signals. It is believed that this course will smooth out the boom and bust cycle that has plagued the industry over the past years. It does so at a rate of 27,000 to 29,000 bales a month from July through to December next year and a release from January 1995 of some 132 million kilograms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut committee believes that it will not be difficult to sell this amount of wool as last year sales amounted to 820 million kilograms. With this demand and production predicted to be only 690 million kilograms in the next year or two, it will leave about a 130 million-kilogram gap to be filled by the release of the stockpile. The movement away from the Wool Realisation Committee and its flexible release of the stockpile was due to the fact this system allowed for wool to be dumped on to a rising market, depressing wool prices simply to meet an arbitrary debt repayment scheme. This gave all the wrong signals to the buyer and seller. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report is not without its critics. Its critics say that this method of selling the stockpile is also giving all the wrong signals to the market. They believe that the stockpile should be sold as it is now when the demand makes it a reasonable thing to do. I tend to agree with the critics when they say that this is treating the stockpile more as an asset than does the fixed schedule. The critics go on to say that the best policy would be to establish a base price under which wool would not be sold from the stockpile. It would provide more certainty to the industry than the present decision and would enable the stockpile to be managed as an asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my opinion that the Garnaut solution to the massive wool stockpile will work provided one important variable holds up&mdash;that is, the current demand of 820 million kilograms per year. While prices are low due to the stockpile, this is a very significant demand. There are probably only one or two</PARA>
<PARA>patches in the history of wool sales that have matched this volume of exports that we are currently experiencing. Should this variable fail, Garnaut fails, and we will be back in this parliament rewriting the legislation again. The point is that we cannot afford such an error. We cannot afford to be wrong again. Australia's greatest industry is at stake. It is definitely now dying. We have no second chance any more. Farmers' net profits are as follows: in 1991-92 they were minus $40,810; in 1992-93 they were minus $34,400; and it is forecast for 1993-94 that it will be minus $39,000. Even those farmers with a mixture of sheep and beef are forecast to lose at much as $27,500 and those with a mixture of sheep and cereal are forecast to lose $9,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confidence in the rural sector does not match the confidence being displayed in the business sector. A recent farm survey undertaken by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy stated that 35 per cent of farmers interviewed believed that they would be forced to leave the industry or they had serious doubts about their ability to survive. We should keep in mind this 35 per cent possible exodus because this is over and above those already forced or evicted from the land. It is a misconception to believe that the farmers enjoyed the 1980s boom period that those entrepreneurs, marketeers and agents and the mining sector enjoyed. Those prices never reached the farm gate because they were faced with high interest rates, agent fees and all sorts of overheads and costs. Those boom years never reached the farmer and his family. Today's prices are the lowest since the Great Depression. Australia has travelled three generations to reach a point where the Australian wool farmer is worse off than in the Great Depression. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. For the 53,000 farmers involved in wool production in this country, living very poorly and under the constant financial pressure which these conditions inevitably bring, a great deal hinges upon their public representatives tonight to get this legislation right and to help them in so many other ways. I am not just talking about the 53,000 farmers but the 53,000 families and the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the small towns to service those farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this government that has had the most serious destabilising effect upon this industry and it has contributed to the depression within the wool industry. We have used the word `recession' quite frequently to sum up the whole economy but within this micro-economy it is a depression. That chart I tabled will prove that. This is the fifth restructure of the industry that has been undertaken by this government. It is an industry in which Australia dominates. We have some 80 per cent of the apparel wool market. What South Africa is to diamonds, Australia is to wool. We have just wrecked that industry. Yet we have seen the greatest price collapse of this industry since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History may show that the legacy of the Labor Party in government was the highest unemployment rate and the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In fact, we have had the worst Prime Minister since Billy Hughes in the 1930s. But the blackest spot in the history of this government and its worst legacy will be the dismantling of the Australian wool industry. This is the industry on which Australia, quite frankly, built its character. It has a worldwide reputation. It produces billions of dollars of export income. It has created an infrastructure for rural communities and towns, it has formed the foundation of postwar increases in the standard of living and it has even stimulated art, poetry and legendary characters. Yet it is being driven out of existence. It has consistently ranked as the first or second of our top exports; it has now been driven down to sixth and is still falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues have mentioned the government's lack of funding for promotion. I find this extremely unusual. It is fair to say that the government has completely and utterly walked away from this industry. Yet the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Alan Griffiths, has announced a review of government industry policy in which he claims he seeks `an activist policy' which is light-handed. He means that certain industries will be selected and sought out for concessions and support that will stimulate them. It seems to me that the wool industry, our finest industry, will be left out of this new found policy of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Boswell said, this incompetence goes back to 1990 when John Kerin was minister for primary industry and oversaw the destruction of the wool floor price, bringing the greatest instability to this industry, the effects of which we are still experiencing today. John Kerin may have failed as Treasurer of this country but his biggest failure was as primary industry minister, if only because he had more time to wreak havoc. The floor price scheme that had worked so well in this country for decades deserved far greater support than was given by this government. Before he leaves parliament, John Kerin has to face the truth that he played a great part in wrecking this fine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably little more faith in the competence of Mr Simon Crean, the current Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. But I will say that we all join him in crossing our fingers today as this legislation goes through the parliament in the hope against hope that we have the remedy to restore the livelihoods of those involved in this great industry and, in particular, the farmers of this industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank members of the government and particularly members of the opposition for their generally positive responses in this debate. I have to say that the first line of the last contribution was a pledge of support for this legislation but the arguments in support of that pledge of support rapidly fell away as the contribution from Senator McGauran progressed. I am going to deal with a couple of the points he made shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to acknowledge the contribution made by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs in its examination of this legislation. I will be drawing on a couple of the comments in its report a little later in my concluding remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Parliamentary Secretary handling this matter, I have to acknowledge the very wide support for the government's approach in dealing with this legislation which arises from the recommendations presented to the government in the Garnaut report. I will stress one issue that is very important. The government realised that it had to move quickly to implement the recommendations of Professor Garnaut, and that is why the legislation is before the Senate this evening. Generally, the market reaction to the government's initiatives and legislation has been positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable senators from the National Party might find these figures quite interesting. Since the government announced its support for the package on 8 September, the wool price has improved. Prior to 8 September the wool price had been on a progressive decline. In the week ending 29 July this year the wool price was 449c a kilogram clean. It then went down to 438c, 432c, 430c, 413c and then 412c per kilogram clean. Then, bingo, on 8 September the government announced that it would implement the Garnaut package and from then we have seen a progressive increase in the price of wool. In the week ending 10 September the price for wool was 423c per kilogram clean. The following week it was 430c, 433c, 434c, 444c, 451c and then 461c per kilogram clean. I understand that as of 7 o'clock this evening the price had reached 492c per kilogram clean. That is a very significant increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not be fair to directly attribute the whole of that price rise to the government's announcement, but it certainly had some impact because it provided a positive undertaking to the market about the direction the government intended to take. That has had an effect on the price of wool. The price rise in wool over the last three months has been approximately 20 per cent. I acknowledge the positive impact that the wool industry and the opposition, to its credit, have played in adopting a generally bipartisan approach to the package when it was announced on 8 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report is all about getting the market signals right and removing government intervention from that market. That is really the basic philosophical principle underpinning the legislation that we are considering this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will traverse back to 1990 briefly later. This legislation provides a clear market signal which will impact&mdash;and it is already having an impact&mdash;on all aspects of the wool industry right through to farmland, environmental management and integrated land care issues that were raised earlier today by Senator Margetts. I will make a few comments about her contribution later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate that the government will not be accepting the two amendments moved by Senator Woodley. I apologise to Senator Woodley that I was not here during his contribution early on in the debate. However, I have sat through most of the debate over the last couple of hours. I was regrettably detained listening to some particular problems that the apple and pear industries have and could not be here for Senator Woodley's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically the approach Senator Woodley is advocating in his amendments is that he wants a more interventionist approach to be taken to the wool market. That is the philosophy underlying his approach. He is seeking to have this legislation send signals to growers to secure production, but at the same time he is proposing a price band approach to the fixed schedule which will mask the signals that the market should be giving to the growers in any free market that is responding to legitimate supply and demand pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment that he is proposing is a price band. The government and opposition are supporting a very specific fixed schedule. That amendment has the effect of a fixed disposal schedule operating within a band of 400c to 800c per kilogram. That would be used to smooth out the so-called price extremes in the sale of the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This price band approach would run directly counter to the basic intention of this legislation and to the policy recommendations of Professor Garnaut. It does that in two ways. Firstly, the introduction of price bands would be a direct contradiction to the Garnaut report's intention to stimulate, as far as possible, real market conditions. That is quite critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price band would retain the scope for a government agency to exercise a market smoothing policy. I commend Senator Panizza for strongly supporting this fixed schedule rather than supporting some variant in the pricing band as is being proposed by the Australian Democrats. In a strong market a ceiling approach could dampen potential market demand for forward purchases and create speculation as the ceiling is approached. We believe that is highly undesirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason for opposing the first amendment is that the market culture and the change to wool ownership transfer and risk management would be significantly impeded by a price banding policy because it implies a floor price and a price ceiling mentality. When the stockpile has been eliminated the industry will have to live with market supply and demand shifts without price smoothing policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price bands proposed by the Democrats have the potential to master market signals to buyers and sellers. The key point in opposing the proposal by the Australian Democrats is that the fixed schedule proposed by the Garnaut committee is central to the development of a market and a risk management mechanism which may otherwise be hindered by a price band approach. That is a quite critical issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter was canvassed by the Senate committee. On page 14 of the report, Professor Garnaut said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know there is a view that it is a bit of a waste to have a strong demand for wool reflected in a higher price for a while. I do not think it is, because I think that the balance sheets of our farming community are so weak that cash in there is cash in a good place.</PARA>
<PARA>What Professor Garnaut was pointing out was that we have a fixed schedule and as supply decreases demand should increase&mdash;and that is already happening&mdash;but if we have a price banding mechanism then presumably there would be more wool released from the stockpile and that would deflate the price that the market is paying for that wool. That would take away from growers some of that price&mdash;it may not be the price that they would like&mdash;improvement resulting from an increasing demand for wool. We strongly oppose the first amendment moved by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment proposes to cover Wool International's so-called trading losses. None of the wool tax for debt management will be used for risky wool international commercial activities, as was alleged by Senator Woodley in his speech today. The debt management will simply not be used for that purpose. There is certainly some flexibility within the legislation for some overselling and underselling of the schedule, but it is very minor. Only particular contracts that may require that will be taken into account. It certainly is not going to occur in any significant way. That will be very closely scrutinised by the industry, by the minister and certainly by Wool International. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made specific arrangements for funding commercial activities by agreeing to allow the revenue stream from non-wool assets managed by Wool International to be used to develop new risk management tools such as futures. So there is provision for those non-wool assets. I would assume that the non-wool assets would include primarily property, warehouses and the like that Wool International may choose to sell. In any case, the risk management mechanisms are designed to reduce risk&mdash;not increase risk. I think that is quite a critical factor in the farm business. So it is not inherently risky, as has been suggested by Senator Woodley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool debt is clearly regarded by the Commonwealth as an industry debt for which the industry is ultimately responsible. At the time of privatisation, the government has confirmed its commitment, through its legislation, to issue shares in Wool International to wool taxpayers. I think that is a commendable approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government already covers by guarantee the entire debt associated with the wool stockpile, which currently amounts to $2.2 billion. So it is not appropriate to provide an additional guarantee over and above the existing guarantee, as is proposed in the amendment moved by Senator Woodley. Once privatised, Wool International will operate as a full commercial company under the corporations law. The sooner the body accommodates activities in the commercial environment, the stronger it will be at the time of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I commenced my speech, I referred to some comments by Senator McGauran. I want to say very briefly that there can be no absolute guarantee for the future of the wool industry. But this legislation provides much greater certainty for the markets in their assessment of the future supply of wool and, therefore, the likely demand and price for wool producers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran tabled a document which says that today's wool price is at a record low and is equivalent to prices during the depression. That is simply not correct. This was certainly true up until six months ago and it was certainly true in the last two years. But the price in the last three months is not far from the average price that was being received from 1975 through until 1987. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone could have foreseen the collapse in demand, which was brought about&mdash;this was not the only factor, but it was certainly an important factor&mdash;by the collapse of the communist regime in the Soviet Union. One of the ironies of the position we are in today is that the collapse of the former centralist and planned economy of the Soviet Union has led to the end of centralised buying of wool in that country, and I think it will be a long time before it recovers. So in making a criticism of Mr Kerin, let us at least be a little balanced in acknowledging that there were other factors. From my conversations with Mr Kerin, I think he does acknowledge that he made some errors during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank various members of the opposition. I have already thanked Senator Panizza for his contribution. He picked up a very vital point that was made in the Senate report. I think the point was made by none other than one of the critics of these proposals, Dr Lionel Ward, who speculated that we could have a shortage of wool. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You could have a situation in which prices, internationally, for Australian wool, not only rise to the level desired and sought by Australian woolgrowers, but rise to a level which makes wool uncompetitive and causes a substitution out of wool before we have had any decent recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>I found that a rather fascinating criticism of these proposals. Senator Panizza quite rightly picked up that point. The honourable senator made the very vital point that if we cannot supply the market we will be in a good position because the price will be very much higher. I see Senator Panizza nodding; he is spot on. I do not think that can be a legitimate criticism of this legislation, as was outlined by Dr Ward before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza drew attention to the costs involved in the production of wool. I again pay him credit for pointing out that, whilst he was concerned about shearing costs, he did not necessarily see that that could be addressed by reducing the pay rates of shearers, whom he acknowledged are amongst the hardest workers in our Australian community. I certainly endorse those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sandy Macdonald referred to the work of the opposition in looking at the legislation. As I have said, I commend and thank the opposition for its support. I think Senator Macdonald made some grossly unfair criticism of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean. I thought it was very unfair to condemn him for being absent without leave. I have been with Minister Crean on a number of occasions over the past couple of months when he has held consultations with the wool industry. Within the confines of the minister's very busy schedule&mdash;the minister deals with energy issues and other primary industry, resource and forestry matters; it is a very heavy set of commitments&mdash;the government consulted as widely as it could, having regard to the necessary time frame which required a reasonably quick response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's consultative process commenced within half an hour of the public release of the Garnaut committee's report, and it continued. The process took place over a 2 1/2 month period and involved the minister, members of the minister's office and officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Meetings were held with representatives of all the wool industry sectors, including producers, traders, processors and manufacturers. Meeting were held with both domestic and overseas representatives of the processing and manufacturing sectors. The Wool Council of Australia also carried out its own consultative process. So I cannot accept Senator Macdonald's criticism of my minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) was saying, I believe that my amendments not only take account of the Garnaut report but also give to Garnaut a further modification or way of improving his proposal for a fixed release schedule. We are not wanting to do away with a fixed release schedule, but we want to make a moderate amendment to that schedule so that there would be price indicators to the market. These indicators would establish an acceptable range within which the market ought to operate. I accept what Dr Ward said in his submission that, if the market overheats to too large a degree, there will be a transfer of buyers, processors and consumers away from wool to other fibres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposal to have a market indicator of 800c provides a means of dampening down an overheated market and enables it to continue within a range that is both acceptable to growers and to the market itself. The bottom price, a market indicator of 400c, sends the right signal to everybody that Australia is not prepared to treat this asset as a commodity to be sold in some kind of fire sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment clarifies the role of government until Wool International becomes privatised. Obviously after that, it will operate fully as a grower owned and controlled instrumentality. But until that time, it is the responsibility of government to assure woolgrowers that any losses incurred by Wool International while it is still a government instrumentality will be covered by government. Those are the reasons why I press these amendments. I trust that the chamber will support them and see the sensible modification that they make to Professor Garnaut's proposals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addressing the issues that have been raised today specifically by the Australian Democrats in the form of these amendments, it is necessary to take the committee back over some of the discussion that has happened throughout the day, the hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs last Friday and what has been argued throughout the industry over the last few months. The Australian Democrats, through Senator Woodley, have chosen to present&mdash;both in his speech on the second reading and in his comments to the committee&mdash;what I think the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) described as an interventionist stance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley is reflecting sectional interests and responding to the arguments of a minority view on this particular issue. To a certain extent I think the proposals he put forward attempt to second-guess the Garnaut report in some respects. It was interesting to note that, in this very comprehensive and wide ranging debate which has engaged the Senate for most of today, there were 15 speakers other than the minister in reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very interesting to note and appreciate the views that Senator Woodley put forward on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I respect those views, the stance that he took today and his participation in last Friday's special committee meeting. Of course, senator Woodley was very honest in that he handed down a dissenting view to the committee's report and, therefore, we did know his stance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts made reference to the stance taken and a number of issues raised by the Greens. There were 11 speakers from the coalition parties. It is significant, in view of the importance of this issue, that those speakers should range over a number of issues and reflect the diversity of views across the electorate and the industry. We have been able to come to a decision which I do not think Senator Woodley will like because we are not going to support his amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment I would make is to express my disappointment that, in this comprehensive and far-reaching debate today, Senator Sue West was the only Labor senator other than the parliamentary secretary to speak on these bills. It concerns me that the Australian Labor Party has not participated more in this debate to express its various views and opinions. I appreciate that Senator West did take an interest in last Friday's committee. She was a bit hasty at the end of the day when she attempted to pre-empt the committee while we were trying to reach a conclusion. Nevertheless, Senator West did participate and she came in here today and reiterated those views. But not one other member of the Australian Labor Party was prepared to come in here and speak in representation of this important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn to the points that have been raised by Senator Woodley in his amendments. The whole concept of the Garnaut plan is to operate the industry as if there were, in fact, no stockpile. As long as people think they can buy from the stockpile if they run short or, in this case, if the price goes to 800c, the incentive to buy forward is reduced. People will only buy forward if they think the price may go up or that there will be a shortage. If we set the price between 400c and 800c and ensure there will be never be a shortage, what incentive is there for forward buying?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would undo the very fabric of the plan. It would ensure that the stockpile still hung over the market and would doom growers to continuing low prices. We know that Wool International will try to sell its fixed amount ahead of time. This will ensure that there is a shortage of wool in the auction system and this will cause the price to rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Garnaut told the Senate committee last week that no-one was really thinking that the price of wool next year would be the price that it was in 1987. He said that anyone who thought that this was a substantial possibility would be buying and stocking wool in order to make a fortune and that would be lifting the current price right now. Professor Garnaut said there was a bit of that going on, which is one of the reasons the market is currently strengthening. But if it was a dominant view, the market would be behaving differently from the way that it actually is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to think about the future. We need growers to know the true market value of wool long before the stockpile is gone so that they can gear production up or down. It would be silly to put selling the stockpile above keeping woolgrowers on their farms. If we keep the prices depressed, growers will go out of farming and then, when the stockpile is sold, there will be a critical shortage of wool and the price will go high and we will not have any more wool to dampen the price. Therefore, it seems sensible that we have the price rise now, rather than some years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the second issue raised by Senator Woodley, that of the government guarantee, the government is already guaranteeing the money owed on the stockpile and should not be forced to also guarantee private negotiations. The Australian Democrat amendment would give an unfair advantage over private companies. For those reasons the coalition will not be supporting the Australian Democrats' amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not hold the Senate very long. I must clear up any misapprehension that I may have caused when I queried the fixed schedule reduction scheme. I stated quite clearly in my speech on the second reading that I believe that whatever we sell on the fixed reduction scheme, we stick to it. Who is to say whether Professor Garnaut and the government, in formulating this legislation, have hit on exactly the right sort of schedule? But I am prepared to accept the schedule that is contained in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction scheme should remain fixed because, as I said this morning, if we leave a back door open, something will happen. If the door is there, if an escape route is there, someone will find an excuse to use it. We have had five schemes in the past where that escape door has been left open and something has happened. Let us not do it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to look briefly at the situation that Senator Woodley told us about. He is more or less advocating that the higher the price the more we can let on to the market, and the lower the price the less we can let on to the market. I am afraid that that is not going to work, for reasons that Senator Tambling and others have already canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been quickly trying to show in equation form how the scheme would work. I used a comparison with the pressure-volume equation in hydraulics where the higher the pressure through the aperture the greater the volume delivered, and as the pressure comes down the volume delivered is less. Senator Woodley left world demand out of the equation. That will interfere with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other element of that equation is temperature. I relate temperature to world demand. If we do not take into account all those other considerations, including world demand, it will not work. It is a good attempt to please everyone&mdash;the buyers, the sellers and the brokers in the middle&mdash;but it will not work. Let us back the Garnaut system and have a fixed schedule and stick to it. Otherwise, as Senator West said, we will be back here next year debating some more. </PARA>

Secondly, this is government policy. It speaks for itself. It is our policy that we are implementing, and I commend those opposite for congratulating it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Panizza and Senator Tambling for their support, particularly Senator Panizza who I commended in the second reading debate. He is spot on. If we are to have a moving band of sale of the wool stockpile, when the price goes up presumably we will sell more from the stockpile and the price will drop. We do not want that to happen at the moment because whatever gains we can make in price increase should go to the grower, and that is what the growers require at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is, of course, that people out in the market would speculate. They would see that the wool stockpile could be released outside a fixed schedule and they would then wait till the price reached a certain level and speculate against the wool stockpile. The basic intention of this legislation is to let the market signals dictate the price, particularly the international market, not to let legislative signals dictate the market. That is the wrong approach. We have tried that once already with fairly calamitous results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that Senator Woodley referred to is the notion of a further underwriting of industry debt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 derives from the  Treasurer's Banking Policy Statement of 18 June 1993, and relates to the Government's decision to liberalise foreign bank entry, announced by the Prime Minister in the One Nation Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Banking Act 1959 has already been amended by the Banking Legislation Amendment Act 1992, which received the Royal Assent on 21 December 1992, to give effect to the Government's decision in One Nation to liberalise foreign bank entry. Those amendments enable foreign banks, whether they have been operating in Australia or not, to apply for a banking authority under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959; and permit foreign banks, which are authorised under the Banking Act, to operate as banks in the form of a branch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the current bill is to facilitate the transfer of certain assets and liabilities from foreign bank subsidiaries in Australia to new branches. These subsidiaries will have been in existence prior to 18 June 1993 and may be either authorised banks under section 9 of the Banking Act 1959, or money market corporations registered under the Financial Corporations Act 1974 (or any subsidiaries of those bodies which are registered under the Financial Corporations Act 1974). In a limited number of cases the transfer may be between a pre-existing subsidiary and a new authorised bank subsidiary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be eligible to transfer assets and liabilities under the proposed legislation, foreign banks will have, from the commencement of the legislation, three years within which to apply for a banking authority, and up to six years to effect the transfer. The proposed legislation will minimise administrative procedures, and waive the payment of both Commonwealth and State transfer fees and charges. Without these changes foreign banks would be inhibited from responding to the Government's policy decision to encourage increased effective competition and efficiency in the Australian financial sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Bill 1993 will facilitate the establishment of branch operations in Australia by ensuring that foreign banks currently operating an authorised bank subsidiary or money market corporation are not disadvantaged compared to new foreign bank entrants when establishing branch banking operations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of changes to the income tax law to ensure that the tax consequences that would normally arise on the transfer of business from foreign bank subsidiaries to branches are deferred, and that double taxation and double deductions do not arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To do this, the bill places the branch in the same position as the subsidiary would have been had its assets and liabilities not been transferred. This treatment will extend to all assets and liabilities transferred under this legislation, including debts owing to the subsidiary that are transferred to the branch and are subsequently  written off as bad. Also, any interest paid on borrowings transferred to the branch, which would have been exempt from interest withholding tax under section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 if paid by the subsidiary, will be exempt under the same provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further assist the smooth transition from subsidiary to branch banking, the subsidiaries of foreign banks will be able to transfer existing tax losses to branches of the banks. In this way, the ability to claim deductions for past tax losses will not be disturbed by the transition to branch banking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that these changes will bring competitive gains and efficiencies to the banking sector;  greater flexibility in the provision of finance;  and cost advantages to Australian clients. The measures contained in the bill should also further improve the international competitiveness of the Australian financial system.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to implement the EC/Australia Wine Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 6 December 1992, I jointly announced with our wine industry that Australian and European Commission officials had negotiated the text of a bilateral wine agreement aimed at improving our bilateral wine trade. This announcement attracted wide media attention, rightly so, as the European Community is Australia's largest export market for wine. During 1992/93, Australian winemakers exported 44m litres worth $144m to the EC, or almost half of our total exports of $293m. This Agreement will guarantee our continued access to the EC market which will remain the key market as our wine industry strives to lift exports to $1 billion by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation enables the Agreement to enter into force and our winemakers to enjoy its benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement provides for the mutual recognition of each Party's winemaking practices and standards; it affords mutual protection to each Party's geographical indications, that is, the names of our wine regions such as Coonawarra and Hunter Valley; it reduces the number of analyses the EC requires of Australian wines from 8 to 3; it allows Australian winemakers to market wines in the EC labelled with multi-varietal and multi-regional blends; and it allows the export of Australian sweet wines such as the justly famous De Bortoli "Noble One" to the European Community&mdash;previously not permitted. Importantly, it prevents either party from introducing additional certification requirements on imports of each other's wines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement recognises the importance of European geographical indications to the European Community. It also recognises the widespread use of EC names on Australian wines. The Agreement provides for the gradual phase-out of our use of EC geographical indications according to their commercial importance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are four tranches of EC names to be protected. A list of thousands of EC geographical names which are of no commercial significance to us will be protected immediately the Agreement enters into force. The second tranche is of little used names such as `Frascati' and `White Bordeaux'; these will be phased-out on the 31 December this year. A further group of names of some importance to us such as `Chianti` and `Madeira' must be phased-out by 31 December 1997. The last tranche includes names which are widely used by our winemakers, names like `Claret', `Chablis', `Burgundy' and `Champagne'. Phase-out periods for these names have yet to be determined but the Agreement provides that negotiations on phase-out dates for these names must be concluded by 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have used European geographical names to denote a style of wine for more than a hundred years. Migrants often brought these names to Australia and used them to describe a familiar style of wine; the names have become generic. Names like `champagne` have been used to describe a dry sparkling wine. Once protection commences, both European and Australian geographical indications will only be used to indicate the true place of origin of the wine. Thus the name `champagne' will only be used to describe wine made in the `Champagne' region of France.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement provides for additional phase-out periods to clear stock from wholesalers and retailers. Australian wine made prior to the phase-out period for production labelled with the protected EC names may be marketed by wholesalers for up to three years and by retailers until stocks are exhausted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian winemakers have already begun using varietal and brand names to replace European geographical indications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for the protection of traditional wine expressions. Words such as "brut" or "reserve" are frequently used to indicate a certain quality or style of wine. Under the bill, traditional expressions may only be used to describe wine which originates in the country in which the expression has been traditionally and consistently used. The lists of both Australian and EC traditional expressions are still under negotiation by the two parties to the Agreement. The bill provides for protection to commence when the traditional expressions are entered  in a register. This will occur after negotiations on protection of traditional names are concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement has the strong support of the peak wine industry body, the Winemakers' Federation of Australia. Wine industry representatives were fully involved in the negotiations on the Agreement from the outset. The Agreement has strong support throughout the European Community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes a Geographical Indications Committee to determine the boundaries of Australian geographical indications. EC regulations require that where wine exported to the EC is labelled with a geographical indication, the boundaries of that region must be defined precisely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where does Coonawarra end and Riverland start? This question is just as relevant for Australian wine consumers. By defining the boundaries of our geographical indications, this bill will give greater certainty to enforcement of the Label Integrity Program provisions of the Act, which require winemakers to keep records to substantiate label claims of the vintage, variety or geographical indication of wine. The bill will give consumers the guarantee that when wine is labelled "Coonawarra", the grapes from which the wine was made came from within the defined boundaries of the Coonawarra region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Geographical Indications Committee will comprise a Winemakers' Federation of Australia nominee, a nominee of the Wine Grape Growers' Council of Australia and an Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation (AWBC) nominee. The Committee will publish proposed determinations and seek submissions from winemakers and grapegrowers and their organisations on the boundaries of Australian wine regions. There will be appeal rights to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes a Registrar of geographical indications and traditional expressions who will be an employee of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. The Registrar will list all geographical indications determined by the Committee, list the protected EC names and inform other countries of Australia's protected names.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Winemakers' Federation of Australia has applied to the National Food Authority to have the Australian Food Standards Code covering wine modernised and brought more closely into line with EC standards. The NFA application, even if accepted in its entirety, will not authorise all EC winemaking practices. There are some EC standards which the Australian wine industry does not want to adopt for wine made in Australia. The bill authorises the import of wine from the EC which conforms with the compositional requirements set down in the Agreement and allows these standards to be varied from time to time by agreement as EC winemaking practises change. The EC practices differ in minor ways and in ways which do not affect health, from the standards set by the National Food Authority for sale of Australian and imported wine. EC wine will still have to comply in all other respects with Australian standards, for example with regard to labelling with alcoholic content.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EC/Australia Wine Agreement is the first of several agreements on wine we intend to conclude with our major wine trading partners. Work is already underway on developing a wine agreement with New Zealand. The bill therefore amends the objects of the Act to include implementing the EC/Australia Wine Agreement; enabling Australia to implement further international agreements relating to trade in wine; and defining Australian geographical indications for wine. It extends the powers and functions of the AWBC to cover administration of the EC/Australia Wine Agreement and the definition of Australian geographical indications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill creates several new offences. The offences include the false or misleading use of geographical indications and traditional expressions for wine. However, winemakers will continue to be able to use their individual name and the individual name of their predecessor in business, in the course of trade, even where that name is the same as the name of a protected geographical indication.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the Act to allow regulations to be made concerning blending rules for wine and the composition of export wine. These Regulations will not be activated until there has been further consultations with the wine industry, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation and the National Food Authority. The bill also allows the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to prescribe the grape varieties which may be used in making wine. This will prevent the use of hybrid grape varieties in export wine, which is a concern in some export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will have no financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill and the Agreement it seeks to implement, presents challenges for our wine industry including the opportunity to consolidate our position in the world market. It represents a landmark commitment by our industry and a true sign that our industry has come of age internationally. It removes technical trade barriers to our wines on EC markets. More importantly, it provides the important basis for continued future access to this market!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In handling the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 for the opposition, I indicate at the outset that the Liberal and National parties will support its passage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what we do not support is a broader issue pertinent to Australia's trade and indirectly to the aims of this bill&mdash;that is, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), strutting around the world stage at the Cyprus Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, when he was merely a stone's throw from the Arab world which is a significant export market for Australia that could be further developed. Australia's exports to the Arab nations are currently around the $3 billion mark, and to Israel we export a further $ 1/4 billion worth of goods. But has the Prime Minister, while in that region, bothered to visit any of these, our major customers, in that area? No, he certainly has not. Indeed, there has not been a ministerial visit to the Middle East since the March election. Even Senator Cook, the Minister for Trade, has ignored this very important region. I will say a little more about this matter later in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendments proposed in this bill relate to three distinct areas. Firstly, the treatment for the purpose of export market development grant eligibility of expenditure incurred by corporations and individuals under insolvency administration; secondly, the exclusion from grant eligibility of persons with certain convictions; and, thirdly, the lodgement of grant claims on a half-yearly basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to tighten up the net through which canny and cunning operators will seek to continue rorting the availability of taxpayer funded grants, and such a move is long overdue. Currently, under the act and under the scheme, those unscrupulous individuals with criminal convictions are able to obtain grants, and this is simply not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to ensure that claimants who make export development expenditure while under a scheme of arrangement are eligible for assistance only if the business is certified to be a going concern at the time of that expenditure. This means that the business operations of the claimants must be sound and intact before any further dipping into taxpayer funded grants is permitted, and this, of course, is how the scheme should operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also introduces a combination of technical and administrative amendments which seek to protect the scheme's principles and efficiency. It provides for half-yearly grant payments in respect of exporters' early stages of marketing. That will be of great assistance to newly developing exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With particular reference to the bill, sections 11UA and 11UB relate to insolvency. Section 11UA relates to the government's decision in respect of bodies corporate that expenditure incurred while a claimant was under insolvency administration is not claimable unless the claimant is certified to be solvent at the time the expenditure was incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 11UB seeks to make expenditure which could otherwise be reimbursed by Austrade incapable of being reimbursed where it is incurred by a person who is under insolvency administration or by a partnership or corporation when a member of the partnership or a director of the corporation is under insolvency administration. Additionally, expenditure by a partnership will not be reimbursed when one of the members of the partnership is a corporation and a director of the corporate partner is under insolvency administration. However, a new owner of a previously insolvent export business&mdash;that is, someone who takes over the ownership or management of a business earlier made insolvent&mdash;may still make a claim for reimbursement under section 19 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to criminal convictions, new section 11YA will exclude from eligibility, for up to five years from release of custody, claimants with criminal convictions for breaches of key corporate duties or offences which involve fraud or dishonesty and which carry two years imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sound principle being proposed here in section 13 relates to the requirement for companies to demonstrate an appropriate level of performance before further claims are granted. This is also a timely amendment because it will ensure that companies are making real attempts to emerge as significant export concerns and not simply relying on government grant funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These steps will certainly help those Australian exporters who are making ground in the fragile export arena. But it is an indictment on this government that the Prime Minister ignored opportunities to arrange a bilateral visit to one or two Middle Eastern countries to improve our trade and export relationship when he was already visiting a nearby country&mdash;that is, Cyprus&mdash;for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It is alarming because the Arab countries of the Middle East and Israel are major customers for our rural products. Given the parlous state that our primary producers currently find themselves in, this is simply not good enough from the leader of this country. In particular, these countries are targets for United States export enhancement program subsidies and subsidised product from the European Community on the very products which we sell to them. So our markets there are under severe threat. The Prime Minister should have ensured that he visited at least one or two of these countries en route to or from Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from our exports of grain to the region, the following figures indicate the importance of these markets for our products. The United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait purchased $207.3 million worth of live animals in 1991-92. In the same year Saudi Arabia alone purchased a total of $206.7 million in major exports from Australia, including $80 million worth of sheep and goat meat and $91.9 million worth of cheese and curd. Yet the Prime Minister did not visit Saudi Arabia on his way to or from Cyprus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is visiting Indonesia en route home. This is worth while because Indonesia is also a significant market for Australia of some $438 million worth of cotton, minerals and wheat. But that is no excuse for the Prime Minister's overt neglect of the middle-eastern countries and their potential to us as export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Prime Minister continues to push the value and importance of our Asian neighbours as export markets and seeks to persuade Australians that they are part of Asia, I remind him that more than 15 years ago, in an address-in-reply debate in the other place, I called for Australia to `turn our face to Asia' as a market for our goods. In the light of the Prime Minister's recent interest in Asia, I do not recall him demonstrating at that time such prescience or any particular interest in Asia as a source of trade for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of the facts shows a pathetic but dramatic contrast between the reality and the rhetoric as far as our trade with Asia under the present government is concerned. Under 10 years of Hawke and Keating Labor governments, although the global amount of trade in Asia has grown quite significantly, Australia's share of that trade has fallen quite dramatically. This really is a hopeless performance under this Labor government. Our poor performance must be sheeted home to this government's failure to maintain the pace of reform required to allow Australian producers of goods and services to be sufficiently competitive in that market against other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude these remarks by reiterating the opposition's support for this legislation but saying to the government that it is absolutely critical that it quicken the pace of industrial relations reform and taxation reform&mdash;getting taxes, particularly input taxes, off the back of business&mdash;and continue to reform our waterfront, where the level and pace of reform is still inadequate, and all of those other areas which we on this side of the chamber have been advocating now for some years to ensure that producers of goods and services in Australia are competitive with those of other countries which are taking advantage of the dramatic growth in Asia. Otherwise we will continue to be left behind. While in absolute terms the dollar value of our exports to those Asian countries might increase, our share of that trade will continue to fall as it has under a decade of Labor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I advert to the details of the Export Market Development Grants Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, I express the hope that the new activist direction sketched out by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Alan Griffiths) in the area of industry development will also be adopted for the area of trade, and that this legislation, which seeks to encourage Australian industries to increase exports and to unlock new markets, will be reviewed from that point of view; namely, a more activist stance and a more interventionist stance, with more direct and active support for Australian industries which wish to push into international export markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eligibility for the grants included in the bill is determined by the amount of eligible expenditure which a business has incurred in a grant year. One of the major aims of this bill is to limit eligibility for grants to companies, partnerships or individuals who are under insolvency administration by defining their expenditure as non-claimable. This would appear to be a response by the government to the Gregory Symons-Marshall Islands affair. The Australian Democrats welcome this move by the government to protect the scheme's integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also seeks to exclude from eligibility claimants with certain convictions. Proposed section 11YA will make expenditure incurred by a person convicted of certain offences involving fraud and dishonesty which are punishable by at least two years imprisonment non-claimable for a period of five years after conviction or release from custody. This ineligibility applies to companies and partnerships which have either a director or partner who was convicted of the specified offences. Once again, the Australian Democrats support these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This section is not sufficient to exclude those individuals or companies with eligible claims prior to the conviction. Hence, section 14A proposes to make grants unpayable on claims received from convicted persons where the claim period entitlement is wholly or partly before the conviction. The section makes it quite clear that the grant will not be paid even if the conviction occurred prior to the commencement of this provision, the claim was made prior to the commencement of this section or the claim was made before the conviction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats particularly welcome the encouragement being given to businesses in the early stages of developing their export markets. The bill seeks to achieve this by proposing a new section 13A, which allows claims to be lodged on a half-yearly basis in the first three years of grant eligibility. This should reduce the delays between incurring expenditure and payment of the grant, which is of course crucial in assisting the cash flow and viability of smaller businesses. There are many other technical amendments throughout this bill to incorporate this proposed system of first-half payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that the scheme should provide assistance primarily to small businesses which are just getting on their feet. Therefore, we welcome the provision which stops payment of the grant where a claimant's export earnings exceed $25 million for a full-year claim or $12.5 million for the first-half claim. There is, of course, the question as to whether this ceiling should in fact be lower to channel more resources to companies that are smaller, with a smaller turnover, but have the potential for growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision giving exporters access to additional grants beyond the general eight-grant limit was inserted in the act last year. It applies when they have incurred eligible expenditure for new markets. Clause 20 of this bill proposes to amend section 15 to limit the categories of activity eligible for this extension of grants. In large measure, this provision was necessary because of drafting errors which occurred in the original bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address the point that I foreshadowed as to whether this scheme really provides sufficient assistance to companies and individuals at the lower end of the scale, in the small business sector. The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1990 increased the minimum expenditure threshold from $10,000 to $30,000. Only two years prior to that it had been increased from $5,000 to $10,000. Furthermore, that amendment made the first $15,000 ineligible for a grant. At the time, the Australian Democrats opposed these amendments in the firm conviction that this cut out a lot of people at the lower end of the business scale who, as events have proved, do have extremely good potential for unlocking export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow the following questions to the minister. Has the government assessed the effect of these amendments?  How many companies which do have potential have been cut out from this scheme?  Does the government intend to review the scheme, particularly these threshold levels which have been increased?  I have received a number of complaints from companies that in the early stages of their export activities they cannot possibly finance their expenditure to the threshold levels which the government has introduced. Apart from this fact, which looks into the future of the scheme and its usefulness, I put on record that the Australian Democrats will support this legislation. </PARA>

The EMDG scheme is very important, and vitally so to many businesses in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, business in Australia is about high costs and low productivity. We must try to overcome these things by encouraging people to invest more and improve their plant by extending their markets and so on. They have to get out and find out what productivity is in the rest of the world. We talk a lot about being part of a world economy, but we are doing nothing about trying to catch up with it. This is one avenue that we can use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be able to see why people should invest in Australia. I noticed yesterday that my colleague Senator Gibson stated that PDL Holdings, Heinz, Gillette, Unilever, Kraft, Shiseido, Johnson and Johnson, Alcatel and Mars have recently chosen to invest in New Zealand instead of Australia. Why? They can do better in business there. In New Zealand, they can employ and invest and get a reasonable return. We have to compete with New Zealand and other countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at our costs compared with those of New Zealand. Look at the crazy things that add to our on-costs. Earlier in the week, we talked about an $8 per week wage increase. It may be an $8 per week increase for a handful of people in Australia's economy, but it is $12 or $13 for the people who keep Australia afloat, which is those who employ and invest. Nobody seems to consider what $8 per week means to the people who are paying the money. All the government rake-offs that go on the end of it make it quite uneconomical in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How are the producers of Australia to expand? There must be an EMDG scheme or something similar. Thinking back tonight, I guess that I would have spoken 20 times on EMDG legislation since I have been here. In that time, there have probably been over 100 amendments to it. How can business people in Australia possibly cope with legislation that changes two or three times a year, year after year? How can one plan when one does not know how long anything will last? It is crazy. But still, that is the way we have run it in the past and it is the way that we will apparently continue to run it under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can business plan? Why do not government members do something about it? I look across the other side of the chamber, when any of them are present, and wonder how they could know. I do not know how many of them have ever employed one person in a productive capacity. I just do not know how we can expect them to know more when they have not had the experience. It is important that honourable senators understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have lain awake at night wondering where the next day's pay for 40 or 50 men will come from when there is not enough money in the bank. There are those who wonder what they will do when an overseas order has been cancelled and the product is ready to shift. Others wonder how they will compete with something that is coming in from New Zealand at a 30 per cent lower price because the shipping costs, as we saw in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Commercial News</EMPHASIS> this week, are 50 per cent less if they deal with New Zealand rather than Australia. How many government members have had to compete with that sort of thing? How do they know what is involved in running a business of this sort?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We just glibly pass a bit of legislation and say, `We will fiddle with the EMDGs again and that will be right'. But it is not like that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have never wondered how they will pay their business's tax, cope with the recession or look after an employee who is having a bad time really would not know. For people on the receiving end or in a non-productive occupation, it does not show. They do not know until they compete with the real world in either exporting or importing. Until they have employed and paid workers year after year, irrespective of whether things are good or bad, they do not know what it is like. So we fiddle with the legislation and make a mess of it once again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 has the intention of bringing Australia's maritime zones into line with those to which Australia is entitled under international law, as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention. Primarily, this bill amends the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. I note that the explanatory memorandum produced for the benefit of honourable senators and members also conveniently states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and a number of other Acts to replace references to the 1958 Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Conventions with references to comparable provisions in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention.</PARA>
<PARA>Having said that it amends the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 and a number of other acts, it might be worth drawing the attention of honourable senators to the range of acts that need to be amended in some way in order for this purpose to be achieved. There are quite a few of them: the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973, the Admiralty Act 1988, the Customs Act 1901, the Designs Act 1996, the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the Migration Act 1958, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981, the National Museum of Australia Act 1980, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Pipeline Authority Act 1973, the Quarantine Act 1908, the Sea Installations Act 1987, and the Whale Protection Act 1980. So the outline on the first page of the explanatory memorandum perhaps does not give a fair enough indication of how much work is involved in making this sort of change, namely, to bring Australia's maritime zones into line with those to which we are entitled under international law, as reflected by this 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background or purpose of the bill is this: in 1982 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, otherwise referred to as the 1982 convention, was adopted and signed by Australia. Australia has not yet ratified that convention. That 1982 convention needs 60 ratifications to come into force. At present, as we understand it, it has 56 such ratifications and therefore is quite likely to enter into force in the near future. Apart from the provisions relating to the mining of the deep seabed, it is generally accepted as reflective of international law. The government puts the view that, in relation to the maritime zones, the 1982 convention should in fact govern Australian practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Seas and Submerged Lands Act, which is the act which is primarily amended by this bill, currently refers to the 1958 Geneva conventions on the territorial sea and continental shelf. At the moment, consultations are taking place in an attempt to overcome some of the difficulties that have arisen under the 1982 convention in relation to the provisions dealing with deep seabed mining. As I understand it, the government has indicated that, if these consultations are successful, Australia will then be in a position to give serious consideration to ratifying the convention. According to the government, therefore, it is appropriate now for us to amend our domestic law to bring our practice in relation to maritime zones into conformity with those provided for in the 1982 convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979 Australia established a 200 nautical mile fishing zone. In 1983 certain territorial sea baselines were proclaimed by Australia. In 1990 a 12 nautical mile territorial sea was established in place of the previous three nautical mile territorial sea. The current bill will replace the operative provisions in Commonwealth legislation which refer to those 1958 conventions and put in, as I said, references to the 1982 convention. The bill makes it clear that Australia seeks to assert the full rights to which it is entitled under international law in a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated in the preamble of the bill, the rights that Australia has in such a zone include not just sovereign rights over both living and non-living resources but also jurisdiction as provided for in international law in relation to the establishment and use of artificial islands, installations and structures, marine scientific research and the protection and preservation of the marine environment. The sovereign rights and the jurisdiction which a coastal state possesses in its exclusive economic zone in regard to these matters are set out in detail in the 1982 convention, the relevant parts of which form a schedule to this bill. According to the government, it will be for future legislation to deal expressly with matters such as pollution control in the exclusive economic zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also adopts the definition of the continental shelf in the 1982 convention. The 1958 convention defines the outer limit of a continental shelf in terms of a depth of 200 metres or beyond that to a depth capable of exploitation. Customary international law has recognised that the limit of the continental shelf is the edge of the continental margin and that it does not include the deep seabed. The 1982 convention contains in article 76 a precise definition of a continental shelf. This is a minimum 200 nautical miles regardless of the physical configuration of the shelf. Beyond that distance, where the configuration of the continental shelf allows, however, the limit may extend to a distance not exceeding 350 nautical miles from the baseline or 100 nautical miles from the 2,500 metre isobath. This limit is calculated either by reference to the depth of sediments or the distance from the foot of the continental slope defined by the gradient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adoption of the 1982 convention will enable Australia to claim a larger total area of continental shelf than we have been able to do under the 1958 convention. According to the government, the gains made by adopting this new definition outweigh any of the minor potential losses and will in fact bring Australian legislation into conformity with internationally accepted principles. The bill also deals quite expressly with a contiguous zone. This zone extends from the limit of the territorial sea to a distance no greater than 24 nautical miles from the territorial sea baselines. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with this bill is that it applies to young persons above the age of 15. For example, the Victorian Attorney-General claims that the provisions in the area of obtaining fingerprints will bring the state of Victoria into line with the provisions that obtain in other states. I have had a search conducted and found that this is simply not true. In most other states there is a requirement for a court order, the order of a magistrate or the authorisation of the officer in charge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators may recall the speech I made some weeks ago in relation to a lady by the name of Nola Sillars. Nola Sillars took her life out of frustration while waiting for the Australian Securities Commission to deal with her request for information which was lodged under the Freedom of Information Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of my address I read to the Senate portions of a letter sent to me by the Australian Securities Commission dated 15 September 1993. This was just a couple of days after Nola Sillars took her life. Honourable senators will know my anger and frustration over that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I received another letter from the Australian Securities Commission signed by the Regional Commissioner&mdash;I assume for Western Australia&mdash;Mr Murray Allen. I wish to read this letter to the Senate because it does not improve the situation. It states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to my letter dated 15 September 1993 to Lisa Gates of your office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been brought to my attention that the fifth paragraph on page 2 of that letter does not accurately reflect the Commission's position regarding the availability under FOI legislation of reports provided to the Commission pursuant to Corporations Law s533 or (Companies Code s418). The Commission has in fact in the past considered the release of such reports both in general and in particular circumstances. In some cases the report has been released and in other cases the report has been considered exempt from release.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every application pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act must of course be considered on its merits and in the particular context.</PARA>

<PARA>That is a stunning piece of information because the letter it sought to correct was one which was written to me to pass on to Nola Sillars saying that the commission had not had cause to examine whether section 533 reports or section 418 reports under the companies code could be released under FOI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the commission is saying, `Well, in fact, we have looked at this matter before both in general and in particular.

It still has not said whether this information in this particular case should or should not be released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter is nothing short of an insult in the way in which it deals with this matter&mdash;in its insensitivity and in its failure to progress the matter any further.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a couple of matters tonight. Firstly, I want to comment on Senator Sandy Macdonald's remarks about the return of the unknown soldier on 11 November, which will mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the First World War. It is a moving tribute to the sacrifice of those 60,000 young Australians who died in the First World War&mdash;all of them far away from Australia. About 47,000 of those soldiers died in France.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s I had the opportunity to make a private visit to France, and I made the effort to visit Villers-Bretonneux, Amiens and the River Somme to see the war graves of the Australian forces. It is a particularly moving and sombre experience to visit Villers-Bretonneux and see something like 10,000 to 11,000 names engraved on the wall of that Australian war cemetery. Those Australians died in the epic battle of March and April 1918. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think most Australians realise that that battle was in fact a turning point in the First World War and that it was the Australian divisions that stopped the last gasp German advance that nearly won the war for Germany in early 1918. In fact, when the whole of the British 5th Army disintegrated, the Australian divisions were marched from Flanders and around Passchendaele south to Villers-Bretonneux. They went straight into battle and stopped the German advance. Then on 25 April 1918, in a major counter attack, the Australian divisions defeated the Germans around Villers-Bretonneux and started the German retreat. This was the turning point of the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most moving to be at Villers-Bretonneux and to see the memorial and the streets named after towns in Australia and to witness the respect which the local French people have for the Australian forces and those who died there. All the way along the Amiens-Cambrai road for nearly 60 miles there are various Australian war graves for the various divisions of Pozieres and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald's remarks were very appropriate and we all support them. The ceremony on 11 November will be a very fitting one. I hope that it helps Australians to understand their history&mdash;the extraordinary contribution that Australians made in the First World War and their sacrifices. In proportion to the size of our population our casualties were about the heaviest. It should also be remembered that every soldier who died in France and elsewhere overseas was a volunteer. The rest of the armies of Europe were raised by conscription. All the Australian soldiers volunteered to go and fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When visiting Villers-Bretonneux some weeks ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made this point to the French when discussing their present agricultural policies. He said that if he had told these young Australian volunteers defending French sovereignty that their contribution would be paid back by France's present economic policies they might not have been so keen to go. I think it is worth pointing out to the French that in the two world wars Australians have laid down their lives to defend the French and French sovereignty and to liberate France. I wish the French would remember that. Nevertheless, the ceremony on 11 November will be a very moving moment. I think Senator Macdonald is to be congratulated on his remarks tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I wanted to mention briefly relates to an area in my portfolio. It has come to my attention tonight that Dr David Kemp, the shadow minister for science technology and export development, has issued a statement based on a speech he made in the adjournment debate last night in the House of Representatives. It attacks remarks I made&mdash;or was reported to have made&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 22 October. The paper claimed that I said scientists were `grey haired men in cardigans'. What the story in the press failed to do was give the context and explain where I made those remarks. I want to put the record straight on the context of those remarks not only for Dr Kemp but also everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, on Thursday, 21 October, I had a meeting with some of the youth ANZAAS congress 1993 delegates. They were a group of young people who attended the ANZAAS congress 1993 in Perth. About 300 young people from high schools and secondary schools around Australia attended the congress. Most of them came from Western Australia. At the end of the congress, four of them were elected to make a report to me about their impressions of the congress and ways to improve the role of young people in science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Thursday of last week four of them came to Canberra and presented me with a very good report on the impressions and issues with respect to young people and science. It was the most well-written and precise report that one could hope to receive. In the discussion with them that followed, at which some science journalists were present, including one from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, one of the issues that the delegates raised was the lack of women being encouraged to pursue a career in science. The youth delegates believed that this was due to there being a lack of role models of women in science for other women to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that discussion, I did say that, when one observes science meetings, one cannot help but have an impression that science is overwhelmingly made up of grey-haired men in cardigans, in view of the lack of women</PARA>
<PARA>who are not represented in science. That is the context in which I made the comment. It was not in any way meant to denigrate the role of scientists, as Dr Kemp remarked that it was. Of course, he based that on a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> that did not put into context my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not resile from the fact that I have consistently argued for programs to raise women's consciousness of&mdash;and encourage them to go into&mdash;science and engineering courses. I will continue to do so. I think those professions are diminished by not having an appropriate balance of our women members of society participating. For Dr Kemp, and even the journalist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, who had a very brief story which took my remark out of context, I hope that clears things up. I hope the science community sees that I am more interested in getting women into science than I am in making comments denigrating male scientists. </PARA>
