<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the President, I make the following statement. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has raised with the President a matter of privilege, and asked that he consider whether a motion to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges should be given precedence in accordance with standing order 81.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter raised by the Public Accounts Committee is the alleged adverse treatment of a witness, Mr John Richardson, in consequence of his giving evidence before the committee. The committee indicates that it believes that Mr Richardson has been penalised in consequence of his evidence, and that the committee has collected some evidence in relation to this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will recall that Mr Richardson made three submissions to the Senate in which he has referred to certain proceedings before Estimates Committee A relating to the same matters as were the subject of inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee. His submissions, dated 17 and 19 February and 30 April 1992, were tabled on 25 February and 4 May 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the President has indicated in previous statements, the matter of alleged interference with witnesses is regarded with great seriousness. He considers that the letter from the Public Accounts Committee indicates that this matter meets the criteria which he is required to take into account in determining whether a motion should have precedence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He therefore determines that a motion may have precedence in accordance with standing order 81 to refer to the Privileges Committee the matter raised by the Public Accounts Committee in relation to Mr Richardson. I table the letter from the Public Accounts Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Accounts Committee has indicated that Senator Watson, the Deputy Chairman of the committee, will take carriage of the matter in the Senate. Senator Watson has raised with the President as a matter of privilege the claims set out in Mr Richardson's submissions that false answers were given to the Senate and to Estimates Committee A.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These claims also raise a very serious issue, and also clearly meet the criteria which the President is required to consider. The President therefore determines that a motion to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee may have precedence under standing order 81. The President refers the Senate to Mr Richardson's submissions which were previously tabled. Senator Watson may therefore give notice of a motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The invitation made to us by the new Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, is quite improper. It is more than unreasonable; it really is improper. I will come back to that in just a moment. The first point the Minister made was that it is unfortunate that we would not agree to this motion being treated as formal today, and simply pass it through on the nod, in effect. We have always said that this is a serious issue. We have said that we are prepared to debate it properly, and debate it properly through to a final resolution. Some of us are on the record as saying that the principle is correct and that we believe there should be a form that sets out details of interests in order that the public can have confidence in the system. But we have every right to debate the detail in this place and determine it in a form that is satisfactory to the Senate, not a form that is satisfactory to the Minister or to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to the shortcomings of the Government's form in a minute. What it really demonstrates is that the Government has no genuine interest in setting up a register in a form that is fair and reasonable and that will work. It simply wishes to play politics with this issue and it does so every couple of years. Senator Evans has made the latest attempt. He is one of a series of government leaders who, every few years, comes in to this place and says, `I am different from the last. I will take this issue seriously. I am putting it on the table. We will pursue it'. He has put down the matter today and he has lost interest in it already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been back here for a fortnight. We spent the whole of the last fortnight debating the Government's procedural issues. We spent hours and hours in this place debating whether or not speeches should be reduced from 30 minutes to 20 minutes. We could have been debating this issue if it had been given the priority which the Minister came in here today and said it had. It demonstrates that there is no real good faith in what the Minister is seeking to do today. It is not a priority of the Government's; if it were, the Government would have given it priority last week or the week before over all of those other procedural matters that it thought were so important. That is why we are not simply going to agree that the motion be declared formal and that it go through without debate. Senator Alston is telling me I have an important phone call which would probably be more useful than what it is going on here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point relates to the content of the document which the Government has put before us. It is still, in so many ways, meaningless. For example, the document refers to `a holding company or a private company'. This is the problem with the disclosure document of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); it is totally meaningless. It tells us and the public absolutely nothing about his real financial interests. What is the point of having a form of disclosure that is ineffective? That is one of the debates we wanted to have on the last occasion, but the Government did not want to pursue the issue, so it did not debate it. If there is to be a form, it has to be an effective form. The Minister should think about it. What is the point of us knowing about `Gareth Evans Pty Ltd' and that the Minister is a shareholder in it? We do not know what its interests are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It says in the document that one has to list beneficial interests in trusts. Does that include discretionary trusts? What is the meaning of that? Are we seriously trying to get behind the sorts of fronts that the Prime Minister has for his business interests to work out not only where there is a potential conflict of interest but also where there is a real conflict of interest?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now get to the Minister's last point: he is going to ask us to voluntarily fill in his form. That is not the way to do business in this place. If the Senate wants to set up a structure and a form that has been agreed by the Senate, so be it, but for the Minister to come in and say, `I'm going to invite senators to fill in a form which I think is appropriate' is really quite offensive and unreasonable. What has he said? He has invented the notion that we should lodge it with the President. Why the President? This motion says that details have to be provided to the registrar of Senate interests, but of course there is not a registrar of Senate interests. There is also to be a committee of senators' interests to protect the interests of senators under the Government's own mechanism, but of course that committee does not exist at the moment. It is not to be tabled by individual senators but by the chairman of the committee of senators' interests at the start of each Parliament. That is all inappropriate in these circumstances. </PARA>

It is a totally stupid idea. We do not know exactly what is required, yet we are supposed to put in something by Wednesday. What is more, things change from day to day.

For example, last week I might have given my stockbroker instructions to try to get this for that or buy this or sell that. I will not really know whether he has done it or not.

That is just a classic example of how, behind the facade of respectability presented by this kind of statement, we get a complete misleading of the Parliament and the people in respect of his specific interests. For example, in reading that declaration of interest by the Prime Minister we would not know that he had an interest in a matter which related to joint ventures with multinational operations. </PARA>

This is putting in a form which provides, firstly, hiding from reality; secondly, misleading people; and, thirdly, removing an obligation to declare a member's interest whenever a matter is before the chamber because that member can say, `I have declared it generally in a form which is held somewhere by the bureaucracy of the chamber'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, I would much rather see a situation where the sort of integrity that has existed forever in this chamber was maintained because, while we have a pressure for personal proper behaviour here in being required to state a potential for conflict of interest, people will address their minds to it and behave properly, as they always have in the past.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very serious erosion of senator's rights and responsibilities in reducing their right to speak for 30 minutes to 20 minutes during the second reading debate. That was a matter that a lot of senators took very seriously. Many speeches&mdash;as was proven from the facts put forward&mdash;take less than 20 minutes to deliver, but now and again some speeches take 30 minutes. To suggest that we should come into the chamber and merely agree to that issue in 10 seconds, because that is what the Government wants, is just not the way to run the Senate.

To suggest that senators should come into the chamber and just agree to that proposal without having the opportunity to debate it is to deny the right of the Senate to be a legislative chamber.

Senators can have millions in a family trust or some sort of a trust and merely disclose that they have an interest&mdash;a quarter interest, one-eighth interest or one share&mdash;in a family trust, which conveys absolutely nothing about what their financial situation is or what their interests are. Other senators may have shares or own property, and others may have only debts.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One pig farm, as Senator Alston says. The other point that Senator Baume made was on the question of integrity. The normal concepts of integrity are destroyed once we say to people, `Fill in this little form and you can do as you like'. That is clearly what has happened. I refute and resent the way we have been spoken about by the Government on this issue. I certainly reject this concept that by putting in a form by Tuesday morning everything will be okay, and the implied threat associated with that, especially when we read the motion and know the sorts of penalties that Senator Faulkner has in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This four-page motion poses some reasonable questions that we are entitled to have answered before complying with the provisions it will impose, especially in view of the penalties for non-compliance, such as incurring the contempt of the Senate for getting something wrong. I could give a $100 cheque to a junior soccer team in my electorate to go on a trip to Darwin or somewhere and finish up in contempt of the Senate if I missed that cheque when going through my electorate accounts. What an absurd situation. It is time the Government had a close look at the definitions needed for this sort of procedure and the information that senators are entitled to before they are asked to fill in such a form. Instead, Senator Evans comes into the chamber and simply says, `Fill this in'. I do not have time between now and next Tuesday to go through my electorate account cheque books and check whether there are $100 cheques which need to be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously Senator Evans does not have enough to do with his time if he is able to spend from now until next Tuesday checking off all the receipts and cheques from his electorate account to prepare the form for next Tuesday. It is outrageous to suggest that that should be done with a motion such as the one we have before us. It should be properly debated and dealt with. I resent the way in which Senator Evans has behaved. He came into this chamber, dropped this proposal on the Senate, stayed for 10 minutes, and then drifted off. He was not even interested in hearing or becoming seriously involved in the debate. He has merely tried to waste the time of the Senate and to that end he has been successful. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill gives legislative power to a Registrar to obtain from industries using toxic chemicals information pertaining to their use, storage, handling, transportation, recycling and manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will not only provide for a National inventory of all toxic chemicals currently in use in Australia, but also the information relating to the health and environmental effects of toxic chemical use, reports from industry of toxic chemical releases, the production and disposal of toxic chemicals, reports on the emergency procedures that are in place and reports on methods of reducing the use of toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important and fundamental object of this legislation however, is that all this information is to be made freely available to the community through the Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is stressed that this Bill by no means overrides any other Acts. It does however make a significant contribution to enabling the free access of information to the community. Like the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989, and the National Occupational Health and Safety Act, this legislation will encourage uniformity of regulation by the States and Territories&mdash;something which is well overdue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is through the recent experience of Coode Island in Melbourne, that we have been reminded of the urgent need for this Legislation. This experience highlights clearly the necessity for the formal dissemination of information concerning toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had this Legislation been in place before the Coode Island disaster, not only would the people of Melbourne's western suburbs have been properly informed as to the exact nature of the chemical release, but the emergency services, media and the rest of Melbourne threatened by the plume of toxic smoke would have been informed as to the health effects and emergency procedures to be put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact the final report of the Independent Coode Island Review Panel (March 1992) recommended that,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"the Government agree in principle to a legislated Community Right to know to assist public understanding of hazardous materials and the production processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no such formal legislative power at either State or Federal level in place at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently if someone wants to obtain information about toxic chemicals they go through the State Environment Protection Authority using the F.O.I. Act. This process has developed an inertia all of its own as ordinary people are expected to negotiate a bureaucratic minefield. Quite often the information is decided on a case by case basis (NSW), or the information is hidden behind the veil of trade secrecy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Legislation should not be considered to be an extension of F.O.I. It goes further by establishing the doctrine that toxic chemicals information affects the whole community and as such the community has the right to obtain such data. It will no longer be the privilege of those whose vested interest it is to keep this information out of the public gaze.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my state of Victoria there are a number of Legislative provisions which limit information about chemicals to the public. For example information on the types and quantities of chemical products is not available except through The Dangerous Goods Act and Dangerous Goods (Storage and Handling) Regulations 1989 which require appropriate HAZCHEM signs displayed on site or during transportation of chemicals. This provision is solely to assist emergency services and not predicated on any public interest principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is not enough information on these signs to adequately inform the public of emergency procedures or health effects in case of disaster. Other Victorian legislation deal only with very limited and specific aspects of chemical use eg. The Agricultural Preparations Act 1958.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill would centralise all information pertaining to toxic chemicals. It would establish a collection point where the community can access information without the maze of bureaucratic red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Chemical Industry Council (ACIC) proposes, under its Responsible Care Program, implementing Community Right To Know as part of their 10 codes of practice. Questions are raised however, as to the effectiveness of such a proposal when there are a number of qualifications which compromise its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, certain aspects such as emergency planning would be limited to discussion in consultative panels with plant management. The extent to which the information is disseminated would be confined to these panels and not to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the right to know would be subject to certain protections of privacy and commercial confidentiality and as yet there are no safeguards against abuse of those limitations to cover-up information which if publicly available would be a cause for concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is aimed at ensuring that the public is assured of the Right to Know while protecting commercial interests within clearly defined limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This overview has briefly highlighted the inadequacies of the current procedure for the public to obtain information on toxic chemicals and the dangerous precedent of allowing the chemical industry to initiate their own Community Right To Know policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major elements of the Bill include;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1) The establishment of a Registrar, who collects information, as contained in the Objects of the Act, from the chemical industry and makes that information available to the public upon request. This will be done through the creation of an on-line data base, available at local libraries, a 008 phone number or through application to the Registrar's office. Studies both in Australia and overseas have shown that the chemical industry is unwilling to respond directly to community requests for information. Through the establishment of an independent Registrar these barriers will be taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only recently thirty companies in Melbourne were surveyed asking for information. To the shame of the industry only eight even responded. Fifteen of these companies belonged to the Chemical Industry body which claims to have its finger on the pulse when it comes to community health and safety concerns. Again if we look at the chemical accidents in the western suburbs of Melbourne 60% (19 out of 32) of all incidents were perpetrated by ACIC members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2) Provision of information about emergency procedures, health and environment effects and reports on releases of toxic chemicals for public perusal and comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the environment would benefit greatly from the introduction of this Legislation. As a result of the publicly accessible data base and telephone hotline, the public would be able to discover hitherto secret information about toxic releases from chemical facilities. Facilities would report toxic releases to air, water and land. Already in the United States since the introduction of the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act in 1986,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"the national toxins release inventory indicate that releases of toxic chemicals have decreased approximately 20% on average since 1987. In the State of California, chemical companies have completely stopped emitting six hazardous chemicals and emissions have decreased for two-thirds of all chemicals for which data is available. "(Adams, P and Ruchel M. Unlocking the Factory Door! The Community Demands the Right to Know. Report to the Coode Island Review Panel; Hazmag March 1992.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3) Public involvement throughout the process of implementing and developing the framework provided for in this Legislation. For example, the Registrar will, in consultation with industry and community bodies, develop codes of practice regarding the safe production and use of toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously industry self-regulation, although attempting to have the community's interests at heart, does not have the required commitment to work openly with the public. This Legislation would make the chemical industry more accountable to the community. Through the provisions in the Bill the public can find out what chemicals a business is using. The Legislation would guarantee public access to chemical information for use in emergency response, pollution prevention and/or control and local community information or action groups. The information would also be useful for land use planning, insurance, property transfer or any other public purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should alert the Senate to the fact that the Bill has been subject to many months of community consultation. I am indebted to Mr Matt Ruchel of the Hazardous Chemicals Group in particular for assistance with the research which went into the initial draft. Mr Simon McRae of the highly respected international environmental organisation Greenpeace has also played a leading role in assisting me with the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task of preparing a Private Senator's Bill is a great challenge because by its very nature it has to be prepared without the massive resources and expertise available to Government. In the case of this Bill, I doubt if it would have been possible to present it in time for the end of our 1992 sittings without the help of a Social Work Student Mr Tom O'Donnell, who was on placement in my office from July until October. Tom played a key role in involving community organisations with preparation of the draft and receiving responses once that draft was circulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this very comprehensive consultative process a large number of suggestions have been made to my office for the improvement of this Bill. In particular, there have been proposals to tightly regulate the availability of commercial secrecy provisions to ensure they are not used to avoid disclosure of information about chemicals to the Registrar. These proposals have been borrowed from other jurisdictions where they have been effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill represents an important step forward in the protection of the health and safety of Australians and the environment in which we live. It is an attempt to bring us up to speed with other parts of the world where there is now a realisation that both the environment and the human race are gravely at risk of extinction if we fail to develop a sustainable approach to the way we live. I look forward to the public debate which this Bill aims to engender with the resultant response from the Labor and Coalition parties as they grapple with the community's expectation that they place the health and safety of people and their living environment ahead of the profits of the large corporations which have come to rely so heavily on the chemical industry. This conflict is not new. Indeed, in the next decade, I doubt there will be any other political dynamic which will so dominate the thinking, discussion and action of our nations body politic. I look forward to further community response to the Bill and commend it to the Senate.</PARA>

In seeking leave to withdraw my notice of motion, I welcome the fact that the Senate has accepted the Liberal and National parties' demand that the Australian Citizenship Amendment Bill be given the careful and proper consideration it requires and, as well, to involve the Australian community in the desirable consultation processes. That would not have been possible under the Government's initial proposal which was to rush the Bill through the Parliament. The Bill seeks to abolish the oath or affirmation of allegiance made by new citizens on the grant of citizenship and to replace it with a so-called pledge that omits any reference to the Crown, the Constitution or any of our basic national institutions without consultation, and in a pre-emptive, pre-emptory and divisive manner. The fact that the Senate will now be considering the Bill in its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs over the next couple of months and reporting back to the Senate at the start of the next session is a welcome development.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Regulation 51 of the Austudy Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1992 No. 399 and made under the Student Assistance Act 1973, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion is very similar to the disallowance motion I moved last year relating to the increase in the minimum payment to students under Austudy. Last year the Government, as part of its 1991 Budget, increased the minimum payment to $5. This year it will increase the minimum payment to $20 per week. That means that the minimum possible payment that a student could receive under Austudy is $1,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many people, that might not sound like a great deal of money, especially when it is fragmented into 52 payments of $20 per week, but for many families, especially low income families and larger middle income families with children at secondary school or attending tertiary studies, whose income is slightly higher than would be the case if they qualified for full Austudy, $1,000 a year is a tremendous sum of money. It represents the cost of purchasing textbooks, uniforms, transport and all the other costs associated with education which have so greatly increased for so many families over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Government is seeking to ensure that administration costs in relation to Austudy are reduced. In relation to this particular measure, I went to see the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) last year to see if there was some way that administrative savings could be made without disadvantaging families, especially those middle income families with a large number of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Minister that perhaps a more streamlined way of dealing with the administrative burden of a large number of small payments would be to make these smaller payments in, say, two lump sums per year, one at the beginning and another half-way through the year. In that way larger middle-income families would not be disadvantaged by the loss of $1,000 per year in Austudy. On the other side of the coin the Government could certainly save some money through implementing what would be, in my mind, a very sensible administrative move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, to his credit, listened to what I had to say and gave my remarks some consideration, but I had the strong feeling that by that time the Budget had come down the $14 million saving had already been factored into the Government's Budget deficit and it was all too late to change. As a result we have this regulation before us today and I find myself once again seeking to disallow a very regressive measure which impacts hardest on those middle-income families with a large number of children at school. I refer to schools in particular because last year when this Budget measure was announced I asked the Minister then representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Senator Cook, how many students would be affected by this measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thirty-eight thousand&mdash;not 30,000, Senator Teague&mdash;students would be affected by the implementation of this measure. Of that 38,000, 8,000 are tertiary students and a massive 30,000 so affected are secondary students. I put it to the Senate that 30,000 students is a very large number. Therefore, this measure hits very hard those middle-income families with a large number of children at school&mdash;at school, not at university. This is a very serious measure which affects an enormous number of people who are struggling to make ends meet and facing higher living costs and higher costs of sending children to school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In implementing this particular Budget measure the Government was doing what we saw it do quite a bit last year&mdash;that is, it was picking the eyes out of the Fightback package. In Fightback the coalition proposed to lift the minimum payment from $20 per week to $30 per week, which would clearly have seen many more than the 38,000 students affected by this move cut off the Austudy list. In fact, it would have raised the annual minimum payment from $1,000 to over $1,600. I put it to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that, again for large families with children at school that represents a very large amount of money that will no longer come into the family budget and that this will seriously affect the capacity of those families to send their children to school and to meet all those ongoing small costs that doubtless these amounts of Austudy have been used to offset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would further submit that this is yet more evidence of the Government seeking to squeeze those middle-income families and larger families. It is seeking to gradually tighten up regulations and tighten up the Austudy budget in such a way as to seriously disadvantage many in our community. We have already seen this happen in a range of ways. Not only do we have this measure today, but last year we saw the implementation of yet another regulation which has meant that students are now slugged with a 20 per cent interest payment on Austudy overpayments. In reports to this chamber in the past, the audit office has indicated that there is a very serious deficiency of administration in the Department of Employment, Education and Training which has meant that many of these overpayments occur as a result of departmental bungling. Yet students are being asked to fork out additional interest payments if for some reason they are unable to meet their obligations, even when these overpayments occur due to genuine error or administrative bungling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the point I made to the Senate was that the impost of 20 per cent interest in fact bore no relation to current market interest rates and did not accurately correspond with the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as the Government last year purported it did. So once again we saw the Government penalising students with punitive measures and doing it through regulation rather than through legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the increasing incidence of regulation and delegated legislation is a very serious matter which must be dealt with by the Senate in coming years. We have seen this Government&mdash;and, I guess, all governments&mdash;move towards implementing policies through vast numbers of regulations which, of course, cannot be scrutinised by this chamber with the same degree of effectiveness as legislation can be. In fact, these particular regulations were tabled on the last day of sitting last year and have been in force since 1 January. The Government used the regulatory measure to get around the scrutiny of the parliament in the hope that nobody would notice. There was an election, and it thought that other things would take precedence, so it got away with simply delegating this responsibility once again to bureaucrats, thereby avoiding the scrutiny of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increasing incidence of, and tendency towards, regulation and delegated legislation must be stemmed. The Parliament, and particularly the Senate, must take this matter into its own hands. For example, I would like to see implemented a standing order or a procedural mechanism whereby a regulation could in fact be amended by this chamber rather than simply disallowed. I think that would be a far more positive way of having input to the legislative process than simply disallowing the regulation and saying to the department, `Go back and start again'. I would like to see us have much more input in actually redrafting and reforming regulations so that we can have much more control and much more scrutiny over what is being presented to us by departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have promised honourable senators that I will not continue my remarks for too long, because we have a lot of business to get through, and I understand that the Opposition will not be supporting this motion of disallowance. I remind the Opposition that this regulation is precisely the kind of measure that lost it government on 13 March. It is precisely this kind of punitive measure that the electorate rejected and which made the electorate wonder whether the coalition had a social heart. The coalition needs to go back to the drawing board and assess where it stands on social policy and the delivery of welfare in this country. If the coalition turns up to the next election with a document that is similar to Fightback, the electorate will reject its policies once again. The coalition has a lot of work to do. </PARA>

He knew that whenever he turned up to debate us on education policy he would be howled down and have to face student demonstrations and all the approbation that the coalition's policies deserved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sowada has moved to disallow a regulation giving effect to a government Budget decision which would increase the minimum payment under Austudy to $1,000 a year; it was previously $250. This is a savings measures and means that students whose allowance would have come to less than $1,000 on the means test taper do not receive any Austudy payment. Some 38,000 students are expected to be affected at an annual saving of $28.8 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, students in secondary courses would instead be entitled to receive a family payment of $10.35 a week from the Department of Social Security. Affected students in tertiary study would be entitled to an Austudy loan, known as a category 2 supplement, of $2,000. These special loans apply to students who are above the parental income test limit for an Austudy grant but who have a parental income of less than $50,000 a year. These loans require no trade-in of the Austudy grant, unlike the category 1 Austudy supplement, but clearly carry the same very generous interest and repayment provisions as normal Austudy loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher minimum payment was one recommendation that was developed as a result of last year's review of Austudy by Dr Bruce Chapman of the Australian National University. The review process involved wide consultation. The Government has adopted most of Dr Chapman's key proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of the proposal to increase the minimum payment is that a small allowance of less than $20 a week can never be critical to a student's decision to stay in education. The savings from this measure have been put back into Austudy in making improvements in other areas, such as lowering the age of independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992-93 Budget, the Government made significant improvements to Austudy and Abstudy, which are the major student support schemes. These improvements have provided more generous and flexible support to help alleviate the difficulties faced by many students. In particular, students will benefit from a lowering of the age of independence from 25 years progressively down to 22 years by 1995. In 1993, students will qualify from 24 years of age. For students reaching this age, the parental means test will not apply. In addition, a 20 per cent increase in the personal income test threshold will allow Austudy students to earn up to $6,000 in 1992-93 before affecting their entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA>Existing Abstudy cut-off points have also been increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new voluntary Austudy-Abstudy supplement will give eligible tertiary students the chance to trade in all or part of their grant up to a limit of $2,000 for double the amount of money. This is the category 1 supplement. Certain students who are not eligible for an Austudy or Abstudy allowance may nevertheless be entitled to the category 2 supplement, which I have discussed previously. The supplement is provided at no real rate of interest and is entirely optional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Existing allowances are now indexed so that they will keep pace with increases in the cost of living. This has been legislated for in the Student Assistance Act. These changes involved a significant increase in funds available for Austudy and Abstudy to about $1.5 billion in 1992-93. This was due to an estimated increase in the number of beneficiaries from around 510,000 to about 560,000, including those who will benefit from the Austudy-Abstudy supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Austudy was introduced in 1987, the number of students assisted has increased from 224,793 to 458,460 in 1992. In that period, expenditure has risen from approximately $539.8 million to $1,432.9 million. This matter was a Budget decision by the Government and was passed in Parliament in the Budget Bills. The regulation merely gives effect to the Budget decision. I oppose the disallowance motion that has been moved by Senator Sowada. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition does not support the disallowance motion moved this morning by Senator Sowada of the Australian Democrats. We believe the account Senator Faulkner has just given of the Budget decision is an accurate one and one that the Opposition supported at the time. Indeed, we wanted to go further and call for a proper review of Austudy. We welcome the Chapman review and the implementation of its major findings&mdash;that is, the loans scheme that has been added to Austudy. But we still believe that Austudy is not well managed. It still requires review to ensure that it is fair and is seen, especially by students, to be fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me focus on the Austudy question that is involved in the regulation that Senator Sowada's motion seeks to disallow. I must first refer to the principle of equal opportunity of access to education. The Liberal and National parties support very strongly equality of opportunity to education. Through student allowance schemes&mdash;through the support of students at tertiary and secondary levels&mdash;we wish to see equality of opportunity achieved. At the same time, it is our responsibility to be accountable to all taxpayers for the spending of their money in a way which is fair and balanced&mdash;in terms of the interests of students to have access to education, on the one hand; and the interests of taxpayers to have a minimum reasonable level of taxation, on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years the Democrats have consistently argued that all students should have access to Austudy. The Democrats are not happy with the independent rate of allowance. They want to see a vast extension of the numbers of students who would be free of the parental means test so that they could gain the Austudy allowance. At the moment, if students come from moderately or very wealthy families, they are not eligible for Austudy allowances because it is seen that they have a means of support from their parents' income&mdash;even if they are aged 18, 19, 20, 21 and so on. It is only at age 24 that they are deemed to be independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to be fair to the Democrats. On the one hand, they have consistently gone to campuses and said, `Write your cheque; tell us what you want. We'll support you; we'll give student allowances'. Then, on the other hand, they are embarrassed when all the promises they make to the electorate add up to a burden of billions of dollars in extra taxes which would be laid upon the Australian people. Indeed, the Democrats do understand that they are a high-taxing party. They did not want to see the tax cuts that have been put in place by the present Government. They did not want to see the tax cuts that the Liberal and National parties were offering. They want to have higher taxes and they want to have more schemes to benefit groups such as students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have called for additional benefits in one area&mdash;that is, for the children of rural families suffering as a consequence of the rural depression. Many students, tertiary and secondary, have been cut off from any Austudy benefit purely on the basis of the asset value of the farm, not because there is any income in the family. This has led to very serious deprivation for these students who have had to stop their studies. So in this area there is a need for more compassion on the part of the Labor Party and a recognition of the impact of the rural recession upon these families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the generality, I have debated education policies on campuses as much as any senator over the last 15 years. Senator Sowada referred to those of us who have debated on campuses. During the last election campaign I proudly went to all of the campuses in my State of South Australia and I defended the policies which I believed were going to improve the education outcomes for students. I did so alongside speakers from the Labor Party and speakers from the Democrats&mdash;the Democrats president and the second Senate candidate in South Australia, a young man who spoke very earnestly and very well for the Democrats alongside Senator Crowley and me on one such occasion. Other representatives of the Democrats also debated with me. I believed I was well received in the campuses of my own State of South Australia and I do not duck any debate at any time on any campus, especially when it is against the inadequacies of the Labor Government's provision for education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Collins. It is the case that there was some severe misrepresentation of coalition policy from Fightback on some of the campuses&mdash;especially with regard to so-called up-front fees, or the costs to students&mdash;put about by our opponents as the implication of Fightback being implemented on a Liberal-National Party government being elected. It was possible by direct contact with students to refute those lies, those misrepresentations, and to put clearly our policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not want to reinvent a debate which took place in February and March of this year; I want to say to senators that the coalition's policies remain and they are subject to review. All the unnecessary hooks in our policy that were intelligently rejected by students, staff or parents&mdash;and when I say intelligently, I mean with a proper appreciation of what was meant&mdash;can be identified. I urge my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties to make sure that we remove those hooks; we will then be able, in our dialogue with those members of the public over the next 12 months, to put forward all the more clearly the advantages that we took, even to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I press on to refer to the impact of the regulation before us. Let us refer to the initiative that began this decision of the Government. In the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, in March 1991&mdash;that is a little more than two years ago now&mdash;there was a very well considered report on student financial assistance. One of the matters that this committee unanimously agreed upon&mdash;and we must give some credit to a large, well established House of Representatives committee&mdash;was stated on page 18 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1988 and 1990 the proportion of students on part allowance has increased from 37 per cent to 56 per cent. This trend is even more pronounced at the secondary level where the proportion has increased from 32 per cent to 60 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, those who are not getting the full Austudy allowance, but only part of it. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET stated that these trends could not be explained by changes in the operation of Austudy. Many of these students would be receiving very small allowances. The Committee doubts if the payment of these small allowances has any effect on retention or participation rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, page 19 of the report shows the department's own view which is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austudy provides the financial assistance to permit people to make the decision to continue in education.</PARA>
<PARA>The Liberal and National parties have asserted for years that that is what the purpose of any sound student assistance scheme ought to be. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, traditional factors such as career choice, job opportunities and family perceptions can produce logical decisions to continue in education, once the issue of financial support is resolved. Financial assistance therefore plays a supporting but important role in the decision-making process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like Abraham arguing with God about his nephew Lot, we can then consider where the line ought to be drawn in terms of what small allowance, if it were to be withdrawn, would materially affect the decision of a student and the student's family as to that student continuing in secondary or tertiary education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee&mdash;and by implication the department itself&mdash;and certainly the coalition parties, and the Government through its Budget decision, have said that there will not be a significant change to enrolment if payments of $20 a week or less were removed. The money gained by removing the smallest allowances would enable better targeting of money to those students who were most in need to ensure that they had equality of opportunity and access to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada rightly referred to the 38,000 students affected by this decision made by the Labor Government in the last Budget. The decision was made following the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee and, as Senator Sowada again rightly said, following the policy decision made by the Liberal and National parties in 1991, in August 1992 the Government decided to do this in the Budget. The regulation was brought down in December, and that is the regulation Senator Sowada is seeking to disallow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That total of 38,000 students&mdash;which is made up of 30,000 students in secondary education and 8,000 students in tertiary education&mdash;who will be affected by this decision is to some extent balanced by an extra 52,000 who will be receiving Austudy for the first time because of the new eligibilities and the widening of Austudy's availability to those in greatest need. </PARA>

There has been a cutback and less money is available to those large families. All I can say is that the Government and the Liberal and National parties still regard that means test as fair, even if it is a reduction.

It is true that they took a clear policy to the election last March, but the Democrat vote went down from 13 per cent to four per cent. One of the reasons for that was the excessive taxation which would inevitably follow the implementation of the announced Democrat policies, including this one. I say on behalf of the Liberal and National parties that we will not be supporting the disallowance motion, and we call upon the Government to complete the review of Austudy so that it is seen to be well managed and fair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to congratulate Senator Sowada for having moved this motion to disallow section 51 of the Austudy regulations. The motion seeks to redress an injustice; to redress a blatant discrimination perpetrated by this Government and supported by the Opposition against large families, particularly&mdash;I notice Senator Panizza is in the chamber&mdash;those large families from the bush. Senator Sowada is trying to redress that injustice and discrimination. What the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner), who was previously at the table, said has virtually nothing to do with what Senator Sowada advanced for the disallowance of section 51 of the Austudy regulations, which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Living allowance is not payable to a student whose entitlement for the year . . . is less than $1,000, unless the student is properly receiving financial supplement under Part 4A of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That is $20 a week. So the Government is trying to cut down on those who are in receipt of $20 a week or less. As Senator Sowada said&mdash;and as I said last year in debates in this chamber on these matters&mdash;that means a lot to families with three, four and five students. It particularly means a lot to families in the bush with three, four or five students because, once we cut out the $20 a week or whatever it is, they are then no longer eligible for the incidentals, including the support for return visits to home each year. That is also scrapped by this regulation. So it is a double whammy against families with a number of sons and daughters who are students and, incidentally, who have to go away from home into the cities to attend tertiary or secondary educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very surprised to hear that the only response by the Opposition to this question is that it will not deter those families from sending their sons and daughters to tertiary or secondary education. That is just one point. But it is not the essential point. The essential point is a matter of pure and simple tax equity. It would be a different matter if families were able to claim a tax deduction for the money that is expended on the education of their children. But they are not entitled to claim that. Up to 1976 we were able to claim a tax deduction for the education of our children. That is no longer the case. It is extraordinary that it is no longer the case since recent developments in economic theory have emphasised the importance of investing in human capital. Australia needs to not only invest in creating future workers but also ensure that they are trained and skilled to match the best world standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear it repeatedly stated by Government members, over and over again, that one of the best ways of overcoming the drastic unemployment problem with which Australia is faced is to invest in human capital and the education and training of our young people. But when we try to do that, we find no taxation recognition of expenditure on education at all&mdash;none. That is an injustice. Unfortunately, the major expenses undertaken by parents in meeting the educational costs of their children are not recognised by the tax system. Businesses and businessmen can claim deductions for attending all sorts of seminars of more of less educational merit, but ordinary workers get absolutely nothing for the out-of-pocket expenses of educating their children. This injustice suffered by families because the taxation system will not recognise their educational expenses, needs to be placed on the priority list for consideration by the Government in this forthcoming Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point which I have made more stridently in recent times and that is the injustice of failing to acknowledge for taxation purposes the fact that an income is shared by a large number of people in a family where there are three, four, five or six children. I am not making any pleas so far as I concerned because I am not involved in Austudy at all. However, we need to look at the effects of the regulation which Senator Sowada has moved to disallow and the regulation which was introduced last year to change the sibling concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the situation of a farmer in the bush who has three children at university. The family income is $36,000 a year. What would happen if that farmer tried to earn an additional few dollars by pulling petrol or beer at the local servo? For every extra dollar earned, the children would lose 75c in their Austudy allowance, and the farmer would have to pay tax on the extra income. If his income were $36,000, he would be taxed at 46 per cent. He would have to pay 46c for every extra dollar he earns, plus 1.4 per cent of his income for the Medicare levy. For every extra dollar he earned, his children would lose about $1.25 in Austudy payments. There is not much merit in that, is there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of justice is there in the regulations when that situation exists?  People ought to have a good, hard look at what they are doing in this particular area. The reason why students lose 75c for every dollar earned is because of the change to the sibling concession. Honourable senators would remember that last year I moved for the disallowance of that concession. I was supported very strongly by Senator Sowada. The unfairness of that situation has gone over the heads of both government and coalition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a situation where 38,000 students are going to be affected. Those students are mainly from middle income, large family groups who are struggling to make ends meet. They are the ones who are battling. They are the ones who are paying their way. These people are the new poor. They sometimes have to rely on the St Vincent de Paul Society or the Salvation Army for help. Very often they are temporarily strapped for cash for a year or two because of their overcommitment to mortgage repayments and various other commitments. This is another attack on those families. It is a ludicrous situation. The Government is saying, `$20 is not much. It doesn't mean anything.' It means a heck of a lot to these people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I welcome your appointment as one of the Acting Deputy Presidents and wish you well as you occupy the chair in the weeks and months ahead. I was about to follow Senator Harradine on the earlier matter and say in very good faith that the effect upon siblings of the new measure that the Government has put in place should be very carefully considered. This is not precisely the disallowance motion put forward by Senator Sowada that was before the Senate. I, together with my colleagues Dr Wooldridge and Mr Andrews, will give every consideration to the fairness of hard cases and the sibling matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now address the motion before us, which is that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill 1993 and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993 be read a second time. On behalf of the Opposition, I note that we do not oppose the two measures but we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill. This amendment will provide that in addition to the 17 commissioners of ATSIC, who are elected through regional councils, there be a continuation of the two commissioners appointed by the Government and that the Chairman of ATSIC be appointed by the Government as one of the 19 commissioners who would comprise the commission. I now authorise the circulation of an amendment which stands in my name, copies of which I have already given to the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) and to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who represents the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin my remarks by applauding the degree of mature, bipartisan support which has developed in the Parliament over recent years, not least because of the good faith and carefulness of Minister Tickner and my close colleague Dr Michael Wooldridge, who was the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs in the last parliament. Those areas where there have been some sharp differences between both sides in policy have been clearly and forcefully argued by Dr Wooldridge and the coalition generally. But in the majority of areas&mdash;particularly those which touch upon the reconciliation process, making ATSIC genuinely workable and the outcome of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody&mdash;the  matters have been very maturely, carefully, sensitively and intelligently addressed by the Minister and the shadow Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that my colleague Mr Peter Nugent, as the new shadow Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, has already begun that positive and constructive process and will continue to do so during the life of this Parliament. The Minister is also continuing with his responsibility. The Opposition and the Government have a difference of view&mdash;I am happy to hear that the Australian Democrats hold the Opposition's view&mdash;about the need to have two commissioners appointed to ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I refer to my colleagues Dr Wooldridge and Mr Nugent, I note that it was the coalition's policy, during the last parliament&mdash;and we took this policy into the last election&mdash;that there be a reduction in the number of ATSIC commissioners and regional councils. Accordingly, on behalf of the coalition I welcome the Government's broad acceptance of the coalition's approach and I welcome the views expressed by the commissioners of ATSIC through its chairperson and my good friend, Miss Lois O'Donoghue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With the Government's approval, ATSIC set up a review of the operation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. For that review, the commission established a review steering committee which comprised several commissioners, including the chairperson; the chief executive officer of ATSIC, Dr Shergold; a special counsel from the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Willheim; and the First Assistant Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steering committee rightly focused on the continuing themes of this decade: empowerment and self-determination. It also focused on the practical question of overcoming any unnecessary complexity in the ATSIC Act and its administration to address difficulties that were arising so they could be overcome, and to ensure effective operation of the regional councils and ATSIC itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the report of the steering committee has the blessing of ATSIC and the regional councils. In fact, I have not heard of dissent amongst Aboriginal representatives about the report. The report called for a number of changes&mdash;the principal of which happened to have been outlined already in the policy of the Liberal and National parties&mdash;and these have now been accepted by the Labor Government. On that basis, it is of no real surprise to the Senate that I now support the intent of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the smaller size of the commission, in particular the smaller number of regional councils. This amending Bill shifts the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. The delineation of these new regions has been usefully set out in very colourful maps that have been produced by ATSIC and by the Minister. I am sure these maps are widely available to those honourable senators who are interested to see the new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The smaller number of regional councils makes it financially possible for the chairpersons of the 36 regions to fulfil their responsibilities full time. Instead of receiving a part-time salary, they will now receive a full-time salary. That means that they can put their minds and energies entirely to the task of representing their region and carry out, with their staff, the executive functions of each region. Whereas in the past there was a limited number of full-time commissioners&mdash;and, indeed, that applies even now&mdash;following the election of the new ATSIC commissioners later this year, all ATSIC commissioners will be full-time employees receiving full-time salaries. This will enable them to liaise with the regions they represent and to bring their full minds and energies to the work of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of these changes is that there is no additional financial call for the expenses of the regions and of ATSIC. There has been a sensible realignment of the expenses of this whole process so that the full-time commissioners will have the capacity to meet their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will elaborate on the Opposition's amendment when we get to the committee stage, but the principal reason for the coalition&mdash;and, I believe, the Democrats&mdash;urging the retention of two appointed commissioners in addition to the 17 elected is to enable flexibility in the avenues that are available for people to become members of the commission and for the overwhelming balance to be elected. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs may well need to ensure that there is some precise qualification in one of the commissioners, such as an accounting, management or legal knowledge. The Minister should be able to make sure that the commissioners have such a person among their numbers. Similarly, there should be flexibility&mdash;after consultation with the regions, the Opposition, a representative of the Democrats, the reconciliation commission and those other informed groups and persons in Australia&mdash;to appoint a chairman who may be the best appointment, even if not coming through the regional council and zone avenue to the ATSIC council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new feature of our amendment is that the appointed person can be drawn by the Minister from the elected members or drawn from one of the two that the Minister would be appointing to ATSIC. The Liberal and National parties do not wish to patronise, interfere or in any way diminish the self-management principle and the democracy principle of elected representatives from regions in the way that is fully provided for in the amending Bill. We move the amendment in the form that has been set out and circulated in the hope of ensuring that there are flexible capabilities and flexible avenues to being a member of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other reason for taking this initiative: in addition to the accountability mechanisms already in place, we believe that there will be an additional accountability mechanism for two members of ATSIC to have a special sense of responsibility to ensure that there is accountability for what is looking like about one per cent of Commonwealth expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. An amount of $100 billion is spent each year by the Commonwealth and about one per cent of that&mdash;towards $1 billion&mdash;is given to ATSIC for the needs of Aboriginal communities around Australia. That is a sizeable commitment of public moneys. There are already four or five accountability mechanisms in place and this initiative makes for another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to the second Bill&mdash;the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. The Opposition welcomes this measure, as it reflects agreement between all the parties involved. Three parcels of land will be added to the schedule of Aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. These three additions have been carefully discussed by all the relevant parties. The first parcel of land is in the Tennant Creek area&mdash;land known as the Kanturrpa-Kanttaji&mdash;and goes into the schedule as part of an agreement that secures Tennant Creek's water supply. It has the full support of the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority and the Central Land Council. Because there is such unanimity, this is a measure that ought to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and third areas are called Catfish Dreaming and Eva Valley. They are near Mount Todd. Agreement between the Northern Territory Government, the Jawoyn association and the mining company Zapopan NL makes it possible for a goldmining venture in that area of Mount Todd to proceed. We note the agreement with regard to Mount Todd and these two areas of land; therefore, we agree to the amendment. However, I note that some concern has been expressed by sections of the mining community about the Mount Todd land only. There have been concerns about threats made of pursuing land claims of a Mabo type which would have delayed an outcome. Some degree of compromise is involved to enable this to be more swiftly and clearly determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Background deals involving any degree of threat or lack of openness in the arrangements that lead to the Government bringing an amendment before us are always of concern to senators. I just express that concern because it is exceptional to have land added to the schedule in this way. It has not been of sufficient substance in its expression to us to lead us not to agree with the amending Bill that is before us. With those words, and noting that several of my colleagues will address these Bills, I support the second reading of the two Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will begin by making some comments to place the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill in context. Section 26 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 requires the commission to review the operations of the Act and report to the Minister with any suggestions for amendments to the Act. That is where we are at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the commission establish a review steering committee to oversee the conduct of this review. In carrying out its task, the steering committee gave particular attention to the need to focus on empowerment and self-determination, as emphasised in the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and, secondly, to the elements and structures established under the Act, their complexity and the administrative difficulties these structures place on the effective operation of the commission and regional councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steering committee tells us that it placed an emphasis on consultation with regional councils, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, government agencies involved in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs and the staff of ATSIC. But I have to note that this morning I received an urgent fax from Ms Esther Carroll, the chairperson of the Sydney regional council, who claims that that council has known of the existence of this Bill and the amendments for only a couple of days. I just want to put that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a first step in the consultation process, all regional councils&mdash;and Sydney says it was not&mdash;commissioners and management units within ATSIC were asked to provide information on technical and operational problems with the Act, general problems arising from the Act, problems relating to the electoral system which have arisen since the creation of ATSIC and the conduct of the first round of regional council elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have to acknowledge that in its only three years of existence ATSIC has demonstrated real commitment to accountability. I remember all the speeches that have been made in this place about our not being tough enough on this commission and not requiring the same accountability standards that we would require of similar bodies. I think it can be argued that in ATSIC's first period of operation it has demonstrated great commitment to accountability. ATSIC has made extremely difficult decisions. It has been proven that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations have not performed in such things as the acquittal of funds and service delivery of decisions they may have taken as councils. I have been very impressed with the strict accountability standards that we have seen from the chairperson and from the commissioners in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been agreement in a couple of areas. We agree on the reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. I think we can acknowledge that ATSIC has had a huge task in servicing the ordinary meeting needs of 60 regional councils. We also agree on the full-time appointment of commissioners and regional council chairpersons. It is a full-time job which dominates the lives of these people, and they deserve to be financially compensated and to have the status of full-time commissioners and council chairpersons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our one area of disagreement concerns how we arrive at the appointment of a chairperson of the commission. Rather than speak for others, I will quote Mr Terry O'Shane, whose views reflect the views of many Aboriginal people who have spoken to me on this issue. In a letter to the Minister, Mr Robert Tickner, dated 11 May 1993, Mr O'Shane said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of the election of the Chairperson is a very sensitive issue, the community of Cairns in four different meetings opposed this idea and recommended that the Chairperson remain as an appointment, we don't believe the process of self determination is served in any way at this early stage in the development of ATSIC.</PARA>

<PARA>He goes on to make what I think is a very telling observation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Aboriginal Affairs we don't join local political branches and seek nomination to the State executive and then the national executive or run in local elections and do time on the back bench before we challenge for the leadership, but you are saying&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that it will be alright for us to come in off the street, get the vote for regional council, challenge for the commission and if successful challenge for the Chairperson's job, I think you have a death wish concerning the ATSIC if you believe that we can elect the right person to that position at this stage . . . We believe that there are some special requirements the Chairperson would need, to handle the job effectively, these include a good working knowledge of the issues concerning Aboriginal People rural and urban, experience at a high level of administration, an ability to mix freely with foreign dignitaries and understand the protocol required on these occasions and to also understand the protocols when dealing with our own communities, this person would need to have their integrity intact and their honesty beyond doubt, they would need to have a proven track record in all areas, they would require the ability to give direction to the Commission, direction to the Commissioners and direction to the administration.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a tall order, I acknowledge. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to get someone without these abilities then we will see the total failure of the ATSIC, not only will the Commission not perform but it will come under increasing ridicule and if that happens you&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>Mr O'Shane says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have spoken to many people and they are fearful of the outcome if the election takes place for the Chairperson, they are also fearful of talking publicly for fear of being branded as opposing the process of self determination so its Catch 22.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a catch-22 situation. I am walking the tightrope of running the risk of being seen to be paternalistic while at the same time not wishing to take a well-intentioned action which I honestly believe would at this time seriously undermine the good work which ATSIC is doing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we in the Democrats are committed to finding the best solution here. I think the Opposition's amendment has something to recommend it. We only need to put this in place for a further three years. Many of the commissioners themselves have told me that this is what they prefer. It is very hard in Aboriginal politics, as we all know, to get one particular view which is stronger than another, as it is in our society. No one organisation represents white Australia's view on anything. But I have attempted to listen to the many and varied comments that have been made and I think that ATSIC would be better served in the short term if we were to adopt the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill is the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. As Senator Teague pointed out, the Bill proposes to include three additional parcels of land in schedule 1 of the principal Act. The inclusion follows agreement between the Minister, the relevant land trust and other affected bodies on uses of the land concerned and agreement not to pursue claims of native title that were successful in the Mabo case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the parcels of land relate to the Mount Todd goldmining project. The agreement between the Jawoyn Association, Zapopan NL and the Northern Territory Government will allow the project to proceed while title is granted under the principal Act. The agreement has been criticised by a number of mining companies as being a result of threats of protracted litigation on Mabo grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In anticipation of some comments on the Mabo case and the sort of beat-up that we are seeing in the press, I would urge members of the Opposition not to jump in&mdash;like so many others are&mdash;and say that one individual has an automatic right of protection over another. Mining companies have no more right of protection than do Aboriginal communities. I think it is appalling that premiers such as Mr Wayne Goss from my State of Queensland and Chief Ministers such as Marshall Perron keep trying to pre-empt the Government's response, a consultative response which is being embarked upon throughout Australia. </PARA>

That is a good thing. The outcome may be protracted, but in the interests of reconciliation legal status is a good thing for this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, may I add my congratulations to you on your new role in the chair. I want to take only a few minutes to support the matters mentioned by my colleague Senator Baden Teague in presenting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill on behalf of the Liberal and National parties. As he said, we generally support the thrust of the legislation and, with the one exception of the appointment of three commissioners, we propose to leave the situation much as it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to hear that Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats will be supporting us. I would never have accused Senator Kernot of having a paternalistic or maternalistic attitude towards Aborigines. As my colleague said, we support the legislation because it principally takes into account the policy and position the Liberal and National parties took into the last election for ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. That policy was prepared and formulated principally by the then shadow Minister, now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Dr Michael Wooldridge, who spent a great number of months consulting with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A green paper was issued and distributed widely and there was a lot of comment on it. Our policy was then formulated, taking into account the comments, suggestions and wishes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who looked at that green paper. So, for that reason, we generally support the legislation, with the one exception I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, we congratulate the Government for understanding what needed to be done in these circumstances and for having the courage, which it does not often show, to take up the Opposition's policies. I am sure the Government will take up many more of the Opposition's policies over the next three years, as well it should. The Government has got itself into an enormous mess in most areas of government responsibility. The only way the Government is likely to get out of it is by having a good look through the Opposition's packages presented at the last election and adopting some of those proposals, of course, with the exception of any new tax proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Labor Party got any mandate at all in the last election, it was a mandate not to introduce or increase taxes. It is the Government's own business how it gets around that, but we will be watching the Government very carefully. Apart from that, I urge the Government to continue what it has done in this Bill of adopting policies proposed and thoroughly researched by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the tasks that I hope the newly elected and appointed commissioners will look at seriously is the question of alcoholism in Aboriginal communities. I refer particularly to the problem that exists in the Cape York area. It is a terrible disease and I have the utmost criticism for the Queensland Government in regard to its attention to this problem. It is a problem that the Queensland Government does not seem to wish to properly address. I certainly hope the ATSIC will look seriously at the problem and see if there are ways of doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of alcohol to Aboriginal communities has meant that a once fine, proud and very caring race of people has become in part a very violent, irresponsible community. There are many stories brought to me by constituents of problems where the whole CDEP, or government assistance, cheque is spent in one night on alcohol. This means the women and children, the families, spend the next couple of weeks without any real form of sustenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a violence which results from alcoholism. It is an enormous problem for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It is a problem for everyone, but I am particularly speaking about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders at the moment. Some of the community councils have attempted to do something about it, but they have not got the sort of support that I would have expected from the Queensland Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While I am talking about the Queensland Government, could I mention that I think the current Minister, the Hon. Anne Warner, is an absolute and abject failure in her job as the Minister responsible for some of the problems in these areas. I wrote to Ms Warner on 2 March about a situation existing in the community of Bamaga. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bamaga is situated in the mainland Cape York area but it is a community comprised of people of Torres Strait Island origin. They have a very effective and efficient council operating there, under the chairmanship of Mr Waika Jawai, Mr Warnacka Adidi and Mr Ron Jawai. It is a very progressive community that is getting on and doing very substantial things for its people.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a shopping complex in Bamaga that last year made a net profit of something between $600,000 and $700,000 after wages, as I understand. It all comes out of the Bamaga community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I understand that the Queensland Government, or some other entity of the Queensland Government or someone else, takes all the profit that comes from the Bamaga community. It is apparently quite a profitable store but none of the money, or very little of the profit that is made, stays in that community. The community's only source of income is from the canteen and I think it is an atrocious situation where, for that community to exist and progress, it has to rely on the profit it makes from selling alcohol at its community canteen. The people have asked Ms Warner to transfer the shopping complex to them, so that they can use that $600,000 to $700,000 net profit for the benefit of their community. They have had no response from Ms Warner. I wrote to her on 2 March. At this time I have not even been favoured with an acknowledgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also raised with Ms Warner the matter of some houses that belong to the government, which are not occupied now, which the local community could well use. There is a housing shortage for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in that community but they are simply unable to get their hands on these government houses that are left vacant. I raised that with Ms Warner and again I have received no reply. I think it is an atrocious situation. On behalf of the Opposition I support the Bill. </PARA>

I therefore ask the Minister: why did he allow the Commonwealth to consent to orders being made by the Federal Court which, in the words of Gyles QC, `assumed the validity and effectiveness' of the tender process when he was by then acutely aware of these technical deficiencies?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the last part of the question is no. I reiterate what I said in the Senate yesterday: the closest I came to these technical deficiencies, as I told the Senate yesterday, was when there was a meeting in early February&mdash;the Senate will recall that early February was when the Federal election was being announced&mdash;at which a communication adviser on my staff was present. At that meeting there was a general understanding that there was some technical deficiency in the documents. That was never advised to me and, I might add&mdash;I am happy for the paper to be laid out&mdash;neither was there any reason for it to be, because the advice that was being sought, and the Senate will have it, was whether the Commonwealth had a strong case for getting the court to confirm the revocation.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was headlined as `More bad news for the Government', but it was nothing but good news for me because his understanding of the situation and his assumptions that were made as a result of the court order were precisely mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That early February meeting was as close as my office even got to it because it was considered, as a result of the advice that was received from the Attorney-General on 22 February&mdash;and honourable senators will see that advice&mdash;that the Commonwealth had a strong case for getting the revocation to be supported by the court. What was then intended, and that is why this was not seen as a problem at that time, was that all the instruments&mdash;the determination, the gazettal notice and the information paper&mdash;would then be reissued, thus correcting the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the court case was not resolved in the way that our advice suggested it would be, it was then also assumed by the legal advisers that the court taking over the process meant&mdash;I quoted from the court order yesterday, the one that Mr Stokes quoted this morning, and I quote it again&mdash;that the Commonwealth `should accept and treat as valid any tender or revised tender complying with a ministerial direction under which the tender process was conducted'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite Senator Macdonald's ignorance in this area, the matter has been addressed by a number of people on this side of the chamber&mdash;particularly by Senator Tate and myself before him when we held the portfolio of consumer affairs. Obtaining uniformity in this part of the law has been a long and difficult process. However, it has been made more necessary because of the changes that have occurred in the financial sector and in the usage of credit products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr is right: on 14 May SCOCAM&mdash;the Standing Committee of Consumer Affairs Ministers&mdash;finally reached agreement on uniform credit laws. One aspect of the agreement&mdash;credit card fees&mdash;has received a fair degree of publicity. The Government's view is that a move here will take away the last excuse the banks possess for maintaining their current unconscionably high level of interest rates on credit cards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a range of benefits agreed to last week which the Senate should know about. Uniform credit legislation will provide benefits by redressing situations where present credit laws are inconsistent&mdash;namely, the type of product covered; the monetary jurisdiction involved; the sorts of credit providers involved; the laws that presently apply; the degree of price control; and the degree of consumer protection. These inconsistencies make it impossible for consumers to find their way through the law. They also provide a massive hindrance to national micro-economic reform. We are talking about achieving uniformity, not only across States and Territories but also in the law's application to the bodies involved and to consumers, no matter what part of the market they are in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic features of this uniform law are to protect consumers by truth in lending provisions and to ensure that the provisions apply to all credit providers. The main features talk about pre-contractual disclosure of all fees and charges, the provision of regular statements, adequate notice, capacity to renegotiate contracts in times of hardship, capacity to open a contract in situations where there are unfair provisions, capped civil penalties and proper disclosure. These are all basic and important protections for consumers&mdash;protections which to date consumers have not had in a whole range of credit transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth welcomes this agreement&mdash;we were very much a part of obtaining it. We also feel there is a need to add to it. We will seek funding in the Budget context for a consumer information centre to provide comparative information on financial products. We will also ask the Prices Surveillance Authority to monitor credit card pricing for three years, and for a full inquiry during that three year term into pricing practices. Amongst the inquiry's terms of reference will be a provision to make recommendations in respect of future monitoring needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important agreement that will be progressed by legislation in the near future. Legislation prepared by Senator Tate in June or July 1992 will be revised in view of the decisions taken last week. By 1 August 1993 State governments also will take measures concerning credit card fees. The agreement last week will lead to legislation which will apply in all the States, with some minor deviation as to technical detail in Western Australia. It is legislation which has been long in coming but which is necessary for the marketplace.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is, yes, we are, and we are being heavily lobbied to change the scheme. That is hardly new news. From time to time there has been continual lobbying to abandon the scheme because it is expensive in providing that freight equalisation.

The fact of the matter is that nothing I said should underestimate the fact that there is a substantial number of Australians&mdash;some as a result of the significant recession through which we have just come, others for all sorts of other reasons to do with personal difficulties that would have arisen irrespective of economic circumstances, and others for reasons of structural change in the economy&mdash;facing serious economic difficulty.

There is a substantial amount of evidence to indicate that the distribution policies that are already in place are substantially redistributing income in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give just one example. Last year the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a publication on the results of a study on the effects of government benefits and taxes on the distribution of income amongst private Australian households in the fiscal year 1988-89. After taking account of the tax transfer system, the income share of the 20 per cent of households with the lowest incomes increased from 0.8 per cent to 7.6 per cent. This group paid 2.8 per cent of all taxes and received 24.7 per cent of total benefits. That is not something one can extend indefinitely and say, `Therefore, if we had 100 per cent of the income being redistributed everybody would be better off'. The laws of arithmetic do not allow that. But it does say that there is a substantial amount of redistribution going on at the moment.</PARA>

The social security system is, with the tax system, undertaking a fundamental redistribution. For so long as we have a progressive taxation system and a strong social welfare system that will continue to be the case. But that is not a basis for complacency, for saying that therefore nothing more needs to be done. Nobody that I am aware of is saying that. I certainly am not. I am simply asserting that the facts make it clear that a combination of a progressive tax system&mdash;that is, rejecting regressive tax options&mdash;and significant welfare initiatives, for example, the family allowance supplement, combine to be significantly redistributive.

I also refer to the fact that independent forecasters are predicting that a `no change policy' would produce a deficit in 1996-97 of more like $12 billion to $13 billion or $8 billion higher than the Government's stated target. Would this not mean that taxes will either have to rise by $8 billion or the personal income tax cuts be cancelled and/or a massive program of expenditure cuts initiated? Is it a fact that the Government has ruled out major expenditure cuts? If so, will the Government raise taxes by the $8 billion required to meet its undertaking or cancel the promised personal income tax cuts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is committed to restoring the Budget deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. As the economy moves back into stronger growth, we believe that target will be achievable. However, achieving it will require a medium term fiscal strategy. It will be a primary object of the 1993-94 Budget to outline that strategy and I am not proposing now or at any time between now and then to anticipate that particular process or comment on the particular elements in the strategy, whether on the revenue or on the outlay side. That is the job for the Treasurer, that is the job for Budget night, and Senator Short and everybody else will just have to curb their racing hormones and wait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That strategy will set out how we intend to achieve our deficit target and, more importantly, I guess, how we propose to contribute to the increased national savings that will be required to finance higher investment that will in turn be necessary to ensure a sustained recovery and a reduction in unemployment. As to the 1993-94 deficit, it is our intention to keep that to around the 1992-93 level, and beyond that I do not propose to comment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly have no intention of being stampeded&mdash;whether by comment in this place or anywhere else&mdash;into taking any measure to threaten the economic recovery which, at this stage, is still manifestly proceeding at a somewhat modest pace. A savage cut in the deficit would be quite inappropriate against that background, with that approach in mind for 1993-94, but I can assure Senator Short&mdash;and again anyone else who is interested&mdash;that a determined start will be made to ensuring that the public sector is not detracting from national savings in the medium term.

If we were to use both articles 12 and 19 of the GATT, if we were to succumb to Senator Spindler's blandishment, those articles would require us to consult with our trading partners so that those trading partners could agree that the balance of payments was in a parlous state such that would justify us making that application and would require us to obtain approval from the IMF as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

The most significant step that this Government will take to improve the competitiveness of Australian industry in the very near future is to press ahead with its tax cuts for company taxation, reducing the tax from 39c in the dollar to 33c in the dollar. If one takes those cuts, together with reductions in the depreciation allowance that we have made, in Australia we now have a corporate tax regime which is below that of many ASEAN economies and competitive with the lowest taxed economies in the ASEAN area.</PARA></TALK.START>

Australia's record of exports of manufactured goods and sophisticated services, particularly to this region, has been outstanding and the diversification of our export mix under this Government is one of the achievements of record.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston this day, relating to the tender process for subscription television licences.</PARA>
<PARA>This morning there are three editorials in three different newspapers which are of some interest, particularly as they precede the latest charade in Question Time today. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper of today&mdash;stating the blindingly obvious, I would have thought&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a bad couple of weeks for the federal Communications Minister, Senator Collins. In fact they have been so bad that he is unlikely ever to recover politically . . . The Government's handling of pay-TV has been appalling for quite some time, but it has now become farcical . . . And if ministerial responsibility has any real meaning, Senator Collins ought to go.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> has a very good quotation, given that Senator Collins seems to be pulling quotations out of everywhere, except those that have direct relevance to his personal responsibility. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Winston Churchill was attacked over the fall of Singapore, he said, "I didn't know. I was not told. I should have asked". This is one of the few quotations which Bob Collins, Minister for Transport and Communications, has not quoted in recent weeks, but as the debacle over pay television and an appalling performance over tenders continues, it might prove the one which was most apt. Yesterday, Senator Collins accepted the proposition that a minister should accept responsibility for poor administration when it could be demonstrated that there had been a continuing and a systemic problem the minister had done nothing about.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problems, moreover, have gone well beyond technical slips over legal intricacies.</PARA>
<PARA>Or, I might add, arcane issues. That is the latest buzz word for deflecting responsibility. No-one is suggesting for a moment that someone of the level of intelligence of Senator Collins ought to have been able to detect all the subtleties of that legal proposition. But what one ought to expect of even a Minister of average intelligence is that that Minister takes advice, asks what the implications of a proposition are, and actually understands something before signing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the criminal offence in this matter, and it has been compounded time and again. All we ever get from the Minister is, `How should I have known&mdash;no-one told me'. As Winston Churchill said, the answer is quite clear: the Minister should have asked. That is why the Minister, in his own words, is on the block. I would have thought that if ever there was a blockhead, then we are confronted with him as a result of today's performance in Question Time. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS> has a good turn of phrase in one of its articles. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Bob Collins, should resign. And if he does not take this honourable course in the light of the appalling mismanagement of pay TV policy, the Prime Minister should sack him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For weeks, Senator Collins has somehow managed to survive in this absurd political soap opera when any self-respecting script-writer would have killed off the villain.</PARA>

But who did, and who was proud of it? I would not bother.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to announce today that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas appeals.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Crowley, in answer to Senator West, said last week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the Government agreed to match dollar for dollar all dollars raised in the Christmas appeals of the major welfare organisations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was that the goalposts were shifted. The Government said afterwards, `Oh, we didn't really mean all the dollars raised. We meant the dollars that you spent in a particular period, and you need to spend it in this time'. That time was before the Federal election. The charitable organisations have their Christmas appeals and maybe a mid-year appeal and use the money from their Christmas appeals to go across that extended period over winter. They then have a winter appeal, which extends them through to Christmas. All that money raised would have to be spent if they were to get a dollar for every dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did the Government deceive the charitable organisations but it also deceived the donors. Many donors would say, `Rather than have the Government determine where my money is to go, I can make a donation to this organisation, I can get a tax deduction for it and I can get the Government to match it, so I can control in some ways where the money is going'. They were deceived when they gave their money. Now what will happen to these organisations? If we look at their pattern of receipts of gifts, we will see that they will taper off and there will not have been any significant increase in the annual amount of money given. They will have given money to be spent by those organisations before the Federal election. </PARA>

It has duped organisations such as the Brotherhood of Saint Laurence, the Salvation Army and the Smith Family and it has duped the donors of Australia and the people who receive help from those organisations.

I had hoped that Senator Crowley would prove me wrong by showing us that using the disadvantaged, those people in real crisis, was not just an election trick, that it was a genuinely compassionate move, and assuring us that similar moneys will be committed by the Government this time around.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Jones this day, relating to the Open Learning program at Monash University.</PARA>
<PARA>I rise to speak to what the Minister for Defence told the Senate today about the open learning initiatives at Monash University. It saddens me a little to do this because only yesterday Senator Ray complimented one of my speeches. I can really only put down what he has done to the fact that he was reading from a brief. As a matter of fact, it was not until he got up to a certain point in the brief that he realised he could challenge my interjections from the notes in front of him. The notes in front of him do not really accord with the facts as they stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are discussing an initiative of this Government at Monash University to provide more places in higher education through open learning. Let me tell the Senate the true story with regard to this initiative. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 10 March stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Open Learning Agency, the distance education system controlled by Monash University, has begun the academic year with 3000 enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is well below last year's estimates of 8000 to 14,000 for the 1993 academic year . . . Distance education specialists watching the progress of the Open Learning Agency are surprised by these numbers and say a recent estimate put existing enrolments around 2000. They say that even with 3000 enrolments, the agency will make budget for first semester&mdash;but only just.</PARA>
<PARA>It is claimed that this might even be overly optimistic. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in last year's trial open learning program, enrolments peaked in March. One observer suggests Monash should be very pleased with anything over 4000 enrolments for the full year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some distance education watchers put the slow start down to an inflexible structure. "Open learning is over-engineered, it is just not very open now" . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Let me make some comments about what the Government is trying to do here. In this country each year 50,000 students are turned away from universities and 140,000 students are turned away from TAFE colleges. After 10 years in government, this is the best the Labor Party can do for higher education. The Government realised that with its inappropriate structures and programs it was not going to be able to bridge this gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that during the last election the coalition put forward the correct programs and structures to free up the system and to allow the universities greater control over the enrolment process. But the Government has failed to adopt these policies; it has continued with a very centralised regime. This program on open learning is yet another example of that sort of centralisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's initiative at Monash is an overengineered and overcontrolled system. This system threatens the excellent distance education provision system that already exists in this country. The 10 distance education centres that exist in various States of Australia have an excellent record. This Monash system which the Minister was trumpeting today is the wrong way to go. We should free up open learning and allow universities to develop programs according to their own mission statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government wants to put open learning mainly in the hands of one university. Its initiative has been an abject failure, as shown by the enrolment system figures that I have just cited. I do not know where the Minister got his figures from, but I do not believe he got them from a credible source. I have cited these figures today to set the record straight and to show the failure of government policy in this area and the need for change. </PARA>

<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities&mdash;March 1993</EMPHASIS>, prepared by the Department of Finance, is a further revision of a series of guidelines first issued a decade ago, in May 1983, which commenced a period of very worthwhile development of the financial statements and procedures of the Commonwealth. I give credit to the Department of Finance and to the Government for the way in which they have advanced the cause of financial statements over the last few years. There is still a long way to go, but there certainly have been some worthwhile improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular document, the first of three being presented today, contains guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities. The other documents deal with financial statement guidelines for departmental secretaries and I will have a few words to say about those at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of these guidelines is to facilitate the preparation of general purpose financial reports of public authorities and commercial activities that convey relevant and reliable information to users, and enable managers to</PARA>
<PARA>discharge their accountability responsibility in an effective manner. The disclosure requirements set out in the guidelines are minimum standards, so it says in the introduction, and do not limit the disclosure of other relevant information in the notes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document is essentially a technical document and, therefore, I will not attempt to traverse it in these brief comments. There are just two aspects that I want to draw attention to. The first one is paragraph 39 which, under the subheading of `Methods of valuing assets', points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July 1991 the Special Premiers' Conference agreed that a framework for national performance monitoring should be established for Government Trading Enterprises (GTEs). As part of this process a Commonwealth-State committee was convened to prepare consistent guidelines for valuation of assets of GTEs for all jurisdictions. In February 1993, the Committee's draft report was sent to GTEs and public authorities for comment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important development because one of the difficulties we have had in measuring performance, in determining accountability and in obtaining financial comparisons in Australia between the States and between the various public authorities and commercial activities has been a lack of uniformity in their accounting standards and the guidelines for financial reporting. That movement in the 1991 Premiers Conference for the development of a framework for national performance monitoring is an important development and I think we should all watch its further development with interest. Certainly I will be doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this document that I will comment on briefly is the paragraphs under the subheading `Annual reports'. It is pointed out that there is a responsibility for financial statements to be included in annual reports of the public authorities, and that these should be furnished to responsible Ministers as soon as possible at the end of each financial year. The report also states that, if possible, they should be furnished in time for the estimates debate in the Budget sittings; and that it is certainly important for them to be furnished in sufficient time to be tabled in parliament before it rises. That is a matter that has been of some concern, I know, to many senators. Not always are those timetables, particularly in relation to the estimates hearings, adhered to. It is a matter to which I hope close attention will be paid. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial statement guidelines for departmental secretaries&mdash;(accrual reporting)</EMPHASIS> is the most important of the three Department of Finance guidelines documents being presented to the Senate today. This is a new document and a new concept, whereas the other two documents are revisions of earlier guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document follows an announcement on 4 December 1992 by the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) that Commonwealth departments are to move to financial reporting on an accrual basis as the next step in the Government's public sector reform program. This is the first document to come forward as a result of that announcement. As the document says, these guidelines prescribe reporting requirements for Commonwealth departments that have elected to prepare financial statements on an accrual basis for the year ending 30 June 1993. The document says that that election should be evidenced in the accounting policy note. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, this is the first step along a process that will eventually become mandatory for Commonwealth departments to account on an accrual rather than a cash basis. In that sense it is breaking new ground. It is long overdue. The Opposition has long argued that accrual accounting should be the essential component of financial accounting for the Commonwealth, despite there being some traps along the way. It is not a simple concept at all but, unless one has accrual accounting and reporting on an accrual basis, it is impossible to know from looking at the financial statements of government departments precisely what their financial position is. Cash accounting and reporting on a cash basis is insufficient in that sense, despite its being important in its own right for appropriation purposes while we still have the annual appropriation procedures that prevail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those departments that have not yet elected to go onto the accrual reporting basis are dealt with in the next document to be discussed, and I will make a couple of comments on that. In the meantime, I commend this particular document to the Senate. It deserves our careful consideration. It is a very worthwhile development and I commend the Department of Finance on its work in this area. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

It was first issued in June 1989 and this is its fifth revision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this document and its guidelines apply to the financial statements of departments which have not yet elected to prepare their financial statements in accordance with the previous document we spoke about, namely, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial statement guidelines for departmental secretaries (accrual reporting)</EMPHASIS>. It is intended that these guidelines for modified cash reporting, as distinct from accrual reporting, shall apply for the year ending 30 June 1993&mdash;one month's time&mdash;and that they shall remain in force until the accrual reporting guidelines become mandatory for all departments. So, in that sense, this third document, the modified cash reporting guidelines, is a holding document for the transition period to the move to full accrual reporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore a technical document. I will not comment any further on it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before us basically falls into two very easily defined parts. The first is the portfolio restructuring, or the reorganisation, of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. That is achieved through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill that we are considering. The second aspect deals with issues relating specifically to land administration for Aboriginal people. That is achieved through the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill that is also before us.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will constrain my remarks into two very discrete and distinct sections in order to address those issues, namely, the Commission reorganisation and land administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned in the Senate estimates committees last week, ATSIC can stand proud and tall for the record of achievement in the few years since it came into existence. It came into existence after a very rough passage in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, and a great deal of criticism of the Government's handling of its financial administration in that particular area. The legislation setting it up had a very difficult and tortuous passage through this Parliament. Nevertheless, I am pleased to say that the work of the commissioners and the senior staff&mdash;probably not least the evolving role of the regional councillors throughout Australia&mdash;has meant that the transition is one on which so many people can now look back and say it has been a job well done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased that this legislation picks up many of the tenets of the Liberal National party coalition policies that were announced prior to the last election. Those of us in the Liberal and National parties had spent some time reviewing the early formation of ATSIC and were pleased to develop policies that we believe reflected the views and aspirations of Aboriginal people; yet at the same time we could accept that it was a time for review of some of the administrative structures and forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably quite correct to say that there has been a burgeoning of administrative costs within ATSIC and that would cause some concern. The objective of this legislation is to ensure that that does not continue. I would liken the ATSIC record to the evolving role of local government in Australia. I hope that the lessons and the examples that many Aboriginal people receive through their participation in the zones, regions and commissions of ATSIC will enable them to move on and take full and proper roles in municipal and local government administration throughout Australia in the communities in which they live. I believe there will be many lessons to be learnt through the structures within ATSIC itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be treated with a certain degree of controversy. I noted in yesterday's Alice Springs newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Centralian Advocate</EMPHASIS>, that there was quite a degree of what I would call political controversy among Aboriginal people in that community on tenets of this particular legislation. The central Australian ATSIC commissioner, Mr Geoff Shaw, is under attack because of communication problems in that particular area. In particular, I note the comments where he has had to justify certain action by his fellow commissioners. The local regional councils in that area have taken Mr Shaw on and said that they, in turn, do not like some of the considerations that are being put together and the structures that are being proposed even in this legislation. There is obviously a problem of communication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the constituent organisations in my electorate has recently written to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). A letter from Andrew Thomas, Chairman of the Impiyara Regional Council, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have today been advised by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner, that he has directed that changes be made to the structure of the ATSIC. These changes include a significant alteration to ATSIC Regional Councils and existing boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Impiyara Regional Council has not been consulted upon the proposed changes and will be significantly disadvantaged if they proceed. We call upon you to direct your Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to re-assess this proposal and consult with all Regional Councils before proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will not accept the imposition of a new ATSIC structure which has been created by white bureaucrats in Canberra for the convenience of white bureaucrats in Canberra. We were told that ATSIC was established to operate under the control of Aboriginal people, but what ATSIC has become in three short years of operation is a Commission controlled by non-Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have just begun to get ATSIC working for us and now your labor government is proposing to take it away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not accept Mr Tickner's proposals and request your intervention in this matter immediately:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Andrew Thomas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter is indicative of the frustration in the normal political process that we all face in many organisations. I would hope that it does not seriously reflect a problem of communication with Aboriginal regional organisations or communities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal constituency in Australia is small&mdash;some 250,000 people throughout Australia in a country of 17 million. When we look at the myriad Aboriginal organisations that feed into, receive grants from, and are part of the funded network of ATSIC, it is very important to recognise that there is almost a council and organisation for each Aboriginal family, clan, or kin group throughout Australia in one way or another. We have to guard against the influence of nepotism in such an organisation and the way in which it would be structured. Therefore, it is important that the accountability structures are totally underpinned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would again commend the work of ATSIC's Office of Evaluation and Audit, and the structures that it has been able to put in place since the problems of the 1988-89 period. The reports of the Auditor-General, because of the size of funding attributed to this portfolio, constantly bring us back to looking at it. The coalition amendment that will be considered here today, in looking at the accountability of the commission itself, still recognises that very important tenet. I am pleased the Democrats have indicated that they will be supporting that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we compare ATSIC with other Aboriginal organisations, it is important to see how they stand out with credit against groups such as the Northern Land Council that I criticised very severely in the Senate estimates last week. I note that I have not yet received any answers to a large number of questions that I posed at that time, and therefore in the appropriation debates in the next week I am going to have to push and pull the Government a lot further in that area in the interests of my Aboriginal constituency. Whether those are questions of funding generally, the use of consultants or fringe benefits, tax rorts, or other structures, they are what we would do in any organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Restructuring is also important when looking at the changed relationships between State and Territory governments and Aboriginal organisations. Honourable senators would know that late last year the Northern Territory Government, with which I am very familiar, created a special Ministry of Aboriginal Development. In a press release dated 13 May, the Minister, Mr Steve Hatton, announced a number of very important portfolio restructuring initiatives to develop a better relationship between the Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal people. Special attention was given to bilateral agreements with ATSIC, to conferences with land councils, and to an accelerated process for the settlement of land claims. A number of other State governments are also entering into direct and important relationships. These are important developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most important matter that we need to address today in the area of Aboriginal advancement&mdash;the improvement in their lifestyle and sense of worth&mdash;is the participation of Aborigines in private sector employment. For far too long there has been too great a dependence by Aboriginal people on funds from the government nipple. The real indicator of reconciliation will be the increasing involvement of Aboriginal people in direct private sector employment rather than dependence on CDEP programs, employment by government and semi-government organisations, or voluntary organisations that depend on government funding. The true measure of the results of independence will be when we see Aboriginal people participating in employment in the same proportion as the general community. I certainly commend those aspects of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill which reach out towards that goal and which reflect the aspirations and the progress of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the area of land administration, and the amendments to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. This arises particularly from the initiatives taken with regard to what is called the Catfish Dreaming and Eva Valley scheduling of land within the land rights Act. That schedule created very special tenure for Aboriginal people. The Mount Todd agreement resulted from negotiations between the Northern Territory Government, the traditional owners and the mining company through which all parties were able to access each other directly and develop mutual trust. The Commonwealth facilitated the process through the support and assistance of the Office of Northern Development. Although the Northern Land Council was required to perform statutory functions pursuant to the Act, it did not represent the Jawoyn people in the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this agreement, the scheduling of these areas of land was requested by the Northern Territory Government. Catfish Dreaming is a small area of land adjacent to the township area and is likely to be used as a community living area. The Jawoyn people intend to subdivide the Eva Valley pastoral lease, incorporating the western portion into Nitmiluk National Park, commonly known as Katherine Gorge. This park is Aboriginal land, managed by a board with a majority Jawoyn membership through a lease back arrangement with the Northern Territory Conservation Commission&mdash;a State functional body connected with national park management. The Nitmiluk National Park is the most innovative joint management arrangement in the country. The Northern Territory will add a further portion of land to the park, thereby more than doubling its size. The Jawoyn people, as part of the agreement, will receive&mdash;and I stress&mdash;Northern Territory  freehold title to approximately 1,800 square kilometres of land containing the Mount Todd gold project and several other highly prospective exploration licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also scheduled in this legislation is the Kanturrpa-Kanttaji claim area where the Northern Territory Government again opened negotiations which led to agreement on this claim, a repeat claim over the area not recommended for a grant in the Warumungu land claim. Very importantly, this agreement facilitates the supply of water services in the township of Tennant Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look carefully at these mining and community based projects, it is important that we recognise that this legislation, which facilitates certain action, must not be seen in any way as a precedent for something that today is referred to as the Mabo decision. It is very important that these special arrangements stand on their own merit and should not be used as a bribe or as a blackmail example that would be seen as not acting in the interests of Aboriginal people. All around Australia people are saying that this or that may not be a claim under native title such as Mabo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently in Alice Springs Aboriginal people wanted to claim land that had been set aside for an orchard, and the Central Land Council had to deny that it ever intended to test the native titles area. A $3 million development project has failed because of the threat. This is a facilitating piece of legislation and it must not be seen as a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague in the other place, the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Nugent, made it clear that the coalition did not see it as a precedent. The Northern Territory Minister for Aboriginal Development, Mr Hatton, has said that his government does not consider that any precedents have been established with respect to the Mabo decision. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This negotiation was about settling outstanding land claims, facilitating the commencement of a gold mine and creating a situation whereby the Jawoyn people can continue their pursuit of economic selfsufficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>Mabo is a new title of land in Australia created last year by the High Court. It is controversial in its implementation and its settlement, and it is going to require very careful consideration by all interested parties throughout Australia in order not to set black and white people against each other. There are implications for industry; there are implications for Aboriginal people. State governments in particular are going to have to address this issue very delicately. Yesterday the Northern Territory Parliament passed the Confirmation of Titles to Land (Request) Act. The Chief Minister's press release said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation calls on the Federal Government to secure existing titles in the Northern Territory following the Mabo High Court decision. He said what the Act endeavoured to attain was security for the thousands of titles issued since the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975 whether they had been issued as pastoral leases, mining leases, freehold land, or under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. He said that the High Court decision had cast doubt on the validity of those titles because there may have been people who would claim native title using the principles established by Mabo. Mr Perron said the Act contained the form of legislation that the Federal Parliament should enact to secure existing titles for all Territorians.</PARA>
<PARA>By its very tenor and nature, that legislation will be passed to this Parliament for action. It is very important. In considering the legislation before us here today it is important that both of these Bills secure the support of all parties in this Parliament. I am pleased to note the support that the Australian Democrats have given to the coalition's amendment. The provisions relating to ATSIC should not be seen as an insult or a putting down of the increased aspirations of Aboriginal people. There are very important principles involved, and I think as part of the entire process this legislation is very much striking new ground. </PARA>

The basic thrust of the legislation is to reduce the number of full-time commissioners and full-time regional councillors. The 1989 Act which established 60 regions and 60 commissioners has now been reduced to 36 regional councils and 17 full-time commissioners elected by the regional councils. All commissioners and regional council chairmen will be full time, which will lead to far more effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my travels through the Aboriginal communities of the central desert of Western Australia&mdash;starting in Leonora, Laverton, Warburton, Wingelinna, Blackstone, Warakurna, Wiluna, Kalumburu, Turkey Creek, Christmas Creek and a few others that I do not remember&mdash;a commissioner from Kununurra impressed on me the efficiency the commissioners would have if they were employed on a full-time basis, even though there may be less of them. This particular gentleman in Kununurra told me of the amount of his own time he spends travelling to Canberra, Perth or Darwin. I welcome the Government's move to employ full-time commissioners and a full-time chairman, which will lead to more efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standards of the communities that I have visited over the years are mostly improving. That improvement can be seen when visiting the areas. I make special mention of Warburton, Turkey Creek, Warakurna, Wingelinna and Blackstone in Western Australia. I cannot say the same about the others. Unfortunately, some of them seem to be going backwards. I do not know whether the problem lies with the council, the commissioners or their advisers. I believe that Kalumburu has a long way to go and that that community should be looked at sooner rather than later with a view to improving those standards. The first time I visited Warburton, which was a long time prior to coming to this place, I thought it was hell on earth. I saw only one other place where I thought the Aborigines suffered badly, and that was at Oodnadatta in South Australia. I have not visited that place since, but visitors to Warburton will really see a big improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of merit in this legislation is the mechanism whereby a ward system may be introduced at a later date. I would rather see that introduced earlier than later, because some minorities that tend to be pushed aside in such regional council areas may then get a fair hearing and a fair go when it comes to resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this particularly because there is an unresolved dispute in the Kalgoorlie region, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) admitted this in answer to a question on notice some time back. This dispute is between the Wongi people and the Gubbrun people. The Gubbrun people are a minority group in that area, mainly made up of the Champion family, the Sambo family and I think the Donaldson family is the third one. Over the past three or four years they have been continually in contact with my office to complain about the treatment they get at the hands of the regional council. I have made various approaches to the Minister and asked questions in the estimates committee, but the problem goes on and on. I know that these three families are, to pardon the pun, champion people. I have known the Champion family all my life, and I have also known the Sambo family virtually all my life. Their cry for help or for a fair go seems to be falling on deaf ears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the idea of a council representing a particular ward is a good one. I had a reasonable career in local government before I came to this place, and I found that local governments that did away with wards certainly fell down in their overall representation. Therefore, I certainly agree with that part of the legislation and would like to see it introduced as soon as possible so that those minority groups can be looked after. </PARA>

It concerns the Strelley communities in Western Australia, five Pilbara cattle stations near Port Hedland. The chief executive officer of ATSIC, Dr Shergold, is reported as saying that the commission's Port Hedland regional council was concerned about the continuing viability of the communities and had decided to suspend funding for them. I would like to know what has happened to the funding for the last two years. I quote from a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 18 May:</PARA>

If these stations are abandoned&mdash;and the report says that only two Europeans are living there&mdash;then I would like to know where the money has gone.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reply to the concerns of Mr Minson, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia, my good friend Ernie Bridge, whom I have had quite a bit to do with over the years, has said that the stations have been destocked for BTEC. But the BTEC program has almost finished in Western Australia&mdash;in fact, it has almost finished in Australia. To my knowledge it goes back to about 1986. There was destocking then, and then restocking. I always respect what Mr Bridge says, but I think he has got the bull by the tail in this case&mdash;pardon the pun&mdash;and that the stocking should have been there. They are the questions that I ask, to find out what happened to that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vice-chairman of the Conservation Council of WA, Peter Robertson, jumped on the bandwagon when questions were asked and criticised the probing&mdash;which even came from the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Western Australia&mdash;into why these stations were abandoned. He branded people asking questions or seeking an inquiry into the matter as being sensationalist. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is mind-boggling that a small handful of Aboriginal leaseholders should be hounded for alleged mismanagement when mismanagement underlies the entire industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Nobody has alleged that a small handful of Aboriginal leaseholders are guilty of mismanagement. What people are asking is: if those two stations were abandoned for two years, where did that money go? Many people will ask questions and many answers will need to be forthcoming. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I am moved to comment on the matters raised by Senator Panizza. If this legislation does no more than guarantee greater accountability and scrutiny in the expenditure of taxpayers' money in the interests of the wellbeing and welfare of the Aboriginal community, it will be commendable legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza raised the matter of stations in the north of Western Australia such as Coongan, Strelley, Lalla Rookh, Warralong and Callawa. Most of those stations&mdash;particularly, Coongan, Strelley and Warralong&mdash;are on river country that runs along the Coongan and DeGrey rivers. It is beautiful country. In better economic times, those stations have been excellent and particularly productive. But like many stations in the Pilbara and, to a lesser extent, the Kimberleys, they were bought by the Aboriginal community, presumably for the purpose of providing an economic base and an area where they could settle and which they could call their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that those stations were bought at an enormous price. Most of them have been thoroughly destocked. The homesteads, many of them majestic constructions of a past era, have been totally destroyed. The Aboriginal communities who moved on to them have simply moved off them and gone somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Panizza said, it is as though that part of the government outlays which goes towards Aboriginal groups is unique in one way: it has the distinction of being above and beyond the scrutiny of the Parliament, committees of the Parliament or government departments. Anybody who is so presumptuous as to inquire whether the funds are delivered to those for whom they are intended to be received and whether they fulfil the objectives and purposes for which they are dedicated promptly becomes an inquisitorial racist. That is the facade behind which white Australians who attach themselves to these causes and groups so often hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What enrages and appals me&mdash;and I am sure this is true for Senator Collins&mdash;is that, when one visits these Aboriginal stations, out-stations or communities, one sees an appalling waste of taxpayers' money, while at the same time the Aboriginal people continue to live in squalor and poverty with no prospects, no hopes and no likelihood of their standard of living being anything other than wretchedly poor and devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time I have raised specific matters in the Parliament, and all in vain. I have raised cases of white advisers, bookkeepers and managers who, in some cases, have simply stolen money and disappeared; I have raised cases of misappropriation of funds and cases of mismanagement. Without exception, the department and the Minister particularly have simply washed their hands and said, `Well, in this day and age of enlightened self-determination, that's not a matter for the Parliament, the Government or the department; that's really a matter for those who employ these people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred on one occasion to the Oombulgurri group, located just across the Cambridge Gulf from Wyndham, who spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a barge to ship cattle across the gulf. The barge did not ship a single beast. It was run up onto the shore where for two years two magnificent large diesel engines in its base were, of course, totally destroyed as they lay immersed in salt water. But when I pursued that matter, I was told that was really a determination or decision of the community and not one which impinged upon government policy or contemplation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the case of a Mr Peter Ross who has been&mdash;and I say this with no great credit to him necessarily&mdash;a long time Labor Party supporter in the Kimberley. He has been associated with a number of communities, including Marra Worra Worra, Wangkatjungka and, more recently, one or two others. He has been responsible for stealing money or misappropriating funds from the Aboriginal communities and using plant and equipment for purposes other than that for which it was dedicated. On each occasion I have been advised by the department that that is simply a matter of administration for the Aboriginal councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a long list of matters raised by the auditor. One trivial matter was that Mr Ross had purchased, using an Aboriginal community cheque, 34 cartons of beer. When he was questioned by the auditor on that matter, he said the beer was for entertaining visiting government employees. Either the Aboriginal affairs department of Western Australia is full of drunks or Mr Ross was telling lies. That is just a modest but typical example of the cavalier way in which these people use taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the case of the power station using maximum levels of diesoline not in summertime but during wintertime, which is, of course, when one does not have air-conditioners on. It was very obvious to the auditor that the fuel was not being used in the generating plant; it was either not being delivered in the first place or it was being misappropriated for another cause. In the process of all that, we discovered that the person being paid a large salary as an engineer at the plant in fact had not lived out there for a number of years but had lived in town, and that the schoolteacher was being paid to do the job as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time we raise these matters, we are told that it is really not a matter for the Parliament. There are countless cases which, in themselves, almost seem trivial because we have become used&mdash;almost immune&mdash;to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands and perhaps even millions of dollars disappearing down a big black hole at the discretion of white advisers to these Aboriginal communities. But if an aberration of $10,000 were found in the Department of the Senate, we know that there would be a royal commission and enormous implications for the officers in charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can get a copy of the audited statements of almost every single Aboriginal community north of the 26th parallel in Western Australia and find, without exception, that they are qualified simply because there are no appropriate, suitable or proper books kept by the people who are paid. I think it was the Oombulgurri community that lost a large amount of money, the bookkeeper disappeared, he was never prosecuted and, to my knowledge, it was never pursued in a vigorous way by the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties seems to be that we have what I might describe as the unfortunate circumstance whereby, because of historic factors, the Aboriginal counsellors are made up of fine Aboriginal leaders but who are illiterate and innumerate, and they have no proper way of scrutinising the conduct of the bookkeepers or the white advisers. Yet, when it is found through audits that the latter are conducting themselves in improper or illegal ways, the response from the Government has always been that they are employed by the council and not by the department and so nothing is to be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one occasion, through a freedom of information request, I sought the audited statements of a number of communities and the department insisted on charging me for those statements. When I claimed a refund, I was told that it was not in the public domain, it was not a matter of public interest, and, therefore, I should not be refunded. Senator Tate saw the nonsense of that and ultimately the request was made in an appropriate way, and a suitable refund was obtained. But that seems to be the siege mentality that goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could spend a little time, but one will not, on the matters of Strelley station. For instance, Senator Panizza raised the issue that the generating plant had been generating electricity for the houses and street lighting for 18 months after the place was abandoned. There might be some quaint notion attached to that, but it thoroughly escapes me. On Strelley station, if I remember rightly, there is a million-dollar school that has never had a child inside it and it is now abandoned. That was paid for by one of the churches which, in many respects, seem to have about as little accountability as do government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that while these Aboriginal communities continue to live in appalling circumstances, the very funding which is intended to be directed towards providing the delivery of services to them, and lifting standards and improving their prospects of health, education and wellbeing, is being dissipated in the most obscene way. Each time the matter is debated in this Parliament, it is set aside as though it is immune to criticism or analysis. I hope that this legislation may in some vague and obscure way impose greater discipline or scrutiny on the process of the outlays of funds through ATSIC. </PARA>

At the time I had 80 per cent of the vote in that seat I was approached by a close Aboriginal friend of mine, Wesley Lanhupuy, who is an outstanding Aboriginal bloke and then the town clerk of Galiwinku, who indicated to me that he wanted to stand for parliament. The only seat he could have won was the one I held. I moved out of that seat and Wesley Lanhupuy is now in his third successive term as a member of parliament in the Northern Territory. </PARA>

The reason I am telling that story is so that Senator Kernot will understand the strong views I have about this amendment.

That is why I say this is not a small thing for me&mdash;it is a big thing. I think it is very sad indeed that the opportunity for ATSIC to do that is being blocked this afternoon by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to express my strong personal objections to this. Senator Kernot knows that I have held this view for a long time. I expressed it in the ATSIC Committee, and I conceded that whilst it was in its teething stages perhaps we should have this transitory arrangement of a government-appointed Chair. Senator Kernot knows, and I concede, that Aboriginal people, whom I respect enormously&mdash;they are great Australians in fact&mdash;actually support this foreshadowed amendment and want it carried. But I have to state the obvious. I am not talking about them; I am talking about us. I am a member of the Australian Labor Party, Senator Kernot is also a member of a political organisation, the Australian Democrats, and this amendment is being moved by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the greatest respect to Senator Kernot, I commend to the reading of anyone the speech delivered by Clyde Holding in the House of Representatives on this issue. I did not read it until just a minute ago&mdash;I will quote from it in a minute&mdash;and I agree with everything Clyde Holding said, not surprisingly, because he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs when the formative stages of this organisation were put together in his office. On its worst day ATSIC, with all of its commissioners in their most demented frame of mind, could not pick a bigger turkey to lead it than the coalition has succeeded in doing in re-electing John Hewson.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President: I defend the right of Senator Collins to be emotional about this. I do not believe he has a mortgage on sentiment about this debate, but to reduce the integrity of this debate by making odious comparisons and unpleasant reflections upon the Leader of the Opposition in my view adds nothing to the quality of this debate. It is unparliamentary and I ask that it be withdrawn.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw unreservedly. The point, though, is very valid, and Clyde Holding made it in the House of Representatives. I have to say&mdash;and I do not resile from it, and it is not unparliamentary to say it&mdash;that there are only three things in this life of which I am absolutely certain: the first is death; the second is taxes, and the third is that Dr John Hewson will not be the Leader of the coalition at the next Federal election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that aside, I make this valid point. We often know the deficiencies and defects of leaders. None of them can be perfect. I am sure, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Holding, said, that all coalition members would like John Hewson to have all of the qualities of Robert Menzies. If he has not, it is sad. No-one can be perfect. That is why I think ATSIC should have the right to choose its own leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What gives the Government the right, morally or in any other sense, to say that its judgment about who should be the symbolic leader, the spokesperson&mdash;and that is why this is so important&mdash;of an organisation which the Government, with the full support of this Parliament, has established to speak on behalf of Aboriginal people in Australia and to be the chief policy adviser to the Government on Aboriginal policy is the correct judgment? Considering the defects of our own organisation, our own Parliament, what gives us the right to say that we are in a position to make a better choice than the Aboriginal people themselves?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this amendment will be carried this afternoon, and I regret that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct, but there will be a review. I think that this amendment which, regrettably, will be passed by the Senate this afternoon will prevent the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission from choosing its own leader, its own chairperson, after three years. One of the useful options that could be explored during that review is the possibility at a future time of the chairperson of ATSIC not necessarily being chosen by the commissioners themselves&mdash;and I am not proposing this; I would simply like to see it explored as an option&mdash;but being a popularly elected chairperson from the body of electors who vote, or perhaps from the regional council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having dealt with that, I will conclude with one other matter. We are putting through some small but important matters in the land rights Bills that are before us this afternoon. They deal with the areas of Catfish Dreaming, Eva Valley Station and the area south-west of Tennant Creek. The reason this is significant is that the two areas to do with the area near Katherine are both there as a result of a successful negotiation between the operator of the Todd River Mine, Zapopan NL, the Northern Territory Government and the Aboriginal people in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that the agreement&mdash;and it is an excellent agreement; I commend people to read the details of it&mdash;provides very detailed descriptions of the jobs that will be available for Aboriginal people. It realistically lays out the training programs that will be implemented in order to ensure that people will be trained for those jobs. I also add that a realistic number of jobs&mdash;not ridiculous claims of 50 or 60&mdash;are identified in the agreement. It is a superb document indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The reason I make that point is that the document was put together with the assistance of the Commonwealth, in terms of the facilitation processes, through the role played by two officers of the Office of Northern Development based in Darwin, Mr Bill Gray and Mr Neil Westbury. I am sure that there are honourable senators here who would remember Bill Gray, because I know that he was highly respected on both sides of this chamber in his former roles as a long-time senior officer of the then welfare department and of DAA and then as the executive officer of ATSIC. Bill Gray and Neil Westbury played an extremely important role in facilitating this Todd River agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth. These same two officers are currently engaged in facilitating what I hope will be an equally successful agreement in respect of MacArthur River on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It simply shows what can be done. In a lot of ways the area near Tennant Creek is an even better example of an agreement. I think I mentioned that the Northern Territory Government was involved not only in that first agreement but also the second. This agreement was reached in order to secure the water supplies for the town of Tennant Creek. It was reached with the full agreement of the Aboriginal land owners and the Northern Territory Government in a successful negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I mention this is that there are a number of outstanding land claims that people are concerned about. In my view, the Northern Territory Government should follow its own example; that is, instead of wasting enormous sums of Northern Territory taxpayers' money&mdash;we cannot afford it&mdash;on fruitless legal actions in the High Court to try to prevent land claims, it could build on the example it has created near Tennant Creek and use the process that was used so successfully there in order to settle a lot of those outstanding land claims. I simply commend that suggestion to the Northern Territory Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude on the question of the Mabo decision. Again, I want to commend Clyde Holding's speech, particularly what he said about Mabo. I have heard a lot of discussion here this afternoon&mdash;which I have to say really gets right up my nose&mdash;about how Aboriginal people should not be using this decision as a precedent, a threat or a bribe. I am just astounded by that stuff. Of course, it would not occur to any citizen of Australia who was not black that beneficial use could be made of a court decision!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only reason for incorporating these draft amendments is that honourable senators can refer to the Opposition's original intention on this Bill. Let me pick up a couple of references the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Collins, made in his very sincere speech. He believes that the chairperson of ATSIC ought to be determined by the members of ATSIC. The Government proposes 17 commissioners and the Opposition proposes 19.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I readily admit that one of my first reactions to the steering committee's report on the reform of ATSIC&mdash;which I referred to in my speech in the second reading debate&mdash;was to contemplate the commissioners electing their own chairperson. It was on further consideration that I, along with my colleagues, came to the view that we ought to proceed by way of the amendments which I have now moved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place a great deal of weight on the principle that a responsible body, made up of elected representatives, should itself determine its chairperson and, indeed, its other officers. It will be observed that in this case, with what I believe will be the Senate amendment in place, we will still see a deputy chairperson elected in that fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then are the more compelling reasons that lead the Opposition at this point to move these amendments? I have referred to these matters in my speech in the second reading debate, but I summarise them in three references. Firstly, there is the reinforcement of accountability, given ATSIC's direct responsibility for public moneys&mdash;an amount towards $1 billion if not now certainly very soon&mdash;quite apart from its commercial activities which may also involve public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reinforcement of accountability is in line with the huge debate that took place in this Senate with regard to ATSIC's formation and with regard to certain specific accountability requirements that remain within the Act. I do not wish, in any way, to make light of the already existing accountability requirements for ATSIC, but that accountability will be reinforced by the Government, through the Minister, appointing the chairperson and by the Minister appointing two members of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is a greater flexibility for the determination of chairperson in the procedure that the Minister make such an appointment&mdash;such a choice. I urge the Minister of this Government and Ministers of future Liberal and National Party governments to consult carefully with the regions, the zones, the elected chairpersons and the commissioners, and to make a determination, taking into account not only the views of elected representatives through the ATSIC process, but also those of others holding positions of experience amongst the Aboriginal communities of Australia&mdash;and, indeed, wider than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot referred to advice that she received that, in the minds of the elected commissioners and the Minister, the best person who has the abilities, the sense of dialogue and representativeness, and the skill to chair this important council and ensure that it is a success, could already be holding some other position within Australia and could well accept the invitation of the Minister to be appointed to the chair of this important council. That avenue ought to be available; it gives that degree of flexibility. It is to be understood that the Minister's choice now can include, through the Opposition's amendment, any of the commissioners who are elected in the ATSIC process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point relates to the question of particular qualifications and the two commissioners appointed by the Minister. It may be that between them the 17 commissioners elected through the ATSIC process have every required skill&mdash;any degree of accounting knowledge and experience, legal knowledge and experience, or other areas of knowledge and experience&mdash;but not to the extent that the commissioners themselves may wish. To have a member of the commission with particular qualifications gives the Minister an opportunity to consider those factors and to consult widely before appointing the two members of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to Mabo and the reconciliation process. The Liberal and National parties believe it is of the highest priority and significance for all Australians, especially the Aboriginal people, that there be a sound and reasonable determination of the full implications of the Mabo decision; and that there be a sound and successful outcome of the reconciliation process, to which a number of us have referred during our speeches on this Bill. I do not take lightly the Mabo decision of the High Court, nor the reconciliation process to which we have variously referred during this debate. I commend the 10 amendments circulated by me on behalf of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very mindful of the fact that ATSIC has come into being following many raised expectations of indigenous Australians and many spectacular failures&mdash;not on their part, but on our part. We have not given them sufficient resources and we have put the concerns of indigenous Australians aside while we pursued other political agendas. I do not want to be part of anything which, however well-intentioned, sets up an opportunity for ATSIC to fail. I acknowledge that there will be an incredible amount of politics involved in the manoeuvring that is going to go on when a list of nominees for the appointed chairperson is put forward, but that is no different from manoeuvring to get into Prime Minister Keating's Cabinet; it is exactly the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have listened to many representations but they have not been exhaustive. I readily concede that as well. I expect that the next ATSIC elections will be very keenly fought because the activists who are opposed to the establishment of ATSIC now understand that, through the devolution of power to the regional councils, ATSIC does have real power over its budget. At the regional council level, indigenous Australians have the right to make important decisions as to their priorities for spending the funding that is available. We are arguing about the appointment of the chair; I would argue that the election of a regional councillor is very important as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to congratulate Lois O'Donoghue, a great Australian and a great chair of ATSIC&mdash;she is not supported by everyone in the Aboriginal community, and we would not expect her to be&mdash;and Mr Sol Bellear, the deputy chair of ATSIC. In their administration of ATSIC I have been able to observe a commendable command of detail and an absolute commitment to the principles of accountability, not just because we imposed them but because they believe in them. I have seen Lois O'Donoghue make some incredibly tough decisions which have made her very unpopular with particular Aboriginal communities around Australia. She is a strong and effective chair of ATSIC and she will be hard to replace; there is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating some of the remarks of Terry O'Shane because, again, they point to the way in which we assume so much about Aboriginal structures when we draft legislation. He said:</PARA>

That does not stand up to two seconds analysis for a number of very substantive reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has total control over the budget for ATSIC. Have a look at the legislation. The Minister can amend it, reject it&mdash;do whatever he likes with it. That is proper because we are dealing with public money. For as long as ATSIC exists, even if it exists for the next 50 years, I would not want to change that. Have a look at the legislation. The Minister has ultimate control over the budget in terms of accountability. In that sense, the chair is simply not relevant. </PARA>

I say here unblushingly that it is my view&mdash;and this has been the view of the board of ATSIC for a long time&mdash;that because of the amounts of public money involved, the Government should always have a role in the appointment of the chief executive officer. The positions of the chief executive officer and the Minister are totally separate, and Senator Kernot knows this from the symbolic importance of the chair. In respect of making decisions, the chair has no more strength on the board than any other member&mdash;one vote.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has a direct role in appointing the chief executive officer of ATSIC, and I think that is proper. It is an organisation which is supposed to be the Government's chief adviser on Aboriginal affairs and it has a national system of elections, at least at this stage, of being able to appoint its own leader. It is of symbolic importance&mdash;and symbols are important in this business. I have referred to this Clyde Holding speech before and I will only speak once in this debate. I am sure we all have that view, and this is it. I will quote a couple of paragraphs from what Mr Holding, a former Minister for Aboriginal affairs, said which I think sum it up very well because I agree with what he says. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt the sincerity of the shadow Minister but I say, on the basis of some considerable experience in this matter, that at the end of the day, if we are serious about reconciliation, it is essentially a white problem.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some 200 years Aboriginal people throughout the length and breadth of this great nation have been trying to reconcile themselves to living within the framework of a dominant white culture&mdash;a culture which in many ways they found brutally oppressive and foreign to the traditions, attitudes and religious beliefs that had governed them before our predecessors came to this land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, the shadow Minister should withdraw his amendment. For once, let the coalition say that it is prepared to take the same sorts of challenges as the Minister has accepted and accept the fact that although ATSIC is in many ways an imperfect instrument it is a major step forward. But it is no more an imperfect instrument than any of our own political parties. It is no more an imperfect political instrument than this Parliament itself. It seems to me to be an exercise of almost continuing patronage to say, `Yes, we think it is not a bad idea, but not now'. It is always for the coalition `not now'.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree. Speaking of an imperfect point: recently in the Federal Court case that has been alluded to, in which I gave evidence, counsel for the applicant made some very disparaging remarks about the defects of parliament. I restrained myself and bit my tongue&mdash;I was very well behaved in court&mdash;but it did occur to me to say in response to counsel for the applicant that perhaps one of the reasons for the defect of parliament is the very large number of lawyers that constitutes our membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to finish on a point in terms of ATSIC's capacity to teach us a few lessons. We are setting ourselves up with these amendments to say, `We're a better judge than ATSIC of its chair'. </PARA>

The reason it is important&mdash;and I am going to get into trouble for saying this&mdash;in my personal view, after 26 years of working with Aboriginal people, is that in contemporary Australia the backbone and the strength of Aboriginal society are the women.

An interesting point which I did not know until today is that 28 per cent of the total elected body of ATSIC are women. That is almost 30 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude with a point about the board&mdash;the one flaw in the argument. Senator Kernot has raised&mdash;and I say this with respect to her&mdash;the view of a number of Aboriginal people that this amendment should be supported because of their disagreement that ATSIC should elect its own chair at this time. I respect those views; they have been put to me, as Senator Kernot knows, by people I respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot has read out what a particular person thinks of the current proposal, but those comments&mdash;and I say this with respect, and I am not trying to antagonise the Opposition&mdash;would pale by comparison if they were stood alongside the views that someone such as Senator Bronwyn Bishop would have and would express about the current leadership of the coalition. That is no state secret; it has been in all the papers. What I am saying is that there are disparate views in the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being ignored in this debate&mdash;it needs to be said at least once&mdash;is that of course there are these views. As Senator Crichton-Browne said earlier, and I agree with him, there are 500 views. But this proposal is the collective view of the board of ATSIC and Senator Kernot knows that. All of these debates have occurred in the board. All of these views have been canvassed and expressed in the board. What needs to be said at least once is that, despite that, it is the collective view of the board of ATSIC. It needs to be said that these amendments should not be carried here this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I include my own party in this, to a lesser extent at the moment because we are in government and not in opposition, but it is as logical to say that the leader of the coalition should not be Dr John Hewson because one or two coalition members express a view to the contrary as it is to say that Paul Keating should not be the leader of the Labor Party because one or two might express views about that. There are none that I know of, I might add&mdash;particularly after the last election. Nevertheless, those statements lack the same degree of logic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course those diverse views are there, but what has to be acknowledged at least is that this proposal comes before the Parliament&mdash;this proposal has been brought by the Government to the Parliament&mdash;because the collective view of the board of ATSIC is that this should happen. That is a view I think we should respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague concluded by talking about Mabo, and I want to conclude by briefly talking about Mabo also. I commend again Mr Holding's speech at page 847 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He makes some very cogent points. There is a lot of confusion in the community about Mabo which needs to be fixed. I have expressed my views about that very strongly. There is nothing more fundamentally of concern than land tenure in this country, whether a person is black or white, and we do need to get a resolution to Mabo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the point needs to be made again that Mabo is not a policy of the Government that can be attacked or disputed. It is a decision of the High Court, just like the decisions that were brought down about section 92 of the Constitution, the most litigated section of the Constitution, and the decisions that were brought down, particularly under the leadership of Chief Justice Barwick, on the significance&mdash;Senator Watson would be more aware of it than any honourable senator in here&mdash;of the taxation regime of this country. Mabo has not caused and could not cause any more confusion than those decisions of the High Court caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a nonsense to suggest that corporations and mining companies did not legitimately take, as they were entitled to, advantage of those beneficial decisions. Of course they did. That is why I resent and reject this attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators should read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It has been stated that Aboriginal people should not use this decision as a bribe or a threat. Does anyone suggest that a mining company or a corporation is bribing or threatening someone when it goes to court and takes advantage of a legal decision that is beneficial to it? Of course they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought what Clyde Holding said about this&mdash;Senator Alston would not disagree with this&mdash;was quite right. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did the legal profession seriously complain when exactly that process brought forth a stream of litigation interpreting section 92? Half the lawyers I know who were involved in those matters educated their kids on the basis of those uncertainties.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely true. All I am saying is that a lot of confusion is being caused by these statements that, in respect of Mount Todd, this should not be used as a precedent. It was said by at least three coalition members this afternoon: `Aboriginal people should not use the Mabo decision which secured them a very good agreement with Mount Todd as a precedent because that is a threat or a bribe'. What nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation is that the High Court of Australia, in a case which was brought before it and which it has been considering for years, has brought down a legal decision which has been of beneficial effect, without question, to Aboriginal people in Australia. That has to be worked through. But I say again very strongly that it should not be asserted by anyone that Aboriginal people are unreasonably threatening or bribing anybody by taking the same beneficial advantage of that court decision, not government policy, as any other citizen of this country is entitled to take advantage of a court decision until parliament decides that it might express a different view. That is all I am saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill which is presently before the Senate is representative of the unseemly haste with which the Government nowadays processes a continuous stream of taxation Bills through this Parliament. The Bill before us is not really distinguishable from the Taxation Laws (Superannuation) Bill 1992 and is basically designed to give effect to the residual measures yet to be introduced from the statement entitled `Security in Retirement' made by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, other measures&mdash;some announced previously, some not&mdash;are sought to be introduced through the mechanism of this Bill, making a total of 12 changes to discrete areas of superannuation law and practice in this Bill. I will subsequently deal with each in turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of amendments to superannuation law and the pace at which they pass through the Parliament can only make one wonder how coordinated and holistic is the Government's approach to superannuation. After all, we have had a substantive change to superannuation law roughly every three months over the past decade. Let me anticipate the response to this observation from the other side of this chamber by saying that it is tedious and self-deluding to argue that such a lawyers' feast of legislative changes is due to the real or perceived failure of the Fraser government, a government that has been out of power for a decade. Perhaps a more independent and cynical observer would say that the Government is plucking the goose that laid the golden eggs, in aggregate now over $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ad hoc approach to superannuation policy apparently favoured by the Labor Government is interestingly reflected by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns) in his speech in the second reading of the Bill in the House of Representatives. The honourable member said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way that this Government tackles the superannuation agenda is to confront . . . problems as they arise and to solve them.</PARA>
<PARA>To say that the Government solves all superannuation problems may seem to many people an unwarranted assumption. I draw attention to the admission that problems are only addressed once they have arisen. The Government cannot allow itself to be satisfied with waiting for superannuation issues to become problems before it reacts to them. The Government must learn to anticipate problems and seek to avoid them, and not wait for problems or inequities to appear and then try to solve them one by one, like animals going into the ark. Such action creates unwieldy and uncoordinated legislation and difficulty and confusion for both providers and beneficiaries of superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has been assisted by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation led by Senator Sherry. I commend the honourable Parliamentary Secretary, Mr Johns, for his interest in and commensurate responsibility for superannuation, but I urge him to put his enthusiasm for superannuation to work in providing a more ordered and easily followed approach to superannuation by the Government than that which the community presently has to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to consider each of the 12 measures contained in this Bill for a detailed comment. First, I refer to the continuously complying fixed interest approved deposit funds. This measure will allow certain approved deposit funds to maintain their statutory qualification as continuously complying approved deposit funds, and consequent exemption from tax, by including within the requisite 90 per cent of accessible income test the disposal of long term securities alongside the former solitary income component of interest. This scheme is achieved by a simple extension of the definition of fixed interest complying approved deposit fund under section 290A(4). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an uncontroversial amendment in what it attempts to achieve, but I am disturbed by its retrospective effect so that it applies from 1 July 1988. I understand that the Government is acting in good faith and for good reason in making this amendment retrospective. However, one must ask why it has taken five years&mdash;from 25 May 1988 when the tax exemption concerned was first announced&mdash;to bring a normal income earning activity of an approved deposit funds within the policy intention of tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that this failure to anticipate fully the requirements properly to fulfil the policy intention is not atypical of this Government. Then, upon realising that more work is required to remedy past legislative failures, the Government seeks to depurate its own laws by retrospective legislation. In other words, the Parliament and the community must suffer the use of a repugnant doctrine of retrospectivity so that the Government's failures may be corrected. The need for and the worth of corrections in this first measure should not be derogated by what I say. However, I urge that superannuation changes be given fuller consideration so that, for example, we need not find ourselves legislating retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the second of the 12 matters, the notice requirements for superannuation funds. This previously unannounced amendment reverses the onus on the members of a superannuation fund who wish to claim a tax deduction for their personal contribution. The present situation is that a superannuation fund must include personal superannuation contributions in taxable contributions unless notice is received by the fund that the member is not entitled to a deduction from his assessable income for such contributions. In other words, contributions not covered by notices adverting to non-deductibility are deemed to be deductible contributions, whether they are in truth or not, and so taxable in the hands of the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arrangement was illogical because, as a general rule, those who receive contributions from an employer are not entitled to a deduction for any extra personal superannuation contributions they may choose to make. Obviously, the great majority of superannuation beneficiaries are really in this position. As such, it makes sense to reverse the present arrangement so that superannuation funds will now only include personal superannuation contributions in taxable contributions if they have received a notice stating the member's intention to claim a deduction for such a contribution. As the situation presently stands, notice must be given as to non-deductibility; under this Bill, notice must be given as to deductibility. To encourage people to give such notices, deductibility will not attach to personal superannuation contributions unless an acknowledgment of receipt of the notice of the fund is received by the member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the nature of the notice is reversed and the result of the receipt of the notice is reversed. I view the amendment positively but note that it is to apply from 1 July 1992 and that as we are approaching the end of this financial year people must extensively be made aware of this important change. I ask that suitable notice be given in the press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the third matter, the death benefit eligible termination payments. The Bill alters the tax treatment of death benefit eligible termination payments in the hands of beneficiaries or trustees of the estate so that benefits paid to dependants will be exempt from tax, whereas benefits paid to non-dependants will be taxed as ordinary eligible termination payments. More specifically, the post-June 1983&mdash;which is the important cut-off date&mdash;component of such eligible termination payments will be taxed at 15 per cent if it is paid from a taxed source, that is, the 15 per cent contribution, basically, or 30 per cent if paid from an untaxed source. Any benefits in excess of the deceased's reasonable benefits limit entitlements will be taxed as an excessive component of an eligible termination payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments simplify the tax treatment by dividing the eligible termination payments into two basic classifications, that is, whether paid to a trustee or directly to the beneficiary. The exemption from tax will be granted to a dependant by the wholly new section 27AAA(4). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it may be feared that the taxation of the eligible termination payment when paid to a non-dependant is analogous to a death duty, I think it should be remembered that presently such payments are taxable in the same way as they would be in the hands of the deceased. Whether this is tantamount to a death duty is not new and so not appropriate for comment in review of this Bill. The tax treatment has not changed but has been rationalised and made more coherent in its application. These measures were part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement</EMPHASIS> statement and will commence from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the fourth matter, the reasonable benefits limits. Another measure announced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement</EMPHASIS> statement is the move to assess lump sum superannuation benefits paid as a result of another's death against that other pension's reasonable benefit limit. This reverses the present situation wherein the payment is assessed against the recipient's reasonable benefits limit. It would appear reasonable that a person's ETP, if paid to another because of death, is assessed against that person's reasonable benefit limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the fifth matter, the taxation of excessive component. As a further part of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement</EMPHASIS> statement, the Bill proposes that the excessive component of an ETP be taxed at the top marginal rate as compared with the present arrangement whereby the excess is rendered as assessable income but taxed at the recipient's marginal rate, which obviously will vary. I note from the explanatory memorandum that this is the only measure in this Bill that will have a positive effect on revenue. Given that this is a substantive revenue raising change, rather than a technical or organisational one, it is worth trying to elicit the motivation behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Assistant Treasurer, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), adverted to this measure in their respective speeches during the second reading debate, but did no more than merely mention the measure. In particular, I notice that the honourable member for Petrie described this change as important but failed to state why it was important. The explanatory memorandum merely describes the mechanics by which the excessive component will be subject to the top marginal rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whilst the obvious assumption is that this measure is simply designed to ensure that any excess from a death benefit is treated in the same way as excess ordinarily in the hands of a beneficiary member of a superannuation fund, I do not think it satisfactory that we must be left to speculate, no matter how reasonably, on policy motivations for measures that increase government revenue. People are entitled not only to know what their government is doing but also why it is doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth point concerns allocated annuities. This sixth measure in the Bill introduces amendments that are sound in themselves. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1992 recognised allocated pensions and annuities for income tax purposes. However, these amendments did not ensure that the income derived by annuity providers&mdash;for example, life assurance companies&mdash;in respect of allocated annuity policies was exempt from tax. The amendments in this measure are necessary to ensure that income derived by an annuity provider in respect of allocated annuity policies is exempt from tax and that allocated annuities are not qualifying securities for division 16E purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I note that these measures are retrospective in effect to 22 December 1992 and that, not surprisingly, this necessity to legislate retrospectively is caused by the Government's failure to draft legislation sufficient in its terms to achieve the desired purpose. Briefly, the Tax Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1992 sought to recognise allocated annuities and pensions as pensions and annuities for income tax purposes. These initial amendments failed to extend the intended tax exemption to life assurance companies and registered organisations for income derived in respect of allocated annuity policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamentality of this error is apparent, but I find that the admission of this mistake is conspicuously absent in the respective speeches during the second reading debate of the honourable member for Canning and the honourable member for Petrie. I do not expect the Government to be without failings in the legislative enunciation of its desired policy changes. However, I do expect that sufficient respect be shown to the Parliament so that it might be allowed to fulfil its purpose as an effective means of review of executive action. This episode is an effective illustration of the theme in my earlier remarks and, I would hope, is a cautionary tale for those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh area refers to amendments relating to transferred retiree members of superannuation funds. The Bill proposes that the definition of `transferred retiree members' in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 be amended so that benefits may be funded from any rollover of an ETP. This measure should increase competition and choice and so is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eighth point concerns amendments to the notification of breaches of superannuation fund conditions. These amendments allow for the relaxation of the occupational superannuation standards regulations so that contributing employers need not be informed of temporary or minor breaches of superannuation fund conditions by the funds. While these amendments are explicable and reasonable, the need for contributing employers to be fully informed of the status or conditions of the particular funds they are contributing to on behalf of their employees must always be favoured in preference to the desirability of reducing administrative requirements upon funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments relating to prospectuses is point No. 9. In line with the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner's new responsibility for the supervision of superannuation funds' prospectuses&mdash;this supervisory role being previously with the Australian Securities Commission&mdash;it is not inappropriate that the same discretion to exempt or modify prospectus requirements which the ASC has also be placed in the commissioner's hands. The amendments do not create a new discretion, but simply shift it from one body to another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question does, however, remain whether a discretion appropriate for corporate offerings to people of whom it would be reasonable to expect to have some sort of financial sophistication is appropriate for the new age of superannuation. That is, the proliferation of superannuation funds offering products to the population at large should perhaps be subject to greater scrutiny than either companies offering shares are subject to or that superannuation funds used to be subject to. I think that raises some dilemma for the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tenth matter concerns the amendments relating to disclosure of information about particular superannuation funds. The Bill proposes to liberalise the power of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to release information about funds' compliance or non-compliance with standards and information that the fund has indicated it is willing to allow to be released. These proposals, if they successfully contribute to the flow of information to the consumers, are indeed worth while, but I think we have to treat that sort of thing with some caution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eleventh matter concerns the amendments relating to the reporting of ETPs for reasonable benefits limits. This penultimate measure grants an exemption from reasonable benefits limits reporting of payments up to a threshold of $5,000 for all payers of eligible termination payments, except those payers which extend withdrawal rights to depositors. I observe that this is another corrective exercise in that it repairs a previous inconsistency in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. The amendment speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The twelfth matter concerns the amendments relating to defined benefit superannuation schemes. Finally, the Bill proposes to allow defined contribution funds to elect to be treated as defined benefit funds for the purpose of enabling reserves or other surpluses to be taken into account in determining the level of support provided by an employer for employees under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concluding remarks are these. Overall, the Bill is uncontroversial. Nevertheless, the number of amendments here necessary to fulfil or correct incomplete past amendments prove that this Government's cavalier approach to tax legislation does create problems. Mistakes often necessitate the use of retrospective legislation to maintain consistent treatment. As parliamentarians, we should have a strong aversion to retrospective legislation because it is antipathetic to the rule of law. Parents are often wont to tell their children that, if they are going to do something, do it properly. The Government may do well to remember this little adage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">Senator Watson never ceases to amaze me in how exciting he can make legislation such as this sound and in the wise advice he gives us from time to time. I am going to concentrate on the substance of the legislation before us, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill 1993. As Senator Watson said, the legislation proposes to implement many of the taxation measures announced in the `Security in Retirement' statement of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) last year. It proposes to implement from 1 July 1994 a new taxation regime for death benefits, that is, a new regime for taxing payments from superannuation funds when the fund member dies so as not to allow excessive benefits to be transferred to beneficiaries free of taxation. I was expecting a bit of an Opposition beat-up on this issue. I thought the Opposition was going to spot a de facto death duty but, under the calm influence of Senator Watson, the Opposition has been very restrained on this one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes outlined will ensure that any superannuation benefits received by a person from a deceased person will be assessed against the deceased person's reasonable benefits limit and not interfere with the RBLs of living persons receiving such benefits. The new rules will treat death benefits on a consistent basis irrespective of whether or not they are received through an estate. Where a non-excessive benefit is paid to a dependant, it will be totally tax-free. Where such a benefit is paid to a person who is not a dependant of the deceased, it is taxed at 15 per cent if paid from a taxed source, or 30 per cent if paid from an untaxed source. Benefits paid in excess of a deceased person's RBL will be taxed as an excessive component irrespective of whether or not they are paid to a dependant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill also deals with the taxation of excessive components of benefits. Currently, these are taxed at the member's marginal tax rate. The Bill proposes to increase the tax to the top marginal rate of 47 per cent plus the Medicare levy. We think this is a very progressive measure. It will assist the equity of the superannuation system markedly over time. However, as is so often the case, this supposedly simple change involves incredibly complex amendments to the rates Act. Both these measures to which I have referred start on 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notice requirements concerning personal superannuation policies are also being revised to take into account the decision last year to eliminate the tax deduction for most employees contributing to these plans. I think we all remember this decision. This is where the Opposition, under Senator Alston's portfolio responsibilities, decided to out-GST Prime Minister Keating and said to people who held these superannuation policies, `We will not oppose this measure. If you want to get rid of it, you have to vote us into government'. Unfortunately, for the hundreds of thousands of people concerned, the Opposition did not win government. These people lost their tax break and, as I argued at the time, they lost the chance to top up what is essentially inadequate retirement income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be the Opposition's policy, but the Opposition is not doing anything about it. The contributions are taxable, but only where a tax deduction has been allowed to the member. Prior to 1 July 1992, almost all contributions obtained a tax deduction and, hence, were presumed to be taxable contributions unless the taxpayer provided a notice saying that she was not going to claim a tax deduction. Under the new rules, most contributions are not tax deductible and, hence, no contributions tax is payable. Accordingly, the notice requirements have been reversed so that a member must now give notice to the fund if she is going to claim a deduction for the contribution. Although I did not agree to the change in the deduction rules, I do accept that this move should reduce substantially the administrative task of the funds. Hence, we support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a technical amendment to the rules applying to continuously complying fixed interest approved deposit funds, or ADFs. This concession was introduced after action by former Democrats Senator Janine Haines to ensure that those members of superannuation funds who could not benefit from the imputation system were cushioned from the effects of the introduction of the tax on earnings and contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concession applies to those ADFs which receive at least 90 per cent of their earnings as interest. There is an anomaly in this test, because where investments mostly comprise fixed interest securities there will be gains and losses made on those securities. So even though all the income of the ADF may be gained from fixed interest investments, the ADF may not pass the test for exemption, even though there is no possibility of enjoying imputation credits. The Bill proposes to retrospectively fix this anomaly from 1 July 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently received a letter which seemed to me to contain evidence of another anomaly in the concession granted by section 290A. I ask Senator McMullan as Minister representing the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to comment on this and I ask the Government to examine it. The anomaly concerns the definition of an approved deposit fund. I have received a representation from a Melbourne man who thought&mdash;wrongly, it turns out&mdash;that his superannuation was entitled to the section 290A concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fund is an indefinitely continuing fund. It is maintained solely for approved purposes. In excess of 90 per cent of the income of the fund is interest from fixed interest investments. This man is over 55. The fund is a complying super fund under the OSSA legislation. He is the only member of the fund and he has not made any contributions to it since May 1988. The assets of the fund were rolled over from the person's employer funded superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This man is saying that the fund is functionally identical to ADFs, except that it fails the test that the trustee of an ADF must be a life office, a bank or another financial corporation. So he would argue that a taxpayer has inadvertently broken the law and faces a significant tax bill because, technically, he ran foul of the legislation, even though I think this is exactly the type of person that the concession was designed to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The man concerned did not get any benefit from the imputation system, yet he has been denied the section 290A concession, on a technicality. Perhaps the Government should review these types of situations and amend the law in accordance with the spirit and intention of the concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this Bill was originally introduced, the functions of ADFs were to be increased, as from 1 July 1994, by allowing them to provide pensions. Currently they are simply holding vehicles. The pensions were to be taxed in an identical manner to those paid by superannuation funds or life offices. I would ask the Minister to put down for the record why this change&mdash;which seems to us, anyway, to be ostensibly sensible&mdash;was abandoned and what caused the change in policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also makes some technical amendments to ensure that an annuity provider is exempt from tax in respect of allocated pensions. The law will simply ensure that allocated pensions are treated identically to normal pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OSSA legislation is amended in a number of ways to enhance the choice of pension providers available to retirees and to simplify some administrative burdens which apply where the fund fails to meet the provisions of the Act. There are also a number of amendments flowing from the superannuation guarantee charge system. These concern the release of information about the fund&mdash;information which may be desired by the public. This release of information does not impinge on the personal information of any members but concerns whether or not the fund is a complying fund, whether it is awaiting confirmation of such status or whether it is limited to accepting certain types of contributions&mdash;even something as simple as the business address of the fund, for example. These moves are to allow funds to provide meaningful information to the public to allow a better informed market and to increase competition between funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has the general support of the industry, and the Democrats support it. It would have been referred to the select committee for inquiry, but the non-contentious nature of the proposals and the need for quick passage have meant that there has been no need for a formal reference. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend several laws including the income tax legislation and the Corporations Law. It contains the measures foreshadowed in the joint statement by the Treasurer and the former Attorney-General on 2 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those measures included abolishing the existing priority of the Commissioner of Taxation for debts in relation to certain unremitted amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993. They also included measures to enable the Commissioner to recover the unremitted amounts more quickly through an estimation process and to encourage directors to face emerging problems as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of the Commissioner's priority</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner's priority currently applies to amounts deducted by employers from the salary or wages of their employees, and deductions of a similar nature, where those deductions are not paid to the Commissioner. The Commissioner's priority ranks debts for those deductions above all other debts of a person or company in a bankruptcy or insolvency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will remove the Commissioner's priority for debts in respect of those deductions, as well as certain other deductions such as those made from prescribed payments under the prescribed payments system. The amendments will apply to unremitted amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the amendments, debts due to the Commissioner, arising because of a failure to remit amounts deducted, will be treated in a similar manner to debts payable to other unsecured creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Estimation of unremitted amounts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in the Bill will enable the Commissioner to recover unremitted amounts more quickly by estimating those amounts which become payable after 30 June 1993 and by commencing recovery action on the basis of the estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will only make an estimate of the unremitted deductions when the due date has passed and those deductions have not been paid. The main objective of the new regime is to recover the actual deductions made. Ample opportunity will be provided to the person who did not remit the deductions, as required under the tax legislation, to inform the Commissioner of the actual amount deducted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors to be responsible for unremitted amounts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also make company directors liable for deductions made by their company and not remitted to the Commissioner. Currently, directors can be convicted in relation to their company's non payment of amounts deducted and can be ordered by a court to pay reparation equal to the deductions not remitted. This new measure will achieve this result more efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the theme of the recent amendments to the Corporations Law, this measure will ensure solvency problems are confronted earlier and the escalation of debts will be prevented. The amendments proposed will result in a company either meeting its obligations to pay amounts deducted to the Commissioner or going into voluntary administration or liquidation. Directors will only become liable for unremitted amounts when those options are not taken by their company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another feature of the arrangements will be a requirement on the Commissioner to notify directors who become liable for any unremitted amounts. He will be required to allow those directors a further period of 14 days, during which time the liability can be avoided if one of the options available is exercised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains defences for directors in recovery proceedings by the Commissioner. For example, it will be a defence if a director can prove that because of illness, or some other reason, the director did not take part in the company's management when the company failed to take one of the options available to avoid liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequential amendments to the Corporations Law, the Bankruptcy Act 1966 and the Crown Debts (Priority) Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes to amend the Corporations Law. The amendments are relatively minor and technical and support the measures to be included in the taxation law. Broadly, they seek to put the Commissioner in the same position as other creditors so that the Commissioner has clear access to all the remedies enjoyed by other creditors. The amendments to the other Acts are purely technical and consequential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of the Commissioner's priority is essential to the smooth operation of the proposed scheme of voluntary administration under the new insolvency provisions of the Corporations Law due to commence in June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the amendments to the Corporations Law which are contained in the Bill and has approved their introduction into Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue effect</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any loss of revenue from abolishing the priority will be offset by the revenue recovered under the new recovery regime. It is important for honourable Senators to  recognise the revenue recovered belongs to employees or payees and has been deducted but not remitted to the Commissioner as required by law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset that I support the comments made by my colleague Senator Watson that we are agreeing to debate the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 cognately very reluctantly. Together these Bills form a very important part of the taxation changes proposed by the Government and it is very difficult to deal with them seriously and comprehensively in the limited time that we have available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I will be containing my remarks in this debate to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). My colleague Senator Watson will be dealing with other items included in the other Bill. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) seeks to implement the taxation proposals outlined in the Labor Party's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS> statement of 9 February 1993, at the commencement of the last federal election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main tax items in that statement and contained in this Bill are, firstly, the introduction of a 10 per cent general investment allowance, similar to the one introduced by the Fraser Government in the early 1980s and ended by Labor in the 1984 Budget. That allowance will apply to eligible equipment acquired between 8 February 1993 and 1 July 1994. The second item is a reduction of 6c in the dollar in the company tax rate from 39c to 33c and a reduction from 30 per cent to 25 per cent in the pooled development funds rate, both commencing on 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there will be the phased reintroduction of a quarterly tax instalment system for company tax payments with an advanced payment schedule, which effectively brings forward revenue to the Commonwealth. Fourthly, there will be an extension of the fringe benefit tax exemptions for booking payments made by employers for private child-care places for their employees' children. This brings the treatment of payments for private centre places into line with public ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other measures contained in the Bill include some amendments to the taxation of foreign investment funds, which Senator Watson will be dealing with; an income tax exemption for defence force and federal police members undertaking activities in Somalia, Cambodia and the former Yugoslavia; a re-writing of the gift provisions in section 78 to make them much easier to use, which is a welcome advance; and an amendment granting the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs access to tax information to be used for `the purpose of assisting in the locating of persons who are unlawfully in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That latter item, which involves access to confidential tax records, is a matter of some concern. While the coalition in no way wishes&mdash;nor will it&mdash;to sanction illegal immigrants in Australia, we also very much respect the privacy of individuals' confidential records. It is therefore obligatory on the Tax Office&mdash;and I hope it will take very careful note of this&mdash;and also on the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that this new power be used very sparingly indeed as a last resort, and only to identify the whereabouts of these people. It must not become a Trojan horse for access to financial and income details. We will be very carefully monitoring this access provision. Where necessary, we will raise concerns with the Privacy Commissioner, whom we would also expect will have an involvement in the operation of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The item I mainly want to deal with relates to the reduction in the company tax rate from 39c in the dollar to 33c. That reduction would undoubtedly be welcome, as Australia seeks to move its tax rates closer to its Asian competitors, if it were responsibly funded. I will come back to that funding question later, but I point out that the irony in this measure is that just a week or so after the announcement of the reduction, Singapore announced a cut in its already lower than the Australian company tax rate. The problem is that under this Government we are only ever going part of the way some of the time. That is because of the Government's failure and unwillingness to undertake measures in other areas of its economic policy which would enable it to make the tax changes that would make us fully competitive with many of our competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems arising from this measure which I want to raise concerns about. Firstly, Australia's personal income tax rates are already way out of kilter with company tax rates. The existing company tax rate of 39 per cent is well less than the top marginal rate of, when we count in the Medicare levy, 48.4 per cent. This latest reduction will only widen the difference between the top personal rate and the company rate. That gap will inevitably lead to greater incorporation as businesses and individuals seek to take advantage of a lower tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those earning over $40,000&mdash;and that is about the figure at which the top marginal tax rate comes in, and that is not a high income overall&mdash;this gap will be worth, in tax rate terms, 15.4 per cent. Assurances by the Tax Office that it can deal with this gap and prevent tax leakage are difficult to accept. I hope that we will see some clearer evidence that this is a manageable issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second concern is that the reduction in the company tax rate will also have the secondary effect of devaluing the imputation credits attached to dividends paid to local investors. EPAC has calculated that the six per cent company tax rate cut is worth only 1.5 per cent to local investors, compared with 5.2 per cent for foreigners. In fact, the tax payable by local investors will actually be higher, at 31.8 per cent, than for foreigners, at 28.1 per cent. The result of this will be either lower Australian equity investment by individuals or increased dividend payouts by companies. The implications, in terms of investment, savings and the like, could be significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third concern is that this proposal will cost $1.8 billion, on the Government's costing. The Government simply does not have this sort of money to give away. The unfunded nature of this proposal is being met partly in the short-term by fiddling the timing of company tax instalments, which I will deal with separately. But in the end, it will be just another addition to the Budget deficit and to our public debt. That, of course, is already far too high. It will also lead to higher interest rates, and it staves off investment rather than encouraging it, as the Government claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fourth concern is that our indirect taxes, which add significantly to the costs of Australian business, are not being reduced. The Government may have reduced the tax on profits, but it has failed to address the competitiveness of sales. It continues to ignore the fundamental need to encourage the very income production which provides the tax base for company tax. Cost competitiveness is the key to individual company success&mdash;it is the key to income generation, profit generation and, therefore, to that tax base for individual companies&mdash;but it is also the key to Australia's success in export markets and import replacement. Whether a company is an individual company or is competing on the overseas market or the domestic market&mdash;either with or without import replacement&mdash;if it cannot gain a sale, then the rate of tax on profits is purely academic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach to this issue, of course, stands in stark contrast to that of the coalition. During the election the coalition promised the removal of no less than $20,000 million of input taxes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, $20 billion. It also gave business a tax advantage of several billion dollars through improved depreciation arrangements, all of which were fully funded. The net benefit to firms and their relative competitiveness would have been greatly enhanced by such moves. In fact, the eventual need to pay for this Government's company tax rate measure will, in all likelihood, based on experience, lead to higher costs on business through wholesale sales taxes; a new energy tax, which is obviously being mooted; higher government charges; or reduced corporate tax deductions, for instance, on superannuation contributions. There is no way that the Government's figures add up at the moment. Some fundamental changes will have to be made by way of tax increases, unless there are necessary offsetting expenditure reductions, in order to even start moving towards a balancing of the books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was distressing to hear Senator Evans in Question Time today, in response to my question, confirm that the Government is not to make any moves at all in the coming financial year to reduce the Budget deficit from its horrendous level of something like $16 billion. Heaven knows what that is going to do to confidence in the economy, investor confidence and confidence from overseas partners and investors; heaven knows what it is going to do to the dollar; and heaven knows what it is going to do to the whole structure of our debt situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reintroduction of quarterly company tax instalments, whilst a welcome move, is being implemented for all the wrong reasons; namely, to bring forward company tax collections simply to shore up the Government's Budget over the next few years. You will recall, Mr Acting Deputy President, that the disastrous 85 per cent-15 per cent instalments were also introduced in 1988 to assist the Budget rather than business cash flows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of the present measure&mdash;in other words, to go back to the quarterly payments&mdash;will be to strip corporate Australia of $600 million next year, $1.6 billion in 1995-96 and a further $1.7 billion in 1996-97. That money which otherwise could have gone to purchasing new equipment or stock will now end up in the Treasury coffers to be spent elsewhere. The Government has robbed Peter to pay Paul within the corporate structure and, in doing so, it will add to business costs; almost certainly add to interest rate pressures; and, therefore, almost certainly reduce the competitiveness of Australian business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about cash flow?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my friend Senator Watson says, it will make the cash flow situation more difficult for some businesses. What does the package as a whole mean? Taken in the context of the new Labor Government's enormous Budget deficit problems, and coming on top of the legislated personal income tax cuts, it means that the Commonwealth will have yet more unfunded measures to try to grapple with in the future. It means that the Government will add to its already significant borrowings over the next few years, which is the same thing as saying that the Government will run down our nation's savings. The Government is drawing down our national savings, whilst all the rhetoric of government is that it has, as a top priority, the building of the nation's savings. What it says in the fine rhetoric is totally contradicted by its performance and its actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means that the legislated personal income tax cuts and the huge spending promises that were made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during the election campaign are unsustainable. Inevitably, what we will have is either tax rises and/or expenditure cuts&mdash;probably both. It means that what Labor is now claiming to give with one hand it will have to get back with both down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to follow the daily press and the numerous speeches from government members, Ministers, officials, commentators, businessmen, economists and academics to realise that it is inevitable that the Labor Government will hit families hard with new and/or higher tax measures. The Prime Minister is going to do a Bill Clinton: he has promised tax cuts but he will deliver tax rises. We have so far heard rumours of an energy tax&mdash;a la Bill Clinton&mdash;a broadening of the wholesale sales tax and/or its extension into government activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way in the world that we will go through the next parliamentary session without an extension of indirect taxes into the services area. In other words, what we will have is a GST by another name but without any of the offsetting benefits that the coalition's policy proposal brought with it. We will see increased GBE dividend charges&mdash;read `taxes to users'; in all probability we will see the deferring of personal income tax cuts, and/or the introduction of a services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This need for extra revenue arises because the Government has presided over the worst deterioration in the Commonwealth's budgetary position since the Second World War. Over the last three years alone the Commonwealth's budgetary position has deteriorated by more than $30 billion on a cumulative basis. That figure is in excess of seven per cent of GDP. On current independent projections&mdash;they are not mine&mdash;it could mean the Commonwealth borrowing no less than another $60 billion in the next four years. That, of course, is $60 billion worth of savings, both national and foreign, which will add to our foreign debt and severely limit our national productive investment. With our very low national savings and, in fact, dissavings for the last seven quarters&mdash;unprecedented in our history and one of the most serious long-term problems that we have ever faced and will face in the future&mdash;that is $60 billion which Australia cannot afford now and in particular cannot afford in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Prime Minister talks up national identity and an Australian republic, he is going flat out selling out our national sovereignty to foreigners, passing our national assets to overseas control and driving us quite unashamedly towards that infamous banana republic of which he boasted in 1986. Whilst the coalition will not oppose the measures contained in this Bill, we will wait with great interest for the next couple of taxation amendment Bills in this Parliament. There can be little doubt that they will be jam-packed with proposals for new or expanded taxes. Before the Government rushes in to introduce those Bills, I would remind it that it should bear well in mind that the one thing for which this Government does not have a mandate is new taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill was introduced during the last session of Parliament but it lapsed because of the election. It has been reintroduced in the same form, except for one additional transitional measure concerning amendments to the capital gains tax. This is another omnibus Bill dealing with various income tax, capital gains tax, PAYE and fringe benefits tax matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A technical amendment is proposed to deal with the problems of the unique nature of the leave conditions of waterfront employees. The employment practices in the industry mean that employees are unlikely to work for one employer for long enough to use their accrued leave, such as long service leave. So an employer makes payments on behalf of an employee to the person's new employer in respect of accrued leave. Under the current law an employer is only allowed a tax deduction when the leave payment goes to the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stevedoring most employees do not remain with an employer for long enough to accrue the full amount of long service leave, so it is perfectly reasonable that the system make special provision for the particularities of a special industry. This Bill does so, and the Australian Democrats support this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill, though, ignores the wider question of the appropriate tax treatment of provisions made by companies for accrued long service leave liabilities, indeed any leave liabilities. It is good business practice to set aside resources as and when liabilities accrue. Indeed, we now have a situation where some States are very concerned that this path has not been followed in the past with respect to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the law does not recognise the setting aside of moneys to cover actual accrued liabilities as a tax deduction. Indeed, subsection 51(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act specifically precludes a deduction being granted to the employer until the leave is actually paid. The Democrats would argue that this provision is unfair in that it does not recognise the commercial reality of our industrial law. Once an employee's right to a benefit is fully vested, then there is no doubt that a liability has been incurred by the employer. Consequently, a deduction should be allowed to reflect that commercial reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Nilsen Development Laboratories case it was held that a deduction was allowable in respect of accrued liabilities. The government of the day enacted the current subsection 51(3) to overcome this decision, although the commissioner subsequently won an appeal to the High Court. The rule is being adjusted to take into account the individual situation applying in the waterfront industry. This amendment would not have been necessary if the provision had been more commercially realistic in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of proposed amendments in this Bill to the capital gains tax. A simplification proposal is to introduce a general anti-avoidance provision concerning inter-group rollovers and the repeal of the current myriad of anti-avoidance provisions. There are also a number of highly technical amendments concerning other capital gains tax matters. In addition there is a new regime, as promised by the Government last year, for the treatment of depreciable property installed on crown leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes a number of technical changes to what seems to be a hopelessly complex depreciation regime now in force. These appear to be detrimental to taxpayers and will need close scrutiny. I am sure Senator Watson, who was instrumental in sending the legislation to the Finance and Public Administration Committee for public hearing, will no doubt be thoroughly investigating these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be the rewriting of the motor vehicle cost price depreciation limit provisions. The new regime alters the basis of the system from one of tax years to one of financial years. Under the current rules a taxpayer with a substituted accounting period, that is, a year which does not match the financial year, may be entitled to a higher depreciation limit than a taxpayer with a normal accounting period, where the two people buy an identical motor vehicle and first use it on the same date. So there is a distortion, but it is a minor one and the new regime proposes to fix it. In the scheme of things it seems a strange priority, almost bordering on the trivial, but the Democrats will support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will also be some further tightening of the dividend streaming arrangements by broadening the existing restrictions to apply to situations involving interposed entities. Dividend streaming involves planning to distribute franked and unfranked dividends to those taxpayers who can best utilise them. The Government is concerned that the provisions not be abused at some cost to revenue. This seems  perfectly reasonable, and we support this anti-avoidance measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a tiny technical amendment to the fringe benefits tax legislation which reflects the change in the structure of the Commonwealth Bank group. As well, under this legislation, the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission is to be granted the status of a law enforcement agency for the purposes of getting access to taxation information. Again this is a sound move, and the Democrats support this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators will probably remember that not so long ago this issue was before this chamber in a completely different context. At that time, Mr Reith was quite correctly pointing out the double standard which the current Prime Minister was applying in assisting the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland yet not assisting the WA Inc. royal commission. We remember that, after a few days, the Prime Minister relented and agreed to change the law. We now have a satisfactory information sharing regime which is not tainted by partisanship. A new addition to the gift list will be those gifts of over $2 made before 30 June 1995 to the Shrine of Remembrance Restoration and Development Trust. This is a worthy addition as the project is one of national significance. This status should help the trust to raise the money it needs, and we strongly support this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the PAYE provisions are to be amended in two respects. Firstly, those young people employed under the landcare and environment action program known as LEAP&mdash;the environment corps which was established at the youth unemployment summit last year in a measure which the Australian Democrats wholeheartedly support&mdash;receive a taxable training allowance. Although it is taxable it is not within the definition of salary and wages and hence no instalments can be deducted each fortnight. This Bill will remedy this technical deficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter is the treatment of the remuneration of members of local government. Local government has successfully fought off having the PAYE provisions apply to councillors' allowances. The new provisions will apply on an optional basis. The individual councils will be able to opt in to the PAYE provisions if the council unanimously adopts a resolution to that effect. It will be very interesting to see whether any councils do avail themselves of this option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second Bill we are debating, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, is a further omnibus taxation Bill which proposes amendments in the area of income tax and fringe benefits tax. Apart from the company tax decision, which I will deal with last, the Bill proposes to introduce an investment allowance. One could say that this is a blatant political countermeasure to a virtually identical proposal floated in Fightback II. An investment allowance is an investment incentive which grants an extra deduction on top of the existing depreciation and development allowance arrangements on capital investment. It is an incentive to invest, but it is neutral in the sense that it applies to all sectors equally. The measure is for a short time&mdash;it applies to investments made between the date of the announcement, which was 9 February 1993, and 1 July 1994. It is budgeted to cost $130 million in the first year, $330 million in 1994-95, and $270 million in 1995-96. These costings have been questioned as being too conservative by some people. If they are, it means that investment has been underestimated, and I think that is one of the risks that we can live with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pooled development funds are venture and development capital entities which are currently taxed at the concessional rate of 30 per cent. The Government is proposing to cut this to 25 per cent. It may seem a minor matter, but it is an important one as we know that historically there has been a problem of availability of capital at a reasonable cost for small and medium sized businesses. I have spoken on this issue on many occasions in this place. One recent proposal I have looked at involves a central fund for the unclaimed benefits of superannuation fund members and the use of this fund for venture and development capital. I hope the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation will look at this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To its credit, the Government is now addressing the issue of the availability of capital in a number of ways. There is this PDF system whereby investors are offered a reduced company tax rate to induce them to invest in riskier projects. There are the altered arrangements with the Australian Industry Development Corporation, especially the new product STAR, which was specifically designed to mobilise some of the assets in industry superannuation funds into equities. There is also the proposal to boost the ability of banks to lend to the critical small and medium sized business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is addressing the problem. It is better than the previous response, which was to deny there was a problem or, failing that, get the Industry Commission to come in and deny there was a problem in this area. The Opposition&mdash;I suppose for ideological reasons&mdash;opposed pooled development funds from the start. I trust the Opposition will be supporting this measure tonight, indicating that it has reassessed its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fringe benefits tax is a tax imposed on non-cash benefits paid to employees by employers. We have always said that it is a very fair tax. The system is designed so that all benefits are taxed unless they are specifically exempted. There are many exemptions, including some concerning child-care benefits. This Bill proposes to increase the existing exemptions for contributions for priority of access payments from only those made to an eligible child-care centre under the Child Care Act 1972 to include priority of access payments made in respect of family day care, care outside school hours or care in school vacations. What these terms actually embrace will be set out in the employer contribution guidelines which will be issued by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Community Services. I think this is a major step forward for child care because basically all types will be treated equally before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign investment fund measures were essentially anti-avoidance ones which commenced on 1 January. They are incredibly complex and in need of technical amendment in a number of areas. I will not detail them here, although I expect Senator Watson will look at them at the hearing on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the defence and police forces are now on regular overseas duty on behalf of the United Nations. Destinations include the former Yugoslavia, Cambodia and Somalia. It has long been the practice to exempt from income tax the pay and allowance of members serving within war zones. These measures simply continue that practice and they have the full support of the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income tax law works on the basis of voluntary compliance. A key aspect of this is the fact that taxpayers can be confident that their tax records are completely secret when lodged with the Tax Office. Hence, there are very strict secrecy rules and very harsh penalties if these are broken. Recognising, though, that there are some circumstances where the public interest overrides the private interest of the taxpayer concerned, there are some circumstances where it is appropriate to disclose the information. Some examples are for law enforcement actions, royal commissions, fraud control with the Department of Social Security, et cetera. This Bill proposes to allow access to the department of immigration to ensure compliance with immigration law, especially visa conditions regarding employment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gift provisions, which grant tax deductible status to donations of money or property in excess of $2, have mushroomed over the past 57 years.

This is part of the ongoing task&mdash;which must be absolutely daunting&mdash;of making the taxation law decipherable and reasonably easy to read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter I wish to discuss tonight concerns the major revenue item in these Bills. This is the proposal to reduce the rate of company tax. Companies are separate legal entities from their shareholders and, as such, they earn income and pay tax on that income. Personal income tax, by comparison, is a multirate progressive tax. It has a tax free&mdash;that is, a zero percentage&mdash;ban and progressively higher marginal tax rates as income increases. This ensures that the average rate of tax payable increases as income increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Company tax is a single rate tax. There is no tax-free threshold. Currently, the rate is 39 per cent. The Fightback proposal was to increase the rate of company tax from 39 per cent to 42 per cent. In the uncertainty of those days leading up to the election there was obviously a political mileage too great to resist and the Government outbid the coalition by proposing to cut the tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent from 1 July 1993. I think this proposal shocked many in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A cut in the rate of company tax will benefit all profitable companies, and that is the point. Their contribution will be cut by about 20 per cent, and this represents about $1.7 billion per annum. This windfall will be recouped by the Commonwealth by bringing forward existing company tax payments into a current year quarterly system. Basically this is structured to make companies pay less tax earlier. After 1996-97&mdash;that means 1997-98 and beyond&mdash;this funding source will dry up and then there will be a permanent $1.7 billion increase in the deficit&mdash;a bit of tricky footwork there. The beneficiaries of this cut will be domestic shareholders whose shares will increase in value due to the reduced company tax. </PARA>

They may be expected to try to win some better wages and conditions once they understand the import of this legislation. But the losers will be people who rely on the services which would have been provided by the company tax&mdash;that is, the ordinary PAYE taxpayers, especially those who earn under $20,700 per year and who do not benefit from the personal income tax because of the thresholds that have been set by this Government. Indeed, one does not get anything from this if one earns under $20,700 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rhetoric being run is that this gives us a more competitive business tax system and will increase investment. It might be true, but the method is about the bluntest instrument to achieve such an outcome. It only benefits those companies which make a profit. Since in Australia at the moment we have double digit unemployment, surely the priority should be to help people find work but not to cut taxes for the very wealthy. This tax delivers a massive windfall to existing companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. Both Bills reflect the rapid change to tax law spearheaded by the Labor Government and its tax architect, the former Taxation Commissioner, Trevor Boucher. The new commissioner, Mr Michael Carmody, now has the job of fitting in the missing pieces&mdash;details that should have been part and parcel of the earlier legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has limited the second reading debate to 20 minutes, meaning 10 minutes for each of these two long, complicated and technical Bills with extensive implications for business in Australia. The Senate is referring both Bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for further scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the earlier speakers for their contribution. I must say the coming of Senator Kernot as their spokesperson for Treasury matters has certainly raised the level of debate from the Australian Democrats, and I thank her for her contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill is technically the same Bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives on 16 December 1992 as the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7). The only major change is within certain transitional capital gains provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of measures in this Bill have caused the coalition some concern. For example, there are far too many elements of retrospectivity. Firstly, I refer to the amendments regarding accrued leave payments. This measure is concerned with payments made by a former employer to a current employer in respect of the accrued leave entitlements of employees whose services are being transferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the intention is that only a few industries will be affected by the provision, namely industries in which employees change employers so frequently that awards permit entitlements to leave to be based on total service with a number of employers, I believe that a literal reading may give this amendment a much wider and an unintended scope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also concerns me that the drafting of the proposed legislation has created some unintended consequences. A literal reading of this section deems it to have effect since 1978. For practical purposes, the retrospective aspect would be four years. While the coalition has concerns about retrospectivity, in this case the retrospectivity provides some benefit to certain classes of taxpayers. However, the Senate must not overlook the fact that the other retrospective element within the same measure could create doubts about prior application of certain awards which many employers, other than those affected on the waterfront, may not know much about. Allowing this retrospectivity may encourage award changes in other industries to enable employers to pick up the liability when employees change jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum claims that in practice the retrospective character of the amendment will not disadvantage taxpayers because the amendment will give effect to the interpretation of the law which the Commissioner of Taxation has applied from the commencement of section 51(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act until 24 August 1989, when the commissioner changed his earlier interpretation as a result of the decision in the TNT Skypack case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, I think it should be noted that the TNT Skypack case involved the sale of a business, whereas section 51(3), introduced in 1978, sought to deny deductions essentially for provisions for such things as long service leave and sick pay, and to allow the deduction only when the benefit was paid when the leave was taken or a benefit was derived by a beneficiary of the deceased person who derived the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is remarkable to consider that since 1978 section 51(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act has denied a deduction in respect of leave payments unless they are made to the employee or to his or her estate. Business is of the belief that the amendments should have been much more narrowly drafted so as to clearly confine their operation to the issue at hand and that the amendment should not be retrospective. We will have to consider the possibility of an amendment after hearing some explanations during the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the coalition is concerned about the retrospective aspect contained in the depreciation broadbanding measures. The broadbanding legislation needed amending, and I have no doubt that this has occurred. A literal interpretation could have led to an item of plant at a higher rate than that intended by the drafter of the legislation. No-one would really be worried about an amendment to fix a mischief of that kind, but it is quite a different matter to legislate for the change to have a retrospective effect. Not only is retrospective legislation wrong in principle; in this instance it will mean that taxpayers who have been prepared and have lodged their returns based on the black letter of the law&mdash;and that is important&mdash;would now have to lodge amended returns. Unnecessary time, effort and money will be spent&mdash;all because of poor drafting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other depreciation refinements are also included. These cover, for example, depreciable property installed on crown leases, the adjustment of the depreciation cost price limit, as well as options to specify lower rates being removed. I commend the Government for extending the provision to cover a situation in which a vehicle has to be modified to allow people with disabilities access through wheelchairs. This is consistent with the concessional treatment granted in sales tax legislation and is symmetrical. Therefore, I believe that it is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains a number of amendments which seek to remedy inconsistent technical problems in conjunction with the capital gains tax provisions. For example, changes will ensure that the capital gains provisions do not apply to tax an amount where an amount would otherwise be included in assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem brought to my attention in this regard is that the new section does not cover the situation whereby a club hires an asset to a member&mdash;that is a voluntary club or association&mdash;and the receipt is not protected by section 23(g), 160K(1), or 160Z(8), and whether section 160M(7) will assess the gross consideration. I will raise this issue further when the Bill is referred to committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that this Bill has incorporated a number of provisions which have been raised by business with the Australian Taxation Office with regard to corporate rollover amendments and the disposal of assets within a company group. It is good to see that the Government has listened, at least in part, to the concerns raised by the Taxation Institute of Australia on behalf of a number of businesses in this particular category. The changes introduced in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and which were not contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 7) 1992 should allow the maximum flexibility for assets to be transferred between companies within a wholly owned corporate group to both maximise economic efficiencies and reduce unnecessary compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also welcomes capital gains amendments which concern the principal residence exemption and the cancellation of statutory losses. The coalition also commends to the chamber the amendments covering dividend streaming, rollover relief for petroleum mining, the tax deductibility of gifts to the Shrine of Remembrance Restoration and Development Trust in Melbourne and the PAYE provisions&mdash;in particular the ability of an employee with more than one employer to obtain from the Tax Office a single variation in PAYE tax instalment deductions which will apply to more than one employer. However, I do believe it is my place to query how this change will affect the 15 per cent instalment tax rate deduction concession, which is currently in vogue, granted to employers in certain primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Bills contain intrusions into the privacy provisions of the Tax Administration Act and section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The first Bill will allow the provision of tax information to the Queensland Criminal Justice Commissioner. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to furnish information to the Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs for the purpose of locating persons who are unlawfully in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises privacy provisions. I would have thought that any responsible government with a concern for privacy issues would have had, concurrent with this legislation, a privacy amendment because what is really needed in terms of releasing further information unprotected by the privacy provisions of section 16 of the Income Tax Act or section 3 of the Tax Administration Act is a complementary change to the Privacy Act to allow for the Privacy Commissioner to audit who has used that information and how. I ask the Government to act because we are seeing more and more extensions and liberalisations of the privacy provisions without adequate privacy protections. I think such a mechanism is needed in the interests of protecting the privacy of so-called innocent persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. I do so quickly because I do not wish to canvass issues raised by Senator Kernot and by my colleague Senator Short, who made a very fine contribution. This Bill makes provision for a 10 per cent margin of error in estimating corporate income. I remind the Senate that that does not match up with a 15 per cent margin which applies to provisional taxpayers. The question arises as to why the Government believes that corporate officers have better foresight in estimating the income of corporate organisations than provisional taxpayers have in estimating theirs. I believe that this anomaly needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company rate is to be reduced from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. The reduction in the corporate rate hopefully should  stimulate some new corporate investment. I acknowledge that, but it will not do much to lower the cost structure because most firms do not always take the tax component into account when calculating their costs. It is far better, as Fightback states, to lower the cost structure by taking those hidden taxes out of business costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a report by the Economic Planning Advisory Council, which suggests that the reduction of the company tax rate will only deliver marginal benefits to local firms. The reduction will mean that Australia will become more attractive for foreign investment as the promised six per cent cut to the company rate will reduce the final tax cost to foreigners for new investments here by 5.2 percent to 28.1 percent. In comparison, the real cost to local investors will be reduced by only 1.5 per cent to 31.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) informed the House of Representatives at Question Time that the reduction would mean a tax rate comparable with that of Singapore and about the average for countries in the Asian region. In other words, it is meant to give Australia an advantage. However, the Prime Minister seems to have either forgotten or does not know that Singapore has just reduced its company tax rate to 27 per cent and there are further plans for a reduction to 25 per cent. Thus, we are not comparable with Singapore and never will be because Singapore plans to undercut the advantage Australia was presumably to obtain by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern has been expressed that, given the disparity between the top marginal rate of 48.4 per cent from 1 July, which includes the Medicare levy, and the proposed company tax rate of 33 per cent, incorporation may be a very attractive option for some classes of taxpayer. It is generally thought that certain taxpayers will incorporate despite the Australian Taxation Office and the Government saying that the anti-avoidance law is adequate to prevent such change. In all cases, from where I stand, I do not believe that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business has queried whether the Government might not reconsider the activation of Division 7, at least in relation to private companies that do not earn the majority of their income from active business. Something will have to be done to stem the flow of money. Another sideline of the change will be that franked dividends will be less attractive since the imputation credit to shareholders will drop from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Companies will be under pressure from shareholders to pay out a higher dividend to maintain shareholders' net dividend income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPAC report questions whether Australians will invest more themselves because the system of dividend imputation actually washes out the benefits of corporate tax concessions to shareholders as the gap between the company rate and the personal income tax rate widens with the lowering of the corporate tax rate. Foreign investors do not confront the same problems as they do not pay the same personal tax rates as local shareholders by virtue of the implications of the franked credit system and international agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change in the corporate tax rate will also affect the insurance industry as there is to be no change to the tax rates applying to certain categories in this industry. However, I understand that discussions have been occurring between the Taxation Office and the insurance industry concerning the appropriate basis for taxing the general fund or non-fund income of a mutual company. Now suddenly the industry discovers without warning, according to statements made in the explanatory memorandum, the Government has effectively decided that because the company is owned by the policyholders all the funds held are in fact insurance funds and should be taxed accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This ignores the fact that policyholders of a mutual company have two sets of rights. They have rights as a policyholder in which there is a contractual obligation between the policyholder and the company according to the respective policy documents. They also have rights as members of the company in accordance with the company's constituting documents. These two rights seem to be confused in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be remembered that the function of the general fund, or non-fund, of a mutual company stands in exactly the same way as the shareholders' fund in a proprietary company. The general fund has gained greater significance with the Life Act requirements under these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the general investment allowance. I believe that this is a not unreasonable measure. But life assurance companies have been prejudiced from being able to claim the allowance on new plant and equipment that they purchase. This applied to the development allowance and, under this legislation, it will apply to the investment allowance. It applies in circumstances in which the companies are providers for beneficiaries who are annuitants and that proportion of tax in the life assurance company's hands, as such, is exempt. This creates some problems for the industry in that it tends to deny it access to both the development allowance passed last year and the investment allowance which we are debating at the moment. Why this discrimination? It is quite unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to follow through the whole of subdivision B, the development allowance of part III of the Act. It is clear from section 82AA that the property to which the allowance is to be applied is that which is used by the taxpayer, wholly and exclusively in Australia, for the purpose of producing assessable income; that is, the end user of an eligible item must use that property for the above purpose. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that the new allowance is to apply only to plant and equipment used wholly and exclusively for producing assessable income. This being so, life companies and superannuation funds will not be eligible for the deduction for equipment that they acquire for use in their businesses because of the apportionment of investment income to current pension and immediate annuity business.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation seems grossly unfair, and I would like the Government to comment. It is an issue that we will certainly raise at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go to my next point I raise the question of whether mutual income, which is taxed at the trustee rate, is really taxed at the appropriate rate. If we look at some actuarial studies we see that many policyholders' average tax rate is now well below 39 per cent. It seems quite unfair that this group of people should be taxed at the rate of 39 per cent, the trustee rate, when the ordinary corporate rate is 33 per cent. I believe this discrimination should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also covers amendments to the fringe benefits tax in that it extends the exemption which is currently available to priority of access payments to eligible child-care centres to priority of access payments to family day care, outside school hours care and occasional care. The coalition, naturally, welcomes this move as well as the amendments to the foreign investment funds measures enacted last year, and the income tax exemption for defence force personnel and federal police serving in certain areas: Cambodia, Somalia and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment is in the form of a compliment&mdash;I see the tax officers smiling for once. It is pleasing to see that section 78 covering gift provisions has been restructured. It is a lot easier to read and to follow; so I say congratulations. I look forward to seeing many more sections of the income tax legislation similarly handled. In that way I believe we will have a much more easily understood, comprehensible and useful income tax Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately two tax Bills. I will really be dealing only with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) because of the time. That Bill contains a measure to reduce the rate of income tax for most companies in Australia from 39 cents in the dollar to 33 cents, the introduction of a revised company tax collection arrangement and an extension of the child care exemption currently available to priority access payments to eligible child-care centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It contains a number of other things, including an amendment of the secrecy provisions in relation to the provision of certain information concerning unlawful immigrants. I strongly oppose that measure. I very strongly oppose the provision of taxation information&mdash;tax file numbers, et cetera&mdash;by the taxation department to the immigration department. It is a shame that the Government has put forward this proposal to turn the Tax Office into ferrets for the immigration department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a dangerous measure. It will create a large, totally illegal economy in which sweated, illegal migrant labour will be outside both the tax and industrial relations system. Illegal immigrants will thus undercut the wages and conditions of ordinary workers as has happened in the United States of America where this particular proposal was adopted. I wonder whether the Government can provide us with any economic analysis of the effect of this measure, drawing on the United States experience with farm labour in places like California. I hope that matter is raised at the committee hearing on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has the Government also considered the public health aspects of the measure?

There is not time to go into that matter now but I will be dealing with it next week when this matter comes before the Committee of the Whole.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the reduction of company tax for most companies in Australia from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Senator Watson, in his very illuminating and excellent address to the chamber on the second reading, said that this was due to pressure from international competition. He indicated that company tax has not caught up with international competition, and I think he said the company tax rate in Singapore is 27 per cent. How far are we going to chase this rabbit? How many holes are we going to go down? How far are we going to drop the company tax rate? When we are considering this matter we have to consider it in the overall sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to have these debates from time to time. It is unfortunate that we have only a very short time to debate these important matters, but it is very important to debate them as matters of principle. In my view, in recent times there has been a relatively greater reliance on the taxation of labour as opposed to taxation on capital or land. The pressure of international competition has seen company tax rates reduced to 33 per cent, and the granting of full imputation of company tax credits to shareholders to avoid double taxation of profit. The result of that was adverted to by Senator Kernot&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. As Senator Watson said, it is of greater benefit to foreigners than to Australians. At the same time the withholding tax is set at 10 per cent, and there are exemptions which can mean large capital raisings generate Australian source income which bears no Australian tax at all. The gradual abandonment by the Commonwealth of the taxation of capital is understandable to a certain extent, as I have indicated, but that still leaves a choice to be made whether to tax land, which embraces all natural resources, or labour. Labour income, especially pay as you earn income, has borne the brunt of Commonwealth taxation in recent years. Those who have borne it most of all are the families. They are being discriminated against in comparison with companies. My view is that income should be taxed in the hands of the ultimate beneficial recipient of the income. The taxation principle ought to be that an income is taxed according to the number of dependants upon that income. That is not the case at the present moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unjust that family income sharing is presumed by social security law and practice but denied under taxation law. For example, the Government's rationale for abolishing the junior unemployment benefit was that under-18-year-olds should be supported at home by their parents, but it gave no extra tax threshold to the parents paying for that budgetary saving. By contrast, the principle of tracing income to the ultimate beneficiary is well accepted in the taxation of ordinary trust, partnership and company income. The income of trusts or partnerships is not taxed in the hands of the trustee or partnership firm. It is quite correctly taxed in the hands of the trust beneficiaries or partners. Analogously, the income of companies, whilst originally taxed in the company's hands, now carries a credit to ensure that trading profits are taxed as much as if they were derived directly by shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle is well accepted in the case of deceased estates and family law settlements where income out of family maintenance or testamentary trusts for children is taxed as the child's income and not as income of either the custodial or non-custodial parent. The principle is accepted in the social security system, which splits the income of a married pensioner couple and allows one partner's unused pensioner tax rebate to be transferred to the other. Yet the principle is rejected in the case of pay-as-you-earn taxpayers on the legal precept that the income of a wage or salary earner is his or hers alone. This precept has no regard to any obligation under common law or Family Law Act for a wage earner to share income with his or her spouse and children under his or her duty to maintain them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, every statistical collection based on the household recognises the economic reality that a vast degree of income redistribution goes on in the household. The legalistic rejection of tax recognition of the economic reality of intra-family income sharing hits workers hard, especially those males and females trying to support a family on one income. They will be paying far more tax in percentage terms than the present 33 per cent that applies to company tax. It is a curious irony of our fiscal system that the tax treatment of the children of divorced or deceased millionaires can be more equitable than that of ordinary pay-as-you-earn workers and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the question of tax exemptions for child care and point to an anomaly in that area. This matter might also be raised at the meeting on Friday. I will certainly be raising it during the Committee of the Whole debate when this Bill comes back before the Senate next Monday or Tuesday. The Bill extends the exemption from fringe benefits tax for employer paid child care. Payments for family day care, outside school hours care and vacation care will now be tax-free if paid for by the employer. I question the equity of that arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under sections 47(2) and 47(8) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act, child care provided by an employer is an exempt fringe benefit provided that the child is being cared for by someone who is not a relative and is being cared for outside his or her home. The definition of `child-care facility' under section 136(1) of the Act expressly excludes a facility at the place of residence of any of the children being minded. So much for the Australian dream of a backyard for the kids to play in. Only a bureaucrat could invent a definition of `family day care' which excludes the care of a child at home. When one thinks about it, it is extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This discrimination against home-grown child care hardly seems to score on the Treasury's fabled level playing field. Does the Government think that the worst that can happen to a child would be for the child to be cared for at the child's own home? If not, why do we not amend the definition of child-care facility in section 136 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to read `a place or residence where a person minds, cares for or educates children' and remove the restriction in sections 47(2) and 47(8)? Why continue this ludicrous situation? I will be pursuing this inequity further in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the treatment of an employee's child-care expenses depend on whether he or she can find an employer willing to subsidise them?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to an article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which pointed out that the latest estimates from ABARE indicate that real wool prices will grow by only 6c to 551c between now and 1997. In light of these poor predicted returns for the industry, can the Minister give an assurance that the wool tax rebate of 3.5 per cent will not be abolished during these hard and difficult times?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool tax rebate is a mechanism of distributing surplus Australian Wool Realisation Commission (AWRC) funds that are not prudently required for debt management purposes. In calculating the amount of any surplus towards the end of each financial year, the AWRC considers several factors including the market outlook for the following year, the level of debt compared to the balances specified in the debt reduction schedule, and AWRC's performance to date in the particular financial year. Under the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, the AWRC then advises the Minister of the amount of surplus funds (if any) and the Minister, following consultations with the Wool Council of Australia, the Treasurer and Minister for Finance, then determines how any surplus is distributed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 3.5 per cent rebate of wool tax for the 1992-93 wool selling season distributed the AWRC's surplus funds derived from its better than expected performance in 1991-92. For the 1993-94 season, I announced on 28 April that the Government considered there was no capacity to continue to provide a rebate beyond 30 June 1994, but in view of the current economic circumstances facing the industry, the total rate of the wool tax would be reduced to 8.5 per cent. This means that, subject to the normal statutory consultation process, the return to the prescribed level of tax will be postponed for one year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to avoid a situation in which the AWRC would be forced to sell wool from the stockpile into the depressed market in order to meet its debt repayment schedule (with negative impacts on woolgrowers' incomes), the Government has also decided to extend the repayment schedule by one year to eight years from 1991 and to introduce greater flexibility to the schedule, including the removal of the requirement for the Commission to repay any debt beyond the funds it currently holds for that purpose.  In future the annual targets for</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">repayment will be indicative, with actual targets to be determined by the Government each year according to market conditions.</PARA>
