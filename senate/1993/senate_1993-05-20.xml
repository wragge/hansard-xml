<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning we are debating cognately two taxation Bills: the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 2. Yesterday my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Short outlined the main points of the Bills. I intend to go through these Bills and address what I believe are the good points. I will also raise some of the concerns I have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, once again, the Government is just tinkering at the edges of the Australian taxation laws rather than getting around to finally doing a complete rewrite on them. If I have time towards the end of my delivery, I will mention a couple of comments of former Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs, in this morning's press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point&mdash;I congratulate the Tax Office for fixing this up&mdash;is the capital gains tax amendment whereby property installed on crown leases is depreciable. Crown leases all around Australia have always been a problem not only with the depreciating of property, plant and installations but also with various other things. A lot of those concerns will be taken away by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment seeks to amend capital gains tax provisions so that disposal of interest in plant erected on crown leases is treated consistently with the depreciation lease provisions. In other words, the build-up of interest will be treated in exactly the same way; depreciation will be treated on the same basis as are capital gains. The amendment seeks to prevent capital gains and losses from accruing in respect of plant installed on crown leases after the lease has terminated. This is to enable taxpayers to obtain depreciation for plant installed on crown leases. This is rather messy. I know for sure that plant has been depreciated on certain leases before, let alone crown leases, but the area has always remained grey for as long as I can remember. This amendment at least should put it into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, any land on which there was depreciable plant had to be owned by the entity that was claiming the depreciation, whereas we could never say that that was the case with a crown lease. Notable industries that will be affected are the mining industry, probably the biggest user of crown leases; the pastoral industry; some primary industries; and small businesses in cases where they lease land. The sort of land that they lease in Western Australia that comes to mind is former railway land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another provision deals with accrued leave. I welcome this amendment because under the present situation a deduction for accrued leave is not available unless it is actually paid out to the employee who is eligible for accrued leave. Of course, it then can be paid out only in the case of retirement, death or whatever. There are a lot of businesses sold on a walk in, walk out basis where a new owner takes everything over lock, stock and barrel and also takes on the employees who worked for the old employer. That part of the takeover or selling price of the business that took into account accrued leave was not then a deduction from the income of the person buying the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new provision, that part of the purchase price will be deductible&mdash;and so it should be, too. In the former situation, if the previous owner paid the employees out, and they did not want early payment&mdash;for various reasons they may not have been ready to retire&mdash;perhaps they would then have spent the money. So it is better for everybody all round, and the employers, the unions and the employees themselves all welcome it. I welcome the measure and I believe it is a victory for commonsense at last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The March or February statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) referred to depreciation schedule broadbanding, and the figures for depreciation were brought back to virtually half. The new depreciation figures were 33 1/3  20, 15, 10, 7 1/2, 5 and 2 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the rate applying to a person then lay between the figures, the taxpayer had the right&mdash;and still has the right&mdash;to go to the next highest figure. Unfortunately, the legislation was not written properly&mdash;which happens quite often in the federal sphere, especially in the House of Representatives where there is virtually no scrutiny of Bills because of the guillotine and the limited time available for debate&mdash;and the provision was not very definite. So taxpayers are able to slip up to the next band, even if they were on the 20 per cent band, simply because of the way the legislation has been written. I do welcome that measure because it makes very definite where a taxpayer stands in relation to depreciation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I would like to address is the definition affecting PAYE provisions in this Bill. The purpose of this amendment is to require PAYE provisions to cover training allowances payable under the landcare environmental programs. It also extends the definition affecting remuneration allowances provisions to cover members of local government bodies. This worries me a little because the whole elected council has to agree to bring the payments received by local government councillors into the provisions of PAYE. Councillors are almost like members of parliament; some are virtually full-time and they receive a fairly high remuneration. There are problems if there are no PAYE deductions, because towards the end of the year the councillors receive a large bill which causes quite a blimp in their cash flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course I presume that, where local government councillors do get high remuneration and there are no PAYE deductions, they would come under the provisional tax provisions. I am not fully aware whether that has been the case but, for instance, if councillors were paid anywhere near what members of parliament are paid&mdash;and that is not very high, I can tell you; everyone knows that&mdash;I presume they would come under the provisional tax provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) to advise in due course the implications for fringe benefits tax. In an employer-employee relationship PAYE provisions apply. From my past experience as a councillor, there were rulings from the Taxation Office to the effect that no employer-employee relationship existed between a council and its councillors. But once an employee becomes eligible to contribute PAYE deductions, then I presume that fringe benefits tax will apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does that mean then&mdash;as I am sure it will mean&mdash;that the meals provided at council meetings will come under the provisions of FBT?  I refer to the odd drink that hard working councillors have after a meeting&mdash;not towards the end of the meeting. The council that I belonged to was not one of those that opened the bar at lunchtime or afternoon teatime or anything like that. But hard working councillors are entitled to an odd drink towards the end of the day, so I presume that that will come under FBT, as will the odd end of the year function that councils have at which a few cigarettes are smoked. I presume that those things will come under FBT. In due course I would like the Minister to address the matter of the allowance that a councillor is paid, as well as a few other matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To be fair to the Government, there is a provision to undo the PAYE connection with local government, should that be desired. However, the provisions require that there must be a full council decision to that effect. Once a full council decision has been made to introduce PAYE conditions, then that decision would be very hard to undo. I am not worried about the PAYE provisions if councillors are fairly highly paid. In my own local government experience, I used to get the princely sum of $3.32 per meeting to travel from the furthest distance of my constituency, which was about two kilometres from the council chambers. But for the ones who receive a high remuneration, I believe that it is a good measure. My concern is how far the FBT provisions will extend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another welcome provision in this legislation allows an employee to apply to the commissioner for a special rate of deduction where the employee has more than one employer. This has been a sore point for a very long time for these employees. It may be the case that an employee works during the week and does part-time work over the weekend. This applies in the shearing industry to those who press wool or shear sheep&mdash;although the ones who shear sheep make enough during the week and they do not need it, but shedhands and others do work over the weekend. Of course, they have not been able to sign a rebate form because they have already lodged one with their employer during the week and then, of course, for any extra work that is done they are taxed at the highest rate. At the end of the day, after having all that tax taken out, they would say, `God'&mdash;I am a believer, so I will not say that. After having all that tax taken out, they say, `This job doesn't pay very much. I don't think I'll come next week'. I welcome that aspect of the legislation. I think once again it is a victory for commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now address capital gains tax and make clear what will happen now when a statutory licence is cancelled. No capital gains tax will be paid where a statutory licence, be it a taxi licence, a fishing licence or whatever, is cancelled for one reason or another. The way in which the tax was applied previously, on the market value at the time, was totally unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a good capital gains tax rollover measure for transfer of assets between company groups. For instance, when an asset is passed between four related companies, from company A to B to C to D, the capital gains tax will apply only to the last transaction. No capital gains tax will be paid on the transactions in between. I welcome and applaud that measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move on to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the provisions relating to exemptions from fringe benefits tax for child care and to priority of access. Senator Kernot addressed this issue very well yesterday, so I will not go into it at this stage. I have only a limited knowledge of child-care issues as I am one of those who believe that child care should take place in the home, as happened in my time; but I will not get into that argument at this time, Madam Acting Deputy President. I do welcome that measure for those affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time that I have to speak, I would now like to draw attention to the reduction of company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Both Senator Watson and I commented on this at the time of the announcement by the Prime Minister. We hammered the press to raise the point that this is not as glossy as it seems on the surface, but the press did not take it up. When one goes into this further, the problems really emerge. However, I do believe that the reduction of company tax from 39 per cent to 33 per cent is a big advantage to companies to enable them to reinvest in and expand their companies. They can employ more people and buy more plant, with a build-up of the economy around a company. As far as that goes, it is good. Then the profits of the company are distributed. If a person is on a tax rate of 48c in the dollar, the Government will be collecting more tax. I know that the taxation authorities, in the explanatory memorandum, have admitted&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as Senator Watson says, it is certainly an advantage to foreigners. But I do not believe in scaring off foreign investment in Australia. This measure will involve a clawback in taxation collection and in the long term I believe as much or more tax will be collected. So to a certain extent I believe it was an election gimmick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Minister addresses the chamber, I would like him to tell us when division 7, which provided that all companies had to distribute a certain percentage of their after tax profits, is to be re-implemented. If it is re-implemented, the Government will certainly be collecting a lot more tax. I would like the Minister to tell us about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up on the comment that my colleague Senator Panizza just made concerning those remarks by Sir Harry Gibbs. I think it has become quite well known that the complexity and the uncertainty within the taxation law make the law uncertain as a whole and, therefore, we are effectively reducing the major principle of the rule of law. I think it is not without significance that in looking at the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, which are before us, we find that the second Bill has 58 pages and the explanatory memorandum has 116 pages. Continually we are enacting legislation which means that there is more confusion in the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the question of reducing the corporate rate, at the outset I think we can say it is a pea and thimble trick. It is proposed by the Government as bringing down a universal benefit on all people who are subject to paying corporate tax. In fact, that is just not the case. Some people will be worse off; some people will be better off. But at the end of the day what offends me most is a point that was raised by my colleague Senator Watson yesterday, which deals with the fact that what we are doing is giving an advantage to foreign companies. When we put this legislation together with the double tax agreements we see that if an Australian company becomes the subject of a takeover bid, and another Australian company wants to use its investing powers to take over that company in competition with a foreign company with foreign investment, the foreign investors have an advantage because the returns that will flow to them make it more attractive for the foreign investors to be able to bid more for that company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been touted&mdash;first during the election period and now that it has been brought into the Parliament&mdash;as supposedly being of benefit to Australians. I think others of my colleagues have made the point that because of the manner of the collection of the taxation we will literally get to the stage where Australian residents can be paying more tax but foreign investors are paying less. That is not my idea of making laws for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disparity between the top rate of personal tax and the reduced rate of corporate tax again raises the question of whether or not it becomes attractive for people to incorporate and use the lower rate. In a press release put out by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia the point is made that many small business people looking forward to the promised tax cut in company rates from the present 39 per cent to 33 per cent for the 1993-94 tax year will be disappointed because under current Tax Office practice they will end up distributing the after tax profits after dividend imputation at full individual marginal tax rates. According to the New South Wales chairman of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the general anti-tax avoidance rules prevent individual taxpayers alienating income from personal exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, a further element of confusion is put into the tax system. The Government purports to say that it is passing laws in the interest of Australian citizens; it purports to say that there are universal benefits being bestowed when there are not; and we see this downright un-Australian advantage being given to foreign investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the disparity between the top marginal rate and the corporate rate, there is a general expectation that some people will seek to incorporate. Business has queried whether the Government might not consider the reactivation of the old division 7, at least in relation to private companies that do not earn the majority of their income from active businesses. A significant report from the Economic Planning Advisory Council suggests that the reduction of the company tax rate will only deliver marginal benefit to local firms. The reduction will mean that Australia will become one of the cheapest countries in the developed world for foreigners to invest in, which is the point that I made earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that the promised six per cent cut to the company tax rate would reduce the final tax cost to foreigners for new investments in Australia by 5.2 percentage points to 28.1 per cent.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lower company rate will only reduce the real tax costs to local investors by 1.5 percentage points to 31.8 per cent. In other words, the Government's own advisory council has spelt out the point that I made: that the Government is giving advantage to people who are not Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the area of finance, tax and debt that the question of our independence as a nation is really relevant. By the year 2000 we will have an international debt of around $400 billion, largely because of the tax policy that this Government has pursued for the last 10 years. Because just over 60 per cent of all federal taxation revenue collected is personal income tax, we have seen a downgrading and a lessening of Australian savings. At the end of the day there are no savings against which Australian companies or individuals can borrow in order to expand or build new businesses. The result has been that we have had to go overseas to borrow other people's savings&mdash;hence the debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If in our personal circumstances we had a huge debt on our house or business and we were not earning enough to meet the monthly repayments, we know what would happen to us: in would come the bailiff, we would be sold up, and down would go our standard of living. The situation is not much different for countries. We have an international debt and we are not earning enough to meet the monthly repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the balance of payment figures each month, we will see that the one consistent area where we continue to go into debt is the payments we have to make to service our international debt&mdash;somewhere between $1 billion and $1.4 billion a month. It is not our imports and exports that cause us great hardship. Over a 12-month period we export about as much as we import. We build that foreign debt every month because of the interest and dividend payments that we are obliged to make every month. On average, we are paying somewhere around 7.1 per cent on the money we are borrowing. Even the most optimistic figures published by the Government indicate that, of that gross international debt figure of $200 billion, about $86 billion is government sector debt on current figures. That is the debt racked up by State and Federal governments and their agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation cannot go on. Here again, we are not attacking the problem of how to create indigenous savings or how we are to encourage ordinary Australian taxpayers to invest their money. Ordinary Australian taxpayers who have invested in shares with an imputed dividend of 39c will have their income lessened again. Again, it will not be an attractive form of savings or investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At every turn the Government seems to ignore the fact that our debt is getting greater and greater and hanging over our heads as a threat to our independence. I said that if it were in our personal circumstances it would be the bailiff who would come in. In other countries it is not the bailiff who comes in, it is the International Monetary Fund&mdash;it has already made a strong visit to Canada. If the International Monetary Fund decides that it is necessary to reschedule our debts, or take action with regard to Australia, it will simply say, `We will do it, but in turn you will have to put in place the following policies'. Then our standard of living goes down and our independence as a nation goes with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be an independent Australian nation we have to be in a position to make decisions for us and by us so that we control our own destiny. My colleagues, such as Senator Kemp, have raised the question of the way that the Government is using the external affairs power to make more and more Australian decisions subject to review by international bodies which are constituted by persons unknown to the Australian people, and certainly over whom we have no control. More and more this Government is exposing us to the likelihood of an intervention by the International Monetary Fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to tackle the debt problem. We must have policies to increase savings by ordinary Australians. Unless we start to create that indigenous capital, unless we lessen the burden on ordinary Australians so that they are encouraged to save, we are putting our independence as a nation at risk. In this legislation&mdash;complicated by the explanatory memorandum having to be twice the size of the enacting legislation&mdash;we see foreign investors being advantaged over Australians. That is not my definition of a government that is governing in the interests of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we discuss the question of what it means to be Australian, we should start to look at the pea and thimble tricks that the Government tends to pull on the Australian people. We are dealing in areas of complexity. It is not good enough for a government which was elected on a scare campaign to turn round now, break its promises and try to implement ways and means of wrenching more money by way of taxation out of ordinary Australians to pay for the folly of its policies in the last 10 years. Debt is our major problem. Encouraging Australians to create indigenous savings so that we can again be independent and prosperous is the task that all of us have to address. </PARA>

To the extent they were saying that this is not a cure for all ills, of course they were right. It is a beneficial move. Senator Panizza acknowledged that and expressed some support for it, but he also had some reservations about it. I do not want to oversell it and make people think that just by reducing company tax a magic wand appears and all sorts of economic ills disappear. That is not the case. But it is an economically beneficial move because it creates for some companies operating in Australia&mdash;depending on their profit and investment plans and other business situations&mdash;the opportunity to undertake new investment and to create more jobs. For that reason this change has been broadly welcomed. It would be inappropriate to oversell it, but I do not think the Government has tried to do that. This is part of a package of measures. More is needed. I suppose it is, in the conventional way of expressing things, necessary but not sufficient for solving all our economic ills.

I want to reiterate the Minister's remarks although, given that he is the responsible Minister and I am not, I really do not need to do that. At the end of the debate there was an attempt by someone to re-run her leadership credentials by reading a speech she did not understand. We were struck by an interconnected series of assertions; some of which made sense when taken in isolation, but when interconnected they made none. Then there were allegations that we were about to have the IMF knocking on our door. There have been various attempts to run that furphy for a while.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a disturbing attempt to imply that in some way these changes will be relatively adverse to the circumstance of Australian business. This was linked to questions about takeovers. The outcome relating to takeovers will depend on a whole range of factors. For example, an Australian company may distribute only part of its profits to shareholders. Where profits are retained for reinvestment, the tax rate on those profits will operate at this company tax level, and the marginal tax rate in the foreign country from which the company comes is, of course, also an independent factor in this. It is true that if a company has its origin in a country with lower taxes than ours, at the end of the day it pays lower taxes. As the corollary applies&mdash;particularly as a result of these changes&mdash;a company which has its headquarters in, and operates out of, a country with a higher tax base pays higher taxes. If that is the sum total of the point&mdash;which is very profound&mdash;it is true. But I do not want to pursue that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset, in handling the Telecommunications Amendment Bill on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, that the Opposition will be supporting the passage of the legislation. The Opposition does not have any major objections to this Bill; in fact, we would welcome any Bill which, however slightly, seeks to extend and ensure competition within the telecommunications industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will extend to the three mobile telephone carriers&mdash;Telstra Corporation Ltd, Optus Mobile Pty Ltd and Vodafone Pty Ltd&mdash;the benefit of land access; that is, the ability to enter privately owned land in order to inspect, evaluate or construct telecommunications facilities for the provision of general telecommunications services. In short, this is a Bill which, if passed, we hope will strengthen and provide for true competition in the telecommunications area, an initiative which is very long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, these three general carriers of mobile phone services have restricted powers under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to enter privately owned land in order to inspect, evaluate, and to install or construct telecommunications facilities for the provision of general services. The Telecommunications Amendment Act 1993 seeks to redress that situation in that it will provide mobile carriers with the same statutory land access rights as are currently applied to the general carrier; that is, Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Government to claim, however, that this Bill will support, in principle at least, a fairer and more competitive environment is a somewhat optimistic view, given the humbug which has been going on for almost all of this year with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), the Government and the department with regard to the pay television fiasco, and given the embarrassing situation in which the Minister has found himself in this place in recent weeks. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister interjects, `What has that got to do with this issue?'. It has got a lot to do with the issue of competition, because among the problems that have arisen in the pay television fiasco is the determination on the part of this Government to restrict the degree of competition on pay television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition within the industry has hardly been the focus of the Government's telecommunications reform, as the Opposition has long witnessed. It is hardly a word that even exists in the Government's vocabulary when it comes to the real implementation of policy. This Government only discovered the word `competition' in recent times and is still trying to come to terms with its real meaning in terms of actually applying it in practical policy terms. It seems that under this Government telecommunications policy appears to be about inadequate departmental advice, interference, meddling and ministerial bungling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before us, however, does seek to provide Austel with the power to issue directions to carriers about compliance with the new obligations under the land access code, which will provide for procedures which must be followed by carriers relating to land, owners of land and occupiers of land. It will set down procedures for consultation between land owners, land occupiers and carriers in the event of a dispute or disagreement about a carrier exercising its land access powers. It will set up procedures for consultation between carriers to share facilities when new facilities are proposed in the vicinity of existing facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the intention of this Bill to safeguard the interests of property owners by introducing a land access code under which Austel may deal with any contravention. At least now, carriers who contravene directions will be subject to a strict enforcement regime. In past years Telecom as the sole carrier had unquestionably broad access rights over land access under the Act, and it is not unreasonable that the Government should be redressing them, reining them back somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carte blanche in this respect is no longer the preserve of Telecom, and the newer players in the industry will operate under identical arrangements. The Australian Telecommunications Authority will be provided with the power to issue written directions to carriers about how they are to comply with the land access code and to ensure that such directions are enforceable. Indeed, the obligations require the giving of reasonable written notice to the owner of the land and, in certain cases, to the owner and occupier of the land on which the carrier is intending to exercise its powers. This is timely because, in the past, arrangements between the carrier and the landowners or occupiers were somewhat different. In past years, although complaints concerning Telecom's access rights have been very few, the rights of land-holders or occupiers were virtually non-existent. Now landowners and occupiers will have much greater rights, and the restrictions will now be placed on carriers to meet these requirements when installations are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, if they were unhappy about Telecom activities, there was technically very little that land-holders could do. If they had genuine problems regarding, say, trees being pulled down, the installation of cables underground which may disturb their crops, or even with the ripping up of their land, they had very little leverage with which to negotiate. Understandably, that will now change with the passage of this legislation and the rights of landowners will therefore be re-established. As the Opposition therefore has no objections to this legislation, we support its passage through the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in the Fightback document&mdash;as outrageous. In other words, to hell with the interests of our own carriers, let us give away these extraordinarily valuable rights to the carriers from everywhere else and not protect the rights of our own Australian carriers. This scorched earth stuff is Opposition policy. The Opposition has the same policy with regard to telecommunications: let her rip. The problem about letting her rip in telecommunications, as far as I am concerned, is that the real result would be not more competition but less. The policy of the Government, effectively supported by the Department of Transport and Communications, is not scorched earth, the devil take the hindmost and the market rules&mdash;and properly so. To establish a mobile phone network takes an enormous amount of capital. We have to expend a very large amount of money&mdash;like pay television&mdash;before we get a dollar back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view&mdash;and I do not apologise for saying this&mdash;the competition which this Government with its sound policies is introducing into telecommunications has to be carefully managed. It is not a case of let her rip. We could get into the situation in which, if open slather were allowed in telecommunications rather than the careful approach that we are taking, the financial viability of the operators that are now effectively providing competition to Telecom could be undermined to such an extent that the final result could be less consumer benefit, not more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the telecommunications and broadcasting industry was telling me for most of last year&mdash;and at the last ATUG conference that I went to this was said to me again and again during the evening&mdash;was, `We support fully the Government's changes in telecommunications. We support the establishment of the Spectrum Management Agency to handle the management of spectrum'. This all happened last year at the Australian Broadcasting Authority. Of course, those two agencies will manage all future tender processes for radio spectrum sales and broadcasting licences. Members of the industry also said, `We support the competition which has now been effectively provided to Telecom by Optus, and now by Vodafone in the mobile market. We support all of that'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very commendable record of public policy, but it is enough now. I have said publicly several times that I agree with that view. What the industry was telling me for six months last year was, `Look, we now need a period of consolidation in the communications side of this portfolio. We need a period in which industry can adjust to all these massive changes'. During this period the broadcasting industry can get used to dealing with the new ABA and the new broadcasting Act; all of these other agencies can find their feet, and Optus and Telecom and, eventually, Vodaphone can effectively work out their roles. Of course, that is currently happening and, I am pleased to say, getting a lot of public attention in respect of Optus and Telecom balloting for phone services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to assert that it is managed change, not the `let her rip' approach that the Opposition has consistently advocated for a long time, that is the policy of the Government, and it is being effectively delivered by the Department of Transport and Communications.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to decrease the excise duty payable on gasoline for use in aircraft, or avgas, and to increase the excise duty payable on tobacco and tobacco products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Avgas</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed decreases in avgas occur in two stages. The first is effective from 7 May 1992 and the second decrease is effective from 19 August 1992. The decreases result from two sources. The first is from the Government's policy of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the aerodrome local ownership plan to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. The second is from a reduction in Civil Aviation Authority costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resulting reduction in funding is then passed on to the aviation industry in the form of decreases in the rate of excise duty to be paid on the avgas. This Bill proposes a total decrease of 2.1 cents per litre. A decrease of two cents per litre is attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program. The other 0.1 cents per litre is attributable to the CAA achieving cost savings in the provision of its rescue and firefighting services. These cost savings result in a corresponding reduction to the proportion of excise duty used to fund that service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tobacco</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed increase in excise duty on tobacco products amounts to $5.00 per kilogram. The Government is concerned about the social costs of smoking. However, it realises a balance must be struck with this concern and placing an unfair burden on tobacco users which may also have an undesirable inflationary impact. The Government considers that the proposed increase is a responsible measure which adequately satisfies this balance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the decrease in the duty payable on avgas and the increase in duty payable on tobacco took effect last year pursuant to Excise Tariff Proposals Nos. 1 and 2 of 1992. These proposals lapsed upon the dissolution of the House on 8 February this year and then their effect was reinstated by Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1993. Notwithstanding their lapsing, duty collections continued at the rates specified in the proposals and therefore this Bill proposes to validate those collections as well as incorporating Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 of 1993 into the Excise Tariff Act 1921.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gasoline for use in aircraft</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction of 2 cents per litre in respect of the Department of Transport and Communication's aerodrome cost recovery program will result in a reduction of revenue in the order of $1.8 million in 1992-93 and $2 million in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decrease of 0.1 cents per litre requested by the Civil Aviation Authority is balanced by the reductions in moneys appropriated to it, so therefore there will be no net financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tobacco Products</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the excise duty on tobacco products, together with the corresponding increase in the Customs duty, was estimated as part of the 1992 Budget to result in an increase of $80 million for 1992-93 and $100 million for 1993-94.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I indicate at the outset that as with the previous Bill, which dealt with a different subject, the Opposition will be supporting the passage of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1993. The Bill amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and seeks to validate duty collections pursuant to excise tariff proposals which lapsed following the dissolution of the Parliament earlier this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excise tariff proposals I have just mentioned provide for a reduction in excise duty on gasoline used in aircraft&mdash;that is, avgas&mdash;as well as an increase in the excise duty on tobacco and its products. In respect of avgas, it has already occurred in two stages with the blessing of this enabling legislation. The first stage was effective from 7 May 1992 and the second from 19 August 1992. As a result, the price of avgas falls by a total of 2.1c per litre. But not unlike petrol, as motorists would know, the cost of avgas varies according to location. For instance, in Canberra it is currently available at 89.9c a litre, which includes a 5c freight charge. In my home city of Adelaide it is available for about 84c a litre. Overall, the excise still represents about 30 per cent of the cost of a litre of avgas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992, the excise was reduced by about 1.02c per litre, from 26.4c per litre to 25.38c per litre. The reduction in excise has occurred because of the Government's promise&mdash;one of the few promises the Government has made that it is going to keep&mdash;to reduce excise duty, as the cost of providing the services to aircraft funded by that particular duty also falls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total reduction has come about because of the 1990 transfer of federally owned aerodromes to full local ownership, and the encouragement of aerodrome owners receiving federal funding to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. So the Government is no longer responsible for the cost of maintaining and administering those aerodromes. It is also the result of savings achieved by the Civil Aviation Authority, following the removal of rescue and fire fighting services from secondary capital city airports. This move was supported both by the industry and by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the increase in the excise on tobacco and tobacco products announced in the 1992 Budget, it is intended to address, in part at least, some of the social costs to the community of people's smoking. The excise increase will be $5 per kilogram, increasing the price from $52.50 to $57.50 per kilogram. Concerned though any government ought to be regarding the social costs of smoking, an unfair burden should not be placed on smokers by inappropriately inflating the cost of such products. Both these excise duties&mdash;that is, on avgas and tobacco&mdash;as I understand it, took effect last year pursuant to excise tariff proposals Nos 1 and 2 of 1992. Notwithstanding the lapse, collection of duties continued at the rate specified earlier. Hence, this Bill proposes the validation of those collections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, as far as light aircraft operators are concerned, what this Labor Government giveth with one hand it taketh away with the other. Unfortunately, the savings they will gain through reduced excise will be more than offset by the additional cost to general aviation engendered by the Government's proposed new airspace management system. Even more importantly, the new airspace system announced recently with great fanfare by the Civil Aviation Authority is fundamentally flawed and potentially dangerous. It is like no other system in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original plan, introduced by John Wright and his AMATS team, had the desirable aim of harmonising Australian airspace with the rest of the world, as well as reducing costs and allowing Australians to purchase proven air traffic control equipment. An</PARA>
<PARA>outline of this plan was published in a Civil Aviation Authority publication, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Improving the Management of Australian Airspace</EMPHASIS>. The airspace system that the Civil Aviation Authority plans to introduce in Australia contains unique features which have never been tested anywhere else in the world and which are potentially dangerous.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Civil Aviation Authority board members do not appear to appreciate the high risk that they are allowing to be inflicted upon Australian aviation&mdash;a situation for which the board, the Department of Transport and Communications and the accident-prone Minister for Transport and Communications (Senate Collins) will have to accept responsibility.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has got a lot to do with the excise Bill. I made the point that on the one hand the Government is reducing some of the costs for general aviation but, on the other hand, as a result of these measures, it is going to increase them. That is why it has a lot to do with this particular Bill. When the Minister interrupted, I was referring to the diagrams and comparison charts shown in the Civil Aviation Authority booklet.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister and I thank the Senate. If we look at the charts, it is clear that the original proposals put up for airspace had only minor differences, such as cloud separation requirements, from the International Civil Aviation Organisation's recommendations. Those proposals resulted in a simple, easy to learn, system. However, under the system now proposed by the Civil Aviation Authority the differences are major. These include unique and complicated radio procedures for visual flight rule aircraft in class E and class G airspace, thus negating the only reason for these classifications of International Civil Aviation Organisation airspace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more differences. First and most important, in the original plan an ATC service was to be provided to all instrument flight rule aircraft to ground level where traffic levels were high but would not justify a control tower. This is the system in both the United States and Canada, and the airspace is called class E. It is transparent to visual flight rule traffic and it is not as costly as the existing high level controllers providing the service, as the diagram shows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new proposals this air traffic control service will stop at 5,000 feet in radar airspace and 10,000 feet in all other airspace, which covers about 80 per cent of Australian airspace. No other country in the world has such a system. The Civil Aviation Authority has invented a mandatory traffic advisory frequency procedure in an attempt to compensate for the lowering of safety. Unfortunately, this is an unproven system and completely at odds with the existing mandatory traffic advisory frequency where all instrument flight rule traffic is provided with flight service traffic information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unique mandatory traffic advisory frequency procedure will be complicated and totally different to that applying in any country in the world, and effectively negates the whole reason for changing the airspace, which was to be harmonisation with best world practice. Australian pilots flying overseas and overseas pilots flying here will have to learn and adapt to totally different procedures. More importantly, the advanced Australian air traffic system equipment will now have to be designed for the unique Australian airspace system, resulting in potential huge cost blow-outs and delays in commissioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major difference is the mandatory transponder or radio requirement for aircraft above 5,000 feet in en route radar space. This is not an International Civil Aviation Organisation recommendation, and again no other country in the world has shown it can afford such a restrictive and expensive requirement. In the United States, that requirement is now 10,000 feet; in Canada it is 12 1/2 thousand feet. This unique Australian requirement will cost up to $6 million and only affects general aviation aircraft, as airline aircraft already have transponders. As I said earlier, what the Government gives in one hand in reducing this avgas excise, it is taking away with the other with the additional costs it is imposing on light aircraft operators. If radio is used instead of a transponder, the cost will be even higher as air traffic control sectors will have to be smaller and visual flight rule aircraft will have to be charged for the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No objective cost benefit study has been done for this transponder requirement, even though a comprehensive cost-benefit study has been done for closing down control towers, which, by strange coincidence, represents a cost saving to airline aircraft. Avgas powered aircraft pay the same whether there is a tower there or not&mdash;an across-the-board excise, as a result of this legislation, of a bit more than 25c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some thought must be given to what this system would do to air traffic controllers who are, of course, a very professional group. They are losing responsibility for providing safety services to passenger carrying airline aircraft that need and can afford an air traffic control system while they will be given extra responsibilities for large numbers of visual flight rule aircraft operating above 5,000 feet without a transponder. Even flight service no longer provides a service for these aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system will place professional air traffic controllers in an almost impossible position, as they are to be given responsibility and therefore duty of care for visual flight rule aircraft, including gliders in class E airspace, without the internationally proven protection of the class D airspace procedures. One has to seriously question why we even bothered to move to the International Civil Aviation Organisation's separated instrument flight rule and visual flight rule cruising levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total injustice of this system is obvious. The airlines claim that, because they pay over 80 per cent of the Civil Aviation Authority's income, they should have most of the say. They have used this clout to bring in procedures which reduce safety to airline passengers but save the airlines many millions of dollars, while forcing additional and onerous requirements and costs on general aviation. However, in the long run, the airlines will probably end up with less safety and higher costs as they will no longer have a thriving general aviation industry from which they can draw a pool of experienced pilots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board of the Civil Aviation Authority has failed to obtain independent, professional advice on these issues&mdash;for example, by speaking to North American experts&mdash;before making a final board decision on airspace design. Instead, it has accepted the recommendations of the Civil Aviation Authority management. Apparently, Civil Aviation Authority management regards the proposals as not a significant departure from internationally accepted practice. But no country in the world, including Australia, has ever put in place the proposed system of airline traffic, operating into airports such as at Yulara or Cooma, without a traffic separation or information service being provided on other instrument flight rule aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority management has wrongly claimed that this is the practice in Canada. That is clearly not the case, as Canada has yet to move to International Civil Aviation Organisation airspace. However, in its current airspace, which is similar to our proposed class G, airline traffic is provided with a traffic information service from remote VHF outlets and local flight service stations on frequency 126.7. This is completely different from what is being introduced in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority has also wrongly claimed that Canada has a similar system to our mandatory traffic advisory frequency. That is also not the case, as the Canadian system of mandatory frequency has a fundamental difference. It only has a mandatory radio requirement where there is a ground station with which to communicate. The reason a ground station must be present for mandatory frequency requirements is for fundamental safety reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Civil Aviation Authority management claims that the North American system of class E airspace would cost up to $30 million per annum to implement in Australia. That is completely unjustified and incorrect as a claim, and shows a clear lack of understanding of the criteria used in the North American system. These criteria are based on objective traffic densities and risk modelling. If the same criteria were used in Australia it would mean only class E airspace to ground level at a small number of busy airports with airline traffic but with insufficient traffic density to justify a control tower. This is, of course, as was originally planned by John Wright's team. There would be a cost, but this could be fully justified under the application of objective safety criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the proposed potentially dangerous system, airline traffic will be largely on its own below 5,000 feet in radar airspace and below 10,000 feet in other airspace. This means that large aircraft such 737s going into Yulara or the F28 jets that fly into Cooma&mdash;we need to remember that Cooma can be subject to bad weather conditions&mdash;will not be provided with traffic or separation services on all other instrument flight rule traffic. This is totally unacceptable, and it is unfortunate that we will probably have to wait for a serious incident or accident before the merit of fully adopting the proven international system is driven home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not imagine that work force airline pilots and air traffic controllers are happy with the new proposals. It is my understanding that a number of the chief pilots of major regional airlines and a wide range of air traffic controllers are opposed to the proposed system which has now been accepted by the Civil Aviation Authority and which, as I understand it, is hurriedly being put in place for November of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the original John Wright plan the International Civil Aviation Organisation airspace was not to have been introduced until July 1994. The Civil Aviation Authority claims to have industry support for its new airspace system. This may appear to be the case only because the Civil Aviation Authority has convinced industry that the proposed system is based on proven international practice. As I have just indicated, that is clearly not the case. Senior air traffic controllers who have been involved in the development of the airspace proposals and the chief pilots of a number of regional airlines are totally opposed to the parts of the proposals that are unique to Australia and that are as yet unproven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people in the industry do not understand the proposals and genuinely accept the Civil Aviation Authority's October 1992 aviation bulletin which stated that it was moving to the International Civil Aviation Organisation airspace classifications and harmonising with the rest of the world. In the absence of any widely circulated publicity from the CAA about its changed position, most industry people have assumed that the original proposals remain in place, but nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hardly surprising that the Civil Aviation Authority board is getting questionable advice. The team that the Civil Aviation Authority has put together for the airspace system project is made up of pilots and Civil Aviation Authority management with no training in the complex job of objective risk analysis of airspace design. Designing an airspace system is just as complex and specialised a task as designing the aircraft that use the airspace&mdash;a task that no-one would contemplate leaving to pilots. No person who has an in-depth knowledge of the North American airspace system we are moving to and of the fundamentally different culture involved has been consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the CAA has attempted to fit its old ideas and culture into the new International Civil Aviation Organisation international system. This is simply a recipe for disaster. While the original proposals appear to have been hijacked by a small group of airline people, we must get the system back on track and follow the safe, simple and proven International Civil Aviation Organisation recommended system, which is being adopted by New Zealand, the United States, Canada and Europe. I understand the CAA is already having difficulty in inventing the new procedures and is being forced into compromises. Let us hope that commonsense eventually does prevail and that we move back to the original proposals to harmonise with proven safety the international procedures so capably brought to us by John Wright and his original AMATS team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed system is fundamentally flawed and potentially dangerous. Therefore, the CAA board, the Department of Transport and Communications and the Minister are personally responsible if this system is introduced, because they have failed to obtain proper independent expert advice before accepting the proposals. Only yesterday we saw the Minister profess ignorance of all these matters in answer to a question I put to him during Senate Question Time. Again it is clear that Minister Collins is failing on too many fronts to exercise appropriate authority or control over his Department of Transport and Communications, and thereby allowing it to run its own agenda, whether that be pay television, aviation or whatever comes next. While passage should not be denied to this particular piece of legislation, the time has well and truly passed when this Minister should stand aside. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price of avgas will fall by a total of 2.1c per litre as a consequence of this Bill. The reduction in the price of avgas can be separated into two separate components. First, there is a 2c per litre reduction which is attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program. This program involves transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the aerodrome local ownership plan to accept full responsibility for their aerodromes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is a 0.1c per litre reduction due to the Civil Aviation Authority `achieving cost savings in the provision of its rescue and firefighting services' to secondary capital city airports. This has been implemented after a comprehensive consultative process which was carried out with the aviation industry, local authorities and the Federal Airports Corporation. Nevertheless, the Australian Democrats wish to ensure that the results of this cost cutting measure are monitored so that the rescue and firefighting services are not diminished at these airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Democrats wish to express concern, as Senator Chapman has, about the new airspace system which is to be introduced by the Civil Aviation Authority. Without going into the detail that Senator Chapman has put on record, the Australian Democrats would suggest to the Minister that it is appropriate to review the concerns that have been expressed by various people in the industry and put on the record in the Senate today and to respond in some detail on the concerns which have been expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the excise on tobacco and tobacco products, this will increase by $5 per kilogram under this Bill, raising the price from $52.50 to $57.50 per kilogram. This was a measure announced by the Government in its 1992 Budget and is designed to address the social costs of smoking; that is, to improve the health of the Australian community. The Australian Democrats very strongly support this measure not just as a revenue raising measure but very much as a measure to address the social costs of smoking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have a long history of attempting to decrease the use of tobacco in the community in realisation of the tremendous health costs&mdash;billions of dollars that are being borne by the whole community, quite apart from the diminishing health of individuals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have continued that campaign, and in particular I refer to Senator Robert Bell's efforts to remove the cost of tobacco from the CPI so that the additional imposts that we as a matter of policy support do not affect the inflationary effects of increases in the CPI.

The ACT Legislative Assembly has already passed parallel legislation which has been supported by Liberal colleagues in the ACT Opposition.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ultimate purpose of this legislation is to put in place the Commonwealth's legislation as a model for other States to follow, and in the meantime outstanding problems are to be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have long battled with this Government over the question of inefficiencies in the heavy transport road sector with respect to fuel and registration charges. So this legislation is at least a move in the right direction. The arrival of a consistent set of registration charges throughout all the States and Territories of Australia to overcome the flights of registration from States of ownership to States which have lower charges is a constructive point from which to move forward. The industry, as represented by the Road Transport Forum, supports the principles of this Bill and the charges in the Bill as proposed by the National Road Transport Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the industry has had effective input into this outcome. Hundreds of those involved at all levels of the industry came forward in discussions to put their strong view, and this was appreciated by the commission. The commission had a solid and dependable rapport with industry right across Australia. It is my belief that the entire process was a valuable exercise both for government and for industry groups. These measures represent much needed and long overdue reform for the heavy vehicle industry in Australia. For too long, inefficiencies with respect to road user charges have contributed to inefficiencies throughout the entire industry and throughout the entire country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation applies to the Australian Capital Territory alone. It does not affect any existing registration scheme in operation in the ACT other than to fix the charges to be collected when a vehicle covered by the Bill is registered. Registration exemptions or concessional charges will continue to be a matter for the ACT itself to determine. The charges do not include, nor does the schedule preclude, the fixing of fees for administration and other services provided by the ACT. In effect, this Bill pioneers national regulation of the road transport industry in Australia. It is but the first step in establishing necessary uniform regulation right across the country, including uniform loadings and general regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the variations which have applied to registration charges in the past, variations which of course will be removed by this legislation. For example, a six-axle semitrailer&mdash;that is, a prime mover with bogie drive and a tri-axle&mdash;is currently charged the following rates: in Queensland, $3,280; in New South Wales, $5,870 and in fact up to $8,000 in some circumstances; and in the Northern Territory, just $430. It is clearly ludicrous to have such massive variations in registration charges across this nation. Under the National Road Transport Commission proposals incorporated in this legislation a six-axle semitrailer would attract a registration charge of $4,000 anywhere in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the legislation only applies to the ACT and will require complementary legislation from all of the other States so that we have the same inspection criteria for registration of vehicles, load limits, driver times and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some controversy with regard to the introduction of these charges. That controversy was such that it was necessary for the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure&mdash;which, sadly, no longer exists in its own right as a result of this Government's determination to reduce adequate parliamentary scrutiny of issues and legislation but has been combined with the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and henceforward will be a very overworked committee&mdash;to take up a very detailed inquiry into the impact of uniform road user charges, particularly on rural and isolated areas of Australia. Of course, that inquiry confirmed what we all knew&mdash;that the road transport industry in Australia is the highest taxed industry in this country. Currently, a six-wheeler truck for each 120,000 kilometres that it travels is taxed in total at a rate of some $44,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise that a major cause of the excessive taxation on this industry is the dramatic increase in fuel excise that has occurred since this Government came to office in 1983. It has risen from 6c per litre to 26c per litre. This has taken total collection of fuel excise to some $7 billion&mdash;but, sadly, only $1.2 billion of that $7 billion goes back into road funding. That is a parlous situation for a country which is so heavily dependent on road transport for the production and distribution of its goods and for its wealth creation. When this Government came to office, about 80 per cent of fuel excise went into road funding; now it is down to something less than 25 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, all of the States, with the exception of Western Australia and New South Wales, have accepted the determination of the National Road Transport Commission for vehicles over 4 1/2 tonnes. That is a very great step forward. But the Government needs to go further. It needs to take initiatives which will reduce the costs of operation of road transport in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the election campaign we saw yet another part of the Government's dishonest attack on coalition's policies; that is, the suggestion that road transport would in fact be charged more under a coalition government, notwithstanding the fact that we had made a firm commitment to abolish fuel excise and completely get rid of that 26c a litre that is charged not only on road transport operators but on all vehicle operators, including motorists. That would have represented a substantial saving to road transport in this country. Our further commitment was that there would be no additional road user charges levied on the industry other than that being put in place by this legislation&mdash;the uniform road user charges that this Government had already introduced on the recommendation of the National Road Transport Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding those two firm commitments from the coalition, we saw a massive and dishonest scare campaign embarked upon by various Labor Party candidates in the last election. They implied that there would be a new road user charge introduced by a coalition government when we had clearly said that there would be no new road user charge in the first term of that government and that the situation would be reviewed at the end of that first term to consider the equity of the scheme that was then in place. We also heard claims made by Labor Party candidates not only that there would be additional road user charges for the road transport industry but also that private motorists would be hit by increased registration charges initiated by State governments as a result of the loss of revenue from the fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But of course the fact is that that revenue does not in any way provide the States with funds for roads. The funds provided for roads by the Commonwealth Government were fully covered in the coalition's policy package. The additional revenue which States put into roads is raised from their own sources; it would not have been affected in any way by the changes the coalition was proposing and, of course, there would not have been any increase in State registration charges as a result of the coalition's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just raise that matter to highlight again the dishonest way in which the Labor Party campaigned during the last election. It is absolutely essential that a review of the costs of these new charges be undertaken by the Federal Government, and in particular by the National Road Transport Commission, to ensure that there is equity in the impact of the charges&mdash;firstly to make sure that the road transport industry in toto does not continue to pay a much greater level of taxation than is paid by other industry sectors, and, secondly, to ensure that regional, isolated and rural areas are not paying more than their fair share of the costs of taxation on the road transport industry because of the additional cost to freight that these charges and levels of taxation cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the two areas of my concern, they are the two areas of major concern to my coalition colleagues, and it is essential that the National Road Transport Commission continue to monitor both of those areas and when the time for review of the present charges comes up, then certainly any discrepancies and unfairness ought to be removed in the next lot of road transport user charges introduced by this Government. With those remarks, I conclude and simply indicate the coalition's support for the legislation. </PARA>

That is part of our responsibility of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the total mess-up in the Minister's communications, it is part of our responsibility to seek to get to the bottom of the problem and to try to determine where there is blame. Is it properly directed at the bureaucrats, which has been the approach of the Minister to date, or is it properly directed at the Minister's staff, which seems to be the approach that he was taking yesterday? Or is it the Minister who should be properly accepting responsibility for the awful mess-up that has occurred in both these areas of satellite and microwave communication?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to get to the bottom of that. We have said to the Minister that to do so we require certain documents to be tabled.

I will be amazed if he has got the nerve to say, `I have had insufficient time to put the satellite material together', because clearly he and his department have been putting that stuff together now for weeks, and had to put it together for the purposes of the independent inquiry that he set up.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you what the original agreement was, Madam Acting Deputy President. I thought it was a reasonable one. It has been a hell of a job, quite frankly, for all of these documents to be perused and for Professor Pearce to not only examine them but also examine officers, write a report and bring it down before the Senate gets up. I undertook that I would have the document in the hands of the Senate by the 25th of this month&mdash;next Tuesday. Senator Alston knows about this. I was told by my department, on advice from Professor Pearce, that that was the tightest time in which he thought he could do a responsible job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston and I had a discussion about tabling papers, and I said to Senator Alston&mdash;although he tried to deny it yesterday&mdash;that even though I was told it was going to be difficult, I would bring forward the Pearce report a full 24 hours to next Monday. I had 10 years in opposition. If one needs more than four days to do a job, then one should hand one's pay cheque back after a fortnight. But Senator Alston did not dispute that. I said, `That will give you Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday&mdash;four full days&mdash;to examine it'. I further gave an undertaking that it would be in the House at the beginning of the sitting on Monday&mdash;not at the end of it, or the night. For all Senator Alston's prevarication and nonsense, that was the agreement and he knew it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then got a number of urgent requests&mdash;which I did not think were unreasonable, frankly. It would have been tight enough to have got the Pearce report in here on Monday, but I was asked to have it here four days ahead of when I had promised it; that is, today. I said, `All right, I'll try'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging by some comments I saw in the paper this morning, it seems to be impossible in certain quarters to get any fair and reasonable assessment of this. I refer to the little stunt Senator Alston pulled on yesterday afternoon about my alleged lack of communication with my departmental secretary. I will canvass that now, too. I had a meeting with Mr Evans in response to this request from the Australian Democrats and Senator Alston to get the Pearce report in the chamber four days ahead of when I had promised. I told the honourable senator all about this yesterday, and he knows it. I met with Mr Evans at about one o'clock yesterday afternoon and I said, `What I want you to do is to separate out your part of the report. I know you want to have it all tabled together but, sorry, you can't do it. You are going to have to table that separately. What I want you to do is go and see Professor Pearce and find out if we can get the report finished, printed and tabled in this Parliament today.' He said, `All right'. That was at one o'clock yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who actually commented on this in the newspapers I hope will listen to this, in terms of Senator Alston's little stunt yesterday afternoon. That is the undertaking that I gave and I have discharged it. Then I had the comment from Senator Alston, `Oh, well, you won't get it in till midnight then, will you, this evening?'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few words about Professor Pearce, because I can see where the focus is shifting now&mdash;and it is outrageous. Senator Alston should keep it on me. I will tell honourable senators something about Professor Pearce. I refer them to what Senator Michael Baume had to say in this chamber last week about Professor Pearce, and I will table a paper in relation to that. Senator Baume is not bad at throwing abuse, as I am, at the best of times, but Senator Baume gave one of the fairer versions. Senator Baume said&mdash;look in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that Professor Pearce is noted as the outstanding expert on administrative law in Australia. But the one concern that Senator Baume raised&mdash;and it was valid&mdash;was that he acts as a legal consultant, which he does, to a private firm which may have an interest in the contract matter. That is a serious issue, and I took it up immediately. I will table a letter to Jack Lake from the head of my department, who discussed this with Professor Pearce and pointed out the obvious. Frankly, when Senator Baume reads this letter I am sure he will accept it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Pearce said, `Yes, I do act as legal consultant to a private company but that is not relevant. There is no conflict of interest, because I am investigating'&mdash;as the report will clearly show in a minute&mdash;`a problem of a failure of process in the department which has nothing whatever to do with any commercial interests of any company'. I table this letter now. So if the one concern that Senator Baume had is removed we are left with Senator Baume's statement&mdash;and it is correct&mdash;that Professor Pearce is what everyone acknowledges him to be: one of the outstanding experts on administrative law in Australia. Senator Baume is right about that. </PARA>

It should be compulsory for all honourable senators to visit North Queensland regularly, as it is without doubt the best part of Australia.

I hope Senator Richardson might take note of what I am going to say. I see Senator Reynolds is on the speakers list to follow me today; hopefully, Senator Reynolds may make some comment on this matter as well. It relates to the Anton Breinl centre at James Cook University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned at reports that the Federal Government is about to scale back the role of the Anton Breinl Centre for Tropical Health and Medicine, which is based at James Cook University in Townsville. Some $500,000 in general funding for research into tropical disease and training of people in public health may now be withdrawn from the centre in favour of a planned expansion of facilities in Brisbane. The director of the centre has said that such a funding cutback would mean a serious down scaling in research and a 50 per cent reduction in staff numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A working party on public health development established by the Government has apparently recommended that major public health research and education facilities be limited to one per State and, further, that a national centre for international and tropical health, incorporating Aboriginal health, be established. The working party has recommended that this national centre be located in Brisbane. The recommendations largely ignored the contributions and existing facility of the Anton Breinl centre. The Anton Breinl centre's role may be greatly eroded under this proposed plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will come as no surprise to those of us from the north to learn that the working party included no-one from northern Australia. The two people on it came from the University of Queensland in Brisbane. The working party was clearly unrepresentative and has resulted in decisions which do not consider the special needs of health in northern Australia.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned at this example of the north again being ignored. The Anton Breinl centre is a very important facility which should be supported by the Government. It is at the coalface of research into some of the very important diseases in northern Australia, many of which are not understood by people outside the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this week we had the Queensland Health Minister, Mr Hayward, displaying quite incredible ignorance of how widespread and important is the terrible tropical disease, dengue fever. Meliodosis, another example, is a lethal and little understood tropical disease which, in the last proper wet season, claimed a number of lives in North and Far North Queensland. The disease is particularly savage, claiming its victims with little warning&mdash;in a matter of days. This disease, the bacteria of which reside in the soil, is most dangerous during wet weather. It is only thanks to the drought that this disease has not caused more deaths over the last two years. Ross River fever is another debilitating tropical disease which needs much more research. The Anton Breinl centre has been heavily involved in vital work on all of these diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the field of education the centre plays a very important role through its courses for over 100 graduate students in public health and tropical medicine at diploma, masters and PhD levels. I am advised by the centre that some 20 per cent of the students at the college are from Aboriginal and Islander communities, and that there is a special focus on Aboriginal health, which I think is very important. Block courses are conducted across northern Australia in Nhulunbuy in the Northern Territory and Broome in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am somewhat surprised that the Labor member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, has not lifted a finger in the last week since the prospect of funding cutbacks has been raised. I would have thought that Mr Lindsay, as the member for one of the northern seats, would, like me, be getting behind the Anton Breinl centre. In 1991, Mr Lindsay told Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unquestionably, the Anton Breinl Centre is making a significant contribution to public health education and training in Northern Australia . . . the centre has shown an outstanding ability to respond to the needs of public health education and research in North Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>So I have been very surprised that Mr Lindsay has been silent in response to the concerns expressed by the Anton Breinl centre. I understand that the Anton Breinl centre is today delivering a submission to the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, in the hope that cutbacks in funding and an erosion of the role of the centre can be averted. The submission seeks an expansion in support from the Commonwealth from 1995, when the current funding contract expires, which would include work at the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin. I know Senator Richardson has met in recent days with the director of the centre, Professor Wronski, and I would urge Senator Richardson to reconsider the recommendations of the working party, to ensure that the role of the Anton Breinl centre is expanded rather than scaled back, and to make sure that the special needs of northern Australia are not overlooked, yet again, by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will be aware, there have been many issues regarding pay TV which have been extensively canvassed in this chamber over the last two weeks or so&mdash;indeed, over the last two or three hours. I will not traverse the ground which has already been covered. However, an issue has emerged which, I believe, is of great interest to Victorians. Specifically, when all these matters are finally resolved, where will the ABC pay TV headquarters be located? This is no trivial issue; some 240 jobs are at stake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the acting Managing Director of the ABC, Mr Conroy, advised the Senate estimates committee hearing last week that it was estimated there might be 100 jobs on a pay TV news channel, and up to 140 jobs on a second channel which would be a children's channel with an arts component and a documentary component. In addition, Mr Conroy emphasised the stimulatory effect which pay TV will have and its potential for providing significant knock-on effects to other sectors of the industry. Indeed, I believe these knock-on effects will lead to a multiplier impact and will result in a very significant boost in jobs for people such as actors and producers, and production houses and industries generally affiliated with the television industry. It will provide major career opportunities for the media in Melbourne, particularly the men and women employed by the ABC who, very sensibly, prefer to live in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The location of the ABC's pay TV headquarters and production facilities is currently under consideration by the management and board of the ABC. It appears that the two locations being actively considered are Melbourne and Sydney. There is no technical reason why ABC pay TV should not be based in Melbourne. At a Senate estimates hearing, the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, perhaps reflecting the interests of the Northern Territory, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the technology available these days I am sure it&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that there is any economic reason why Sydney should be preferred to Melbourne for the location of this very important facility.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the decision that is made will touch on the more fundamental issue of whether the ABC is truly a national broadcaster or whether it is simply the Sydney broadcasting corporation masquerading as a national broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC TV budget totals some $360 million. It is collected, as honourable senators will be aware, from taxpayers all around Australia. The ABC spends some 70 per cent of this TV budget in New South Wales, yet only 34 per cent of the population of Australia live in that State. I simply do not believe that this concentration of ABC activities in one capital city can be justified. Whatever the historical reasons for concentrating activities in Sydney, modern technology has opened up the opportunity for a major decentralisation of ABC activity. It is also worth noting that the other public broadcaster&mdash;the Special Broadcasting Service&mdash;has also concentrated its activities in Sydney. Melbourne has excellent facilities and staff resources on which to base this major new ABC venture. I urge the ABC board to take this opportunity to demonstrate that the excessive concentration of ABC activity in Sydney is coming to an end. </PARA>

He was gaoled for his maltreatment of prisoners in Hungary during the Stalinist period. Honourable senators may have noted this story which first became public, to my knowledge, in an extraordinary report&mdash;which I understand is authentic&mdash;in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 27 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article tells an extraordinary story of events regarding the immigration to Australia of a person who was allegedly involved in the imprisonment, and possibly later death, of a Mr Istvan Somogyi in Hungary in the mid-1950s. Istvan Somogyi's wife&mdash;now Mrs Magda Bardy&mdash;migrated to Australia with her son in the second half of the 1950s. She and her first husband, Istvan Somogyi, had been imprisoned in Kistarcsa in 1951 during the Stalinist period by the Hungarian secret police, the AVH. Mrs Bardy served 2 1/2 years in gaol. On her release, she found that her husband had died in prison as a result of torture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the collapse of the communist regime in Hungary in 1989 Mrs Bardy has been searching Hungarian records to track the fate of her first husband. Through her investigations she has learned that the person who signed the orders for her internment and the internment of her husband probably migrated to Australia, and has been living in Sydney since 1957, just a few kilometres from where Mrs Bardy lives. She found her husband's arrest document was signed by a person called Tibor Vajda by order of the head of the secret service. His crime was that her husband `was aware of smuggling of people and goods and provided a hand in these', and his internment was `for state security reasons'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same Tibor Vajda was one of the many post-war communist hardliners who were arrested in the power struggles following Stalin's death. In January 1953 he was convicted by the military court of Budapest and sentenced to six years gaol for maltreating prisoners and preparing false statements. In October 1956 came that short-lived revolution, the surge towards freedom in Hungary, which was so ruthlessly crushed. Vajda was one of the thousands of AVH agents who fled Hungary at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through her investigations, Mrs Bardy found that the Tibor Vajda who arrested her and her husband was a dental technician who had joined the Hungarian secret police in 1946. He was a senior investigator, the leader of his party sub-branch. It was also revealed that Vajda had studied for a year in 1950 at the KGB Dzerzhinsky Academy in Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Bardy has also found that a Tibor Vajda and his family had migrated to Australia in February 1957 on an Italian ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flaminia</EMPHASIS>. She has discovered many coincidences which have led her to believe that the Tibor Vajda who has lived in Sydney for many years and practices there as a dentist is the same person who interned her husband, who tortured her in gaol, and who may possibly have been involved in the torture of her husband leading to his death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coincidences include the fact that the birth dates of both Tibor Vajda and his wife corresponded to the birth dates of Tibor and Eva Vajda as recorded in government documents from the archives of the Hungarian Government. Vajda's personal details in the New South Wales Dental Board records also matched. Information contained in Vajda's curriculum vitae, signed by him on 12 January 1952, corresponded to the general report of him being a dental technician in Hungary. From a search of his company records Mrs Bardy found that Vajda's signature corresponded with the signature on her husband's arrest papers. A forensic expert believes that the signatures were `very probably' written by the same Vajda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Bardy believes that Tibor Vajda has provided false information to the Australian Government. He claimed that he graduated from Budapest University as a dentist in July 1949. However, this is at odds with information that Mrs Bardy has received which says that the Budapest University had no record of a graduate by the name of Tibor Vajda born in 1924. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Bardy has lived in Sydney for most if not all of the period since she came to Australia in the late 1950s, and in 1984 she was awarded an Order of Australia for work in a Darlinghurst sheltered workshop. She is a constituent of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, and Dr Hewson has written to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) asking him to investigate the matters raised by Mrs Bardy following her taking it up with her local member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the points that I have made today are based on the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 27 March. As I understand it, the allegations in that report have not been refuted. On the basis of that report, the Minister has been asked to investigate the matters raised by Mrs Bardy. The representations were made to the Minister on 28 April. I hope the Minister will report urgently on this matter. In particular, I hope he will find out when Mr Vajda and his family migrated to Australia, when they were granted citizenship, and what documentation they were required to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting that in 1960 Mr Vajda made his first application to practise as a dentist in Australia and that that application was refused, although that decision was overturned the following year after intervention by his then local member of parliament. I hope that when the Minister is investigating these matters he will also report on the details of the initial refusal of the application. I also hope that the Minister will report&mdash;depending on the circumstances and the facts, of course&mdash;on whether it is within his powers to revoke the citizenship of Australians who have knowingly provided false information to the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this matter because I think it is a compelling story which shows great fortitude on the part of a woman and her son who suffered depravation in the early 1950s, and who have now been good citizens of Australia for more than 30 years. In the interests of all concerned&mdash;and not least Mr Vajda&mdash;it is a matter that requires the attention of the Minister. It is a matter that probably affects us all in some way.

That meeting passed a resolution opposing the World Heritage listing of that area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to report to the Senate&mdash;and I think it is the first time this has been reported&mdash;that the World Heritage listing of the Nullarbor will not proceed unless this Government breaks its word. The Government has promised that the listing will not proceed unless all of the governments&mdash;that is, the Western Australian Government, the South Australian Government and, of course, the Federal Government&mdash;proceed unanimously with the nomination of the Nullarbor region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Premier Richard Court, who accompanied me to the Nullarbor nearly two years ago, has a personal interest in this issue. Given Mr Court's interest, I know that the Western Australian Government will not be recommending the Nullarbor for World Heritage listing for many good reasons which I have already outlined on a number of occasions in the Senate and in other places. So the Nullarbor has been saved. The people of the Nullarbor have been saved from what I am sure are the well-intentioned plans of the Federal Government to put the Nullarbor on the World Heritage list, draw a line around those people's area and take control of their land planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disturbed when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)  made an announcement on the run during the election campaign that Lake Eyre would be the next cab off the rank for World Heritage listing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I want to make today is that World Heritage listing has become a politically contentious issue and it has become an issue that has hurt a lot of people because of the arrogance of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, of Senator Richardson before him and of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, when it comes to the process of World Heritage listing. What the process involves at the moment is either a Minister or the Prime Minister, usually in an election climate, making some commitment to look at World Heritage listing of an area. What then happens is that the locals usually get very worried about this and we then have a number of groups of people&mdash;I see Senator Ian Macdonald in the chamber; he has personal experience of what happened with the wet tropics area&mdash;with enormous uncertainty, livelihoods affected and families affected. The same thing has happened in my home State&mdash;I see Senator Panizza, the Opposition Deputy Whip, in the chamber&mdash;in Shark Bay where we had enormous uncertainty&mdash;</PARA>

Senator Tambling from the Northern Territory reminds me of Kakadu and, of course, we have the Willandra Lakes example where, after years of trying to get some sort of certainty about the management issues arising in that particular region, the people still are concerned. They have no certainty about their land tenure and it upsets the market for their properties and the pastoral leases, and the same thing is now occurring at Lake Eyre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is not that I am opposed to World Heritage listing, because I think there are many examples around the world where listing on the World Heritage register can be beneficial to the environment, can be beneficial to the economy and, indeed, can be beneficial to the people who live within the World Heritage areas. I have had the pleasure and benefit of visiting a number of World Heritage sites, both in Australia and around the world, and it is sad that the whole World Heritage listing process has been debased because of the crass use of World Heritage listing for base political purposes&mdash;mostly, in fact always, by this Labor Government, now in its fifth term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responding in part to a motion that Senator Coulter gave notice of this morning in relation to World Heritage listing, I say that it is very sad that a process that potentially could help the environment and help people is debased for political purposes. I do not want to debase the issue for political purposes myself. All I am saying is that, if we are going to be in the business of nominating areas for World Heritage listing, it is just sensible politics, it is sensible economics and it is sensible out of pure human decency and courtesy to go and talk to the people who are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World Heritage listing has become a very high profile issue which upsets people. They worry about the value of their pastoral leases, they worry about the value of their businesses and they worry about control over land use decisions moving away from their local councils, away from their State governments and to the Federal Government. I am not saying that they are all genuine concerns or matters of particular worry, but, even if the perception of the decision making power moving away from their local control and moving out of their hands is just a perception, it is dangerous, and it is important that governments consult with these local people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of this Government and the record of the previous Labor State Government in Western Australia are that consultation never took place. The Nullarbor Protection Society was not consulted at all throughout the whole process. I find that very lamentable. It would seem to me just basic commonsense to talk to the local people, get their views and persuade them if necessary. The overriding concern must be finding a sustainable way of protecting the environment and a sensible balance with the economic activity that is taking place in that particular area. I think senators all around the chamber would agree with that, and I am sure the people who are affected on the Nullarbor, the people who are affected at Willandra Lakes, the people who are affected at Shark Bay and the people who are now affected at Lake Eyre would agree with that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to sensibly look at whether drawing a boundary around an area like this and creating that uncertainty and undermining economic activity actually achieves our aim of protecting the environment, the ecosystems and the biodiversity. The answer in so many of these cases in the last 10 years is no, it does not. We need to look at how people have protected these areas already without the great benefit of having a line drawn around them and having that map sent off to the World Heritage register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But overwhelmingly, and I will conclude on this basis, if there is not consultation, if people do not take into account the interests of the local people, then World Heritage listing will continue to be used as a political football.

I probably owe Senator Campbell a slight apology, not for anything that I have said, but for something that I might have said when I first heard him when I was back in my office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having listened to him more carefully in the chamber, I can say that he seems not to be objecting to World Heritage status for this area but rather to the processes which are used, or sometimes misused, in relation to World Heritage listing. To that extent I would have to agree with him. I think it has been used on several occasions as a political football. I hope he is not disagreeing with the importance of the Lake Eyre basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like very briefly to speak on that subject. It was in 1984 when I as president of the Conservation Council of South Australia, and Mr Barry Cohen as the then Minister for the Environment, first made the proposal that the Lake Eyre basin be made a World Heritage area. The reason for that was that just as the Galapagos Islands are a World Heritage area then so also should be the Lake Eyre basin. It was on those islands that Darwin observed the differentiation of different species of birds and other animals. They were islands separated for some considerable time by water. It was there that he twigged to the notion of evolution, the way in which speciation occurs through genetic variation and the impact of different environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lake Eyre basin, with the ponds along the Cooper and Diamantina rivers, and also the mound springs, is analogous to the Galapagos Islands. There is speciation there to the extent that there are quite unique species occurring in perhaps only one of those mound springs. They are islands of water separated by a sea of desert. The exact same process has gone on, that process of evolution, which has given those unique species. For very important biological reasons it is important to protect that area. It has exactly the same importance as the Galapagos Islands in terms of that evolutionary model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other characteristic which encourages us to set it aside as a World Heritage area is that it has very important links with both the Aboriginal culture and with white culture following European settlement in Australia. It was precisely because of the presence of those mound springs through that very arid desert region and the waterholes on the Cooper and the Diamantina that Aboriginal people were able, over countless centuries, to go through that area and use that area for their hunting and other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when European settlement occurred then again the availability of that fresh water allowed the area to be used for exploration and eventually for the pastoral activities to which Senator Campbell has referred. So there are important cultural reasons also why that region should be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that I want to make is that there is a great deal of misunderstanding in relation to the continuance of activities in an area which has become a World Heritage area. I suspect that those pastoralists and those miners and potential miners, and so on, in the area of the Lake Eyre basin who are concerned about the protection of the area as a World Heritage area are needlessly concerned. They believe that somehow or other it is going to lock the area up and prevent a continuation of many of those activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, in relation to the unique wildlife which occurs in many of those mound springs, it will mean fencing off those mound springs so that the cattle do not go in and break them down as has happened in the past. But that is already happening to some extent because the pastoralists themselves have recognised the importance of protecting those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best example&mdash;and we may yet get to debate it today&mdash;of a World Heritage area which has continued to be used for a very important economic purpose is, of course, the Great Barrier Reef. According to legislation that we will be debating today, the reef brings in somewhere between $1 billion and $1.6 billion each year. The designation of the Great Barrier Reef as a World Heritage area has not stopped fishing, it has not stopped tourism, it has not stopped a whole lot of activities which are very important economic activities. What it has done is ensure that the qualities for which the area is designated World Heritage are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that many of the activities in the Lake Eyre Basin are quite consistent with heritage designation provided that they are carried on in a reasonable way, such as the protection of mound springs from being broken down by cattle, polluted by manure from cattle, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I press very strongly for the protection of the Lake Eyre Basin by World Heritage listing for the reasons that I have outlined.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Dairy Produce Amendment Bill will give the Australian Dairy Corporation more commercial flexibility in financing its arrangements, a move welcomed and supported by the Federal coalition. Under this legislation, the corporation will be free to undertake futures dealings with banks, although this will be restricted to hedging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention is to remove uncertainty surrounding the ability of the corporation to secure exchange rates and cover the financial risks involved in international trade. The powers are similar to those previously given to other marketing authorities such as the Wool Realisation Commission and the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is significant because the dairy industry is the largest food processing industry in Australia as well as our largest value-adding agricultural industry. Export income from dairy products this financial year is expected to exceed $900 million, up from $761 million last financial year. This year, Australia's production of milk is expected to exceed 7,000 million litres of milk, the highest level of production for 20 years. It is interesting to note that these high levels of production have not resulted in calls for cuts in production, but have been welcomed by the industry.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only product still causing concern is butter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry has been through a period of dramatic rationalisation over the last 20 years and is now enjoying a period of stability, as well as relatively high returns for farmers. Some 20 years ago, there were 47,000 dairy farmers in this country. Today there are only about 8,000 dairy farmers and they are producing as much milk, if not more, than was produced by the 47,000 farmers 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our dairy farmers are certainly among the most efficient in the world. In just 10 years, they have achieved a 25 per cent increase in the annual amount of milk produced per cow through better breeding, concentration on nutrition, and so on. Ten years ago the milk per cow was about 3,000 litres; this year it will top 4,000 litres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade, the average herd size has more than doubled, as a result of the rationalisation of the number of farmers, while sales of milk have continued to increase. In 1991-92, for example, sales went up by 32 million litres to a total of 1.8 billion litres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even so, Australia's per capita consumption of liquid milk, at 102.9 kilograms per annum, is a long way behind many other comparable countries. The Irish consume 184 kilograms of milk per year per head of population; the Finns, 172 kilograms per year per head; the Scandinavians, around 156 kilograms; and New Zealanders, 134 kilograms. The Danes, the Swiss and the Americans also consume more milk per head than we do, so there is definitely room for expansion. I am confident that the dairy industry, which is capable of innovation and clever marketing, will capitalise on that obvious potential in the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague in the other place, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), sounded a warning last week when he said that there was no room for complacency in the dairy industry. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry, although it has more confidence than it has had for a long time, still feels very exposed and vulnerable to sudden shifts on the international trading scene.</PARA>
<PARA>Then in a reference to New Zealand, he added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dairy farmers have learnt for a very long time to compete in the international market place without government assistance. They have to cope now with imports from New Zealand under closer economic relations, but they cannot do it while they have a fixed structure of costs that is many times more oppressive than that which their New Zealand counterparts have.</PARA>
<PARA>On international trade, may I remind honourable senators, the European Community is still heavily subsidising a range of products, including dairy products. Our dairy farmers have traded into these highly corrupted markets for years without government assistance. They have also competed against them in the domestic market without tariff protection, apart from an EC tariff quota arrangement. This arrangement means that, after the European Community has shipped 11,000 tonnes of cheese into Australia, we are entitled to add an import duty which is equivalent to the amount of export subsidy paid by the EC to its exporters. Meanwhile, Australia is only permitted to export 3,000 tonnes into the EC and must pay a tariff of more than 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, many people in Europe do not realise how much it costs them as taxpayers to keep the EC dairy industry going. Last March, the EC cut some of its huge subsidies and I understand that this move has the potential to lift returns to the Australian dairy industry by $30 million. Yet, despite the recent cut in payments to exporters, the EC still pays them rates up to about 240 per cent over the world price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), spoke on this Bill in the other place, he expressed grave concerns about the operation of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. `Our dairy exporters', he said, `would be considerably helped if the Government let the industry become more responsible for its own quality control and forced the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to be more efficient'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS currently charges the dairy industry about $2 million a year, 70 per cent of which is for overheads, while 30 per cent is for the cost of inspection. Like my shadow Ministry colleague, I believe those figures should be reversed, thereby giving the dairy industry a 50 per cent reduction in the cost of export inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dairy industry is highly sophisticated. It is adopting world best practice quality management techniques at a faster rate than any other commodity group, and is understandably keen to deregulate exports. The Federal coalition supports these aims and believes that AQIS should wind back rather than expand its involvement in the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, milk designed for manufacture must be passed by the State milk authority and then AQIS, making the dairy industry unique in the processed food industry and unlike other sectors such as biscuit and confectionery manufacture. Surely, if the milk meets the standard of the State milk authorities and is fit for us to drink then it is also fit for manufacture into dairy products. Instead, we have a system so ridiculous that if a dairy is being modified for a dairy company which produces for both domestic and export markets, the building must be approved by both State and Federal bodies. It is time the Federal Government cut the red tape and seriously considered viable alternatives such as State accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) pointed out, the cost of doing business in this country is too high, and the Federal Government must create a better economic environment for our export industries. So far, the dairy industry has led the way with value added product, but its expansion is constantly hampered by high costs and closed markets. Currently, milk tankers are subject to a wholesale sales tax of 20 per cent. There are 18 tyres on a milk tanker, and the tax on each tyre is $90. Excise on fuel is about 27c a litre, and transport costs are about double those faced by many of our international competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has also neglected bilateral agreements which could open up many of the currently closed markets in Asia for packaged dairy products. Clearly the Federal Government has much to do for and on behalf of the dairy industry. The Federal coalition supports this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need to make a few comments about the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill. I go back to my maiden speech&mdash;a fair while ago, now&mdash;in which I discussed at some length the dairy industry in my own State. In those days the industry was virtually down and out, and I am particularly pleased that from that position it has made a most extraordinary recovery&mdash;a recovery that is an example to any of the other industries that have been on hard times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is supported by the coalition. It was instigated by the industry which, in an effort to improve its own flexibility and its own marketing arrangements, wanted an extended range of financial management which the previous Act did not cover. That is really all the legislation is about. Having said that, it is well worth while to have a look at just what has happened and is happening on an Australia-wide basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, would like to mention the question of costs. It is absolutely ridiculous for Australia to be trying to compete on international markets when we do not allow our industries to compete on international terms. We must allow this to come about. It is not only a matter of allowing it; we must make it come about. We cannot expect our producers to compete on this ridiculous pattern in which we have all the costs at our end and all sorts of obstacles at the other end as well. We do not put obstacles of any magnitude on the product coming in, we only put them on the product going out. The industry has been trying to cope with this for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particularly applies to our situation with New Zealand. We meet New Zealand on international markets in which its costs, overheads and government imposts are nothing like ours. It is a crazy situation. We have the opportunity to produce more product into an international field where there is a market for the things that we are now producing, and we do not do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, have been known to make comments about the operation of AQIS, and I think this is another opportunity for me to do exactly that. There is no reason why it cannot be arranged that producers accept responsibility for the quality of their own product and pay penalties if it is not good enough. But they are being obstructed by enormous costs. I recently had a case where two AQIS officers were appointed and moved to King Island but there were no houses for them. This went on for some months until we were able to arrange that accommodation. I question whether having two more officers on King Island was necessary, because the work could have been done by the meatworks and the dairy organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is most impressive that, 40,000-odd dairy farmers having now been reduced to about 14,000, production has gone up to the extent that it has. I give great credit to people like John Bennett and Pat Rowley for the enormous amount of leadership they have demonstrated and for the way in which they have been able to hold a very fragmented industry together and, in very difficult times, to keep farmers moving in a forward direction so that not only are they able to survive but they can survive with dignity and with profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still a big future for the industry. The real difficulty in my area is that there is only a certain amount of land suitable for dairy farming. It just so happens that most of that land is also suitable for growing cash crops. So there is now very stiff competition between what can be made from dairying and what can be made from other products. I hope that it works out to the advantage of the farmers and that they may be able to get a better price by being under competition for the use of their land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry was all but gone in 1976-77. It is now able to recover and is looking to increase its productivity from three per cent per annum to five per cent per annum. I believe that it will. In Tasmania alone, this would be worth an extra $20 million to our economy. I am amazed at the new range of products that have come into the area. We have one factory producing UHT products, everything from custards to cat food. We now have new factories being built for specialist forms of cheese. We have whey powders of pharmaceutical grades being prepared for baby food and so on. In cheeses, yoghurts and all sorts of products the progress has been quite outstanding. I look forward to seeing those products continue to expand in the years ahead. As time is running out, I announce that I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I certainly am aware of that statement, which I very much welcome. It was appropriately made on International Museums Day and concerned the relationship between Australian museums and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is very important to note that the statement was developed in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and provides for a stronger role for indigenous people in policy making, management and care of their cultural property in public collecting institutions. It indicates that museums will undertake to provide information to communities in an accessible form so that rightful owners may request the return of objects, and museums will extend their programs to assist communities to care for cultural property in their own keeping places and in community museums.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware that merit has ever been abandoned in that sense. In terms of training of air traffic controllers, there is an important issue which, of course, concerns those honourable senators who come from Tasmania, and it is a position which the Civil Aviation Authority has adopted and which I fully support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some years, training of air traffic controllers has been conducted in a tertiary institution in Tasmania. For some time, the CAA has expressed its concern about the high failure rate, if you like, of the graduates from that institution to actually make it on the job. The change results from that concern and the decision of the CAA to establish a national system of air traffic control which involves the establishment of two complete backup air traffic control systems in Brisbane and Melbourne&mdash;that is, complete duplications of the air traffic control system that can be used in the case of a failure. Those backup systems are absolutely ideal for training air traffic controllers on the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave this matter a great deal of consideration when I was the then Minister, and it was felt by the CAA&mdash;and, I might add, in accordance with practice around the world&mdash;that it would get a far greater degree of rigorous control, and of course the control has to be very rigorous in training these officers, if they were trained on the job rather than having them trained in a separate institution in a simulated air traffic control situation. Having seen it work, let me explain how it works. The backup systems are in a position to actually replicate the real life situation that is going on in the control room next door. In other words, what is actually happening in the air can be brought up on those screens at the same time, with of course the satisfaction that, if the trainee controllers do not do it properly, two aircraft do not actually collide with each other while the trainees are training.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Such was the success of the organisation that in a very short time, in the One Nation statement of early last year, the $4 million funding to the export access program was increased by a further $8 million to expand the program, because small business was taking up and becoming involved in the program at a very rapid rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great advantages of the export access program is that it brings together small business and industry associations in a whole multitude of areas and encourages them and their members to be involved in the program.

That is proving, in my view, to be one of the major successes of the program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Reynolds for her question because it allows me to completely refute the mischievous and very wrong proposals put in this place by Senator Patterson yesterday. I want to clarify at the outset exactly the terms on which the Commonwealth offered matching funds for Christmas appeals. This was a one-off program of support for people in need over Christmas. It was using the voluntary agencies as conduits for getting help to those in need. We promised to match money raised and spent, and we did. On 6 December, the Prime Minister announced the initiative. John Dalziell, Communications Director of the Salvation Army, said on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> last night:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Prime Minister made his announcement we immediately sought clarification . . . which we got very quickly . . . it was going to be geared to what we distributed not just to what we received.</PARA>
<PARA>On 12 December an advertisement appeared in the press inviting expressions of interest, and it stated quite clearly that operational funds would not be eligible for matching funds. On 14 December the department started sending out application forms to agencies. Those forms set out the terms for the matching grants. They included the relevant time limits for fund raising and for expenditure, and the type of expenditure which would receive matching funds for their Christmas appeals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is Senator Patterson who needs to listen. In particular, eligible funds were defined as those raised between 1 November and 31 December. The eligible time period for those funds to be spent was defined as between 1 December and 31 January. Material assistance was defined as food hampers and cash relief&mdash;immediate relief for people in need during that Christmas period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 December letters were sent out by the department offering funds to successful applicants. Once again, those terms of money raised and money spent were made quite clear to all of the applicants. It is quite clear that any agency participating in the Christmas appeals knew and was fully aware of exactly what the terms of that offer were. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that the Government had reneged on its undertaking or somehow misled the agencies with regard to its support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to another very important point&mdash;the claim by Senator Patterson that the goalposts were shifted. What is important to know is that on 31 January, as the time for expending the relief had come, a number of the agencies contacted the Government and said they had not had time to complete the expenditure. So the Government, with a fair amount of generosity, extended the time for that money to be spent until 31 March, giving all the agencies another two months in which to continue to expend the money which they were having matched by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the Government has actually provided $8.74 million for eligible agencies. It is estimated that a further $3.8 million will be paid out to finalise this program. It was nothing to do with the election. The program was announced in December. The extension of the time to 31 March was decided in response to requests from the agencies at the end of January. It was never in any doubt to the agencies. I am sorry that Senator Patterson has got it so wrong.</PARA>

While it is accepted by everyone, except some people in the Opposition and a handful of doctors, that the Australian health system is not in crisis, nonetheless that is a perception that some people have tried to put over. In researching that problem&mdash;research that the Government conducted some time ago&mdash;there were a number of alarming statistics that needed to be addressed.</PARA>

All of those things were wrong, but they were all perceptions that in the Government's view needed to be corrected.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1993, the Secretary to the Department of Defence and the Permanent Secretary for Defence Development from the Republic of Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding covering defence science cooperation. Under the auspices of the memorandum of understanding, a joint project in the area of defence communications has commenced. Another joint project on jet engine modelling is being planned. Both of these projects will involve exchange of technical information and the posting of Singaporean engineers into DSTO laboratories. DSTO also expects to provide Singapore with scientific support on a fee for service basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DSTO has a joint project in place with Malaysia to measure ship magnetism.

We have to obey the various guidelines put down by the Department of Finance on disposal of surplus equipment. We are doing that in this particular case.

Noting that it is not private sources but his Government that is paying this very high salary to the head of the MFP, how does the Government defend this enormous disparity in income?

The truth of the matter is that there are market forces at work that determine the kinds of salaries that have to be paid to chief executives of significant organisations in this country that have a particular responsibility to work with the private sector and to encourage large-scale private sector investment, which is of course what we are chasing in the context of the MFP exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>

Against that background, in those circumstances, while I am not aware of the precise considerations that determined this salary on this occasion, I believe the amount that has been determined by the board appears, on the face of it, defensible.</PARA>

We must remember that Australia is a party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. This means that our domestic law and practice have to be and are in fact in accordance with the obligation set out in article 34 of the convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Reid this day, relating to the employment and training criteria used by the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>There are three aspects of the matter that need to be dealt with arising from the question and the Minister's answer: firstly, the question of the balloting of the students for employment; secondly, the nature of the employment in the first place; and, thirdly, that part of the Minister's answer which in fact dealt with the motion I moved yesterday dealing with the location of the school in Launceston. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go over speeches that I have made previously which dealt with the fact that the school should never have been placed in Launceston and clearly should have been in the national capital in the first place. It was placed in Launceston for political reasons. The folly of that decision has now been proved by the Minister's statement today about and endorsing shifting it from Launceston, the cost to taxpayers all-up being about $40 million. Goodness knows what it will cost to relocate the facilities in Melbourne and Brisbane, as is presently planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that at least is one aspect of the argument. My notice of motion yesterday asked the Minister to make a statement to the Senate about why this is happening and the costs. At least from his answer today we know that he approves of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the course has been operating in Launceston. I wish to refer in particular to the students who did the course during 1991 and 1992. They responded to an advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> of 6 and 7 October 1990, which advertisement said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Graduates will be eligible for employment as air traffic controllers or flight service officers with the Civil Aviation Authority following successful completion of final field training. Persons embarking on a career with the CAA will find it challenging and rewarding.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure they would if they could actually get jobs. At the bottom of the advertisement, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Course numbers are structured to meet the needs of the CAA and employment opportunities are excellent.</PARA>
<PARA>If we examine the facts, we could only come to the conclusion that that advertisement was misleading. Thirty-three students completed the course in 1992, having started their course at the beginning of January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It transpires that within six months the CAA knew that the students would not get jobs but it did not tell them. They found that out near the end of their course, in November 1992. Having completed the course, and graduated in the order of numbers from one to 33, they then found out that they would not be employed in order of merit. A ballot was to be held for the positions that they would be offered. I do not know whether any of them have actually been offered jobs, but many of them would have taken up other courses had they known that this advertisement was false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 January 1993 the ballot took place in Canberra, none of the students being present, so far as I know. It is confirmed in correspondence that the Civil Aviation Authority came to the conclusion that balloting, raffling, its students was the way to offer opportunities for employment, not merit in the order in which they had passed their exams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister to deal with the Civil Aviation Authority, and require that authority to deal with those students in the way that the Public Service now deals with promotions, that is in the order of merit. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from the Authority, dated 6 January 1993, which confirms that the ballot took place on 5 January, and also to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the list of names of students, one to 33 under the heading `Ballot held in Canberra on Tuesday 5 January 1993'. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with George Grunbaum's advice of 9 December 1992 that the Authority would use the ballot system as the fairest method of allocating training places to graduates of UoTL Course 5 I advise as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ballot for places occurred in Canberra on Tuesday 5 January 1993. The actual draw was conducted by the ATS Division's Financial Controller, Mr Daryl Cathro and witnessed by an officer of our Internal Audit Office. All locally resident Course 5 students were invited to observe the ballot process and Greg Tracey and Trevor Wright attended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complete balloted order of students is attached. We expect to contact the first four students in mid-1993 in relation to them joining Flight Service Conversion Course 4 during August 1993. The remaining student intakes are expected to be in accordance with the timetable previously advised, a copy of which is also attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome of the ballot process was such that we hope to be able to accommodate students' preferences as far as postings to Brisbane and Melbourne are concerned. However, postings to other locations remain a possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should any students reach agreement on a mutual swap of places on the ballot listing they should contact us to ensure that such can be accommodated within the training program and final posting arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Brownhill this day, relating to the certification by the Civil Aviation Authority of aircraft being sold by the RAAF.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter possibly involves Senator Collins as well. The question relates to the aircraft that are being sold. I have been contacted by the Broadmeadows College of Technical and Further Education about the sale of those aircraft. The college, or someone associated with it, is interested in looking at them. I understand that it is being suggested that an amount of $40,000 will need to be spent on those aircraft to bring them up to a standard that will allow them to be registered, so that they can be flown in civilian air space. The RAAF has in the past been flying them in civilian air space. The query is raised as to why they should now require these modifications to enable them to fly in the same air space.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a suggestion, from the CAA to the air training corps, that a waiver is not possible for use by cadets of these aircraft in a flying-training role. I ask either Senator Ray or Senator Collins to indicate whether they would be prepared to consider an exemption for air training corps from the CAA requiring these qualifications so that the aircraft can be used by cadets for flying training purposes only. The matter is a fraction urgent because the auction is on at the end of this week, I understand, and these people are interested in some response to this before they consider their position in bidding at the auction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On this matter I probably cannot be as helpful as the Minister representing the CAA. Even Senator Macdonald might think that the Minister would like to concentrate on another couple of matters for the next few minutes. I will give a general answer to supplement the answer I gave Senator Brownhill. In fact, 51 aircraft have been acquired since 1975. Forty-seven of these are now available for disposal. There have been a number of requests indicating an interest in purchasing the aircraft&mdash;and I suppose there have been some people wanting them for nothing, as always happens with military equipment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that in their present configuration the aircraft would not be immediately eligible for registration on the CAA civil register, which is the same information as the senator has. All the aircraft require a number of modifications to bring them to the standard which the CAA has accepted for certification of a number of the CT4B aircraft operated by British Aerospace and Ansett Technologies at Tamworth, New South Wales, for pilot training and flight screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the costs are, as has been quoted here, about $40,000. As to why there is this dichotomy between the standard for a military aircraft and that for a civilian aircraft, I have not gone back into the mists of time to find out what the circumstances are. It has been known for quite some time, though, that these planes were up for disposal. I think I signed off this particular matter in January 1993. I think those opposite would concede it would be most unreasonable if we spent $40,000 per aircraft in Defence to upgrade them. We sell them as is. They can be used for a number of different purposes but, if they are to be used for the purpose of carrying the general public, then they will need the $40,000 spent on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crux of the matter raised is whether a distinction can be made if the aircraft are used for CAA training. I will pass that on as quickly as I can to my colleague to try to get a response before the weekend. I simply do not know whether I can or cannot. Clearly, if I cannot, I hope that the matter continues to be negotiable. If those at Broadmeadows, or wherever it is, decide to put in a purchase order, maybe negotiations on the matter can ensue. It is really the first time this matter has been directly put to me in this way. I have known that it was going to cost $40,000 to upgrade the planes for CAA. I did not know of this other function that they could be used for&mdash;nor should I. I really prefer not to know who the potential tenderers and auctioneers are. I usually like to be informed after the event. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was disappointed that Senator Ray resorted to the Collins defence of blaming the Department of Finance for the tendering process. If that is the advice from the Department of Finance, then the department ought to reconsider its position. Hardly any aircraft at all have been sold in Australia. To dump 36 aircraft in one block, irrespective of whether they meet registration standards or not, just kills the market: it cannot be done. There is no loss for the Commonwealth in holding these aircraft and selling them in smaller units over a six-month or 12-month period at a rate which the market could absorb. I believe we are going to lose quite a lot of money under the procedures proposed by the Department of Finance. I would seriously suggest to Senator Ray that the department ought to talk to some people in the industry if it is faced with similar situations in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). He is usually across his department, but today I do not think he is quite across it as well as he could be. Maybe that is because the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) might be taking a part in this matter as well. I want to take Senator Ray up on a couple of points he made regarding selling to the highest bidder and regarding market demand. Surely, the Minister, if he were fully responsible for the Defence Department, would be making sure of business best practice, which would mean that he would be trying to do the best for his department to get the best value from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other matters were overlooked and I bring them to the attention of the Minister. The first is the safety angle of the airplanes which, as the Minister alluded to, have been quite willingly flying in airspace and which now have to be upgraded if they are to be used in the same airspace under a different category. That is rather disturbing. The second point is that the Minister said that the upgrading would cost $40,000, which is quite correct, but if there are 800 engineers in the RAAF, surely they could have helped with the upgrading of those planes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the auction, there are some 36 aircraft&mdash;although we are now told there are 51&mdash;which, if they are sold at an estimated&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the 36 were sold at, say, $25,000, that brings in about $900,000. If they were sold separately over a period, as Senator MacGibbon suggested, then that would bring in something like 36 multiplied by $35,000 or more. The extra money would be good for the department and it would be a fairer sale. On the basis of the figures presented earlier, something like an extra $1 million-plus would be coming into the department. That represents quite a difference. Being taxpayers' money, I would imagine that in his ministerial capacity, and being a frugal person, the Minister would be more interested in making sure that the taxpayers were as well looked after as any other interested parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express to the Minister my disappointment that the safety angle has not been discussed in regard to the fact that airplanes that had previously been able to fly in an airspace now have to be upgraded to fly in the same airspace. Surely that can be looked at in the future. The Minister can look at using the resources of his department to ensure it obtains the best value for its dollar. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Newman this day, relating to home childcare allowances.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will recall, my question was related to the home child-care allowance, which was an election promise targeted at Australian families where a parent is providing for their own child care. It is going to involve a cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate for families with children. It was also a recommendation of the bipartisan Lavarch committee inquiring into the status of women. It has been part of the national debate in this country for a long time. Those working in the home, providing for their own child care, have been calling for this allowance for ages. Yet the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)&mdash;I emphasise that it is family services&mdash;firstly tried to answer some other question altogether. She got the wrong end of the stick about what sort of child care I was talking about, and then she tried to duck the question entirely by saying that I was asking the question of the wrong Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that it was the wrong Minister. This Minister does not seem to know much about families at all. Any time she is asked anything she gets the wrong end of the stick. This issue was important enough to Australian families for the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to regard it as an extremely important promise and to include it in his election policy speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said, `It's time'. Clearly, from the Minister's evasion, the time is not yet ripe. The measure needs to be introduced at the beginning of the financial year because it relates to an annual tax rebate which is to be cashed out, presumably through the Department of Social Security. If it is not done on 1 July this year, it presumably will have to be delayed until 1 July 1994 at the earliest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is hardly an indication of the urgency with which the Prime Minister seemed to attend to it in his policy speech. The reality is what the dogs are barking all over Canberra: the Expenditure Review Committee is not going to pass the Government's election promises&mdash;avoiding and delaying any it can get away with. We have already seen it welshing on the removing of the pensioners from the tax system; we have seen it welshing on buying hospital beds in the private sector; we have seen it welshing on starting up the emergency dental health program, and now the Government is clearly getting Australian families to take a raincheck on the home child-care allowance. It was always a pretty deceitful promise anyway. It was a pea and thimble sort of trick. It was sold as $30 a week for families who provided their own child-care; yet in reality it was a transfer from the father's wallet to the mother's purse, plus $2.80 in tips. It is nice to have that extra $2.80, until we remember that that $2.80 is coming out of that same family's pocket by way of the taxes it has to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That did not bother the Government all that much because it was pretty good for a headline on the evening news. At that stage of the election, if honourable members can recall, that was all that was worrying the Government at the time. It did not really expect to be in government, and it spewed out promises willy-nilly, never really thinking about either the cost or the implementation. It has been pretty clear in the answers that we have been getting from the Ministers just lately that implementation and cost really were ignored. We saw Senator Richardson yesterday trying to bluff his way through the election promise about the dental health system, and then being forced to admit later that the Government was breaking a promise by putting back its emergency dental health program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the reduction of the Government's commitment to match the funding of the major welfare organisations, and we have seen the Minister fudge the issue of the home child-care allowance by simply saying it was being considered in the Budget process. If it is being considered in the Budget process, it is being delayed substantially, and yet on 24 February the Prime Minister said, `Labor believes it's time to redirect this assistance and convert the tax rebate to a cash benefit paid directly to the spouse at home caring for the children'. That promise was going to cost $326 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to ask in this chamber is: which four years are we talking about&mdash;the next four years? Or are we talking about starting up the implementation of this program in maybe the year 2000? Maybe this is all part of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards 2000</EMPHASIS>. Certainly the Australian voters at the election thought these promises were being introduced straightaway. No fine print was delivered to the voters when they signed on the dotted line for this Government. At the next election I guess they are going to want to see every t crossed and every i dotted because this Government cannot be trusted with promises, just like it cannot be trusted to run the country. This is just the latest in a long line of examples of the inability of this Government to commit itself honestly to what it is promising the Australian people. </PARA>

I think it is another example of the department running the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Knowles this day, relating to the employment of women in higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>The question I asked today was about the impact of the affirmative action legislation on the percentage of women above the senior lecturer level in higher education. I was absolutely fascinated to hear the Minister's non-answer because she did not go into any of the areas of the specific request that I had made. She launched a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women in Australia </EMPHASIS>only a couple of weeks ago. I was quite happy to be associated with the launch, but I am surprised to notice that she has not actually read the book. The fact is that the percentage of women above senior lecturer level in higher education has actually fallen. The book states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women's representation among academic staff declined with level, from over 50 per cent of staff below lecturer level to less than 10 per cent of staff above senior lecturer level in 1991. Women's representation at above senior lecturer level declined from 13 per cent in 1988 to 10 per cent in 1991&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is an overall 30 per cent reduction in the number of women. The book continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but increased in all the other categories of academic staff.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley today went on to say that there had been general increases across the board and that the affirmative action legislation was working particularly well. Why is it that a government, through the Minister, continues to tell the people of Australia that this legislation is working particularly effectively when in fact in education, in the Public Service and in various other areas under the Government's control the legislation has clearly failed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the Minister familiarise herself with the very book that she launched and come into the Senate and give us a straight answer as to the situation in this particular area. As I say, she launched the book, and what we need to know in the Senate is why is the affirmative action legislation not being trumpeted by her and her Government consistently. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Reynolds this day, relating to Government support for charitable organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>Today on the Pru Goward show Senator Crowley said that she was appalled at the beat-up of the Opposition on the issue of grants to organisations in the Christmas appeal. She said that some of the charitable organisations are quite distressed that this kind of misrepresentation has emerged. There was no misrepresentation, and I have had no representation from any of those organisations that they were distressed. Of course, they are grateful for the money they receive from the Government, but I am distressed at the way they were given that money. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does no good at all to have gotten it as wrong as this and I hope the Opposition will be able to make an apology, because they have very, very unfairly misrepresented what was promised and what was delivered. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to know, and I want Senator Crowley to tell me, how I and the Opposition misrepresented the situation. On 6 December the Prime Minister in a press release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to announce today that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas appeals.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said on 6 December. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on 6 December&mdash;on the same day&mdash;he said to Laurie Oakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So let me say to you, Laurie, that for every dollar that the voluntary agencies like the St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, the Salvation Army collect for material assistance, the Commonwealth will match for the Christmas Appeals.</PARA>
<PARA>There he is again saying, `for every dollar that they collect'. On 11 December, again in a press release, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I announced on 6 December 1992 that the Government will match dollar for dollar cash donations by the Australian public to major voluntary agencies for their Christmas appeals.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on in great detail in that press release about the conditions surrounding the Government's funding. He talked about the organisations that would be eligible, and stated that they must have a sound record in material aid, et cetera. But nowhere did the Prime Minister say that the Government's funding would involve only the dollars spent by the agencies over a specific period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not misrepresent the situation. I came into the chamber yesterday and said that the goalposts had changed. For a week the agencies believed those press releases. On the basis of those press releases the agencies actually started to look at how they would organise their spending patterns. The Prime Minister has the habit of legislating by press release, so I suppose the agencies were to be excused for thinking that this was no different. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, a spokesman for Senator Crowley&mdash;and maybe this is wrong; Senator Crowley can advise us&mdash;said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the contract signed by the major welfare groups on December 11 said "matching funds means grants equivalent to amounts of Christmas appeals donations received or expected to be raised between November 1 and December 30, 1992, and expended between December 1 and January 30, 1993".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the first the public knew about it&mdash;except for the advertisements that appeared on 12 December. We have not been able to get a copy of those advertisements. Maybe the public was told then. In an interview with Senator Crowley, Pru Goward said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, the Prime Minister's Press Release actually said</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government will match dollar-for-dollar cash donations by the Australian public, which a reasonable man, I'd have thought would take that to mean the money raised, and according to the charities it was only later that the Government decided what they really meant was the money spent.</PARA>
<PARA>Pru Goward thought that; the public obviously thought that. Then, in an editorial appearing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> on 13 December, it is obvious that the editor thought that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister Keating's promise of matching dollar for dollar the money raised by some organisations in the lead up to Christmas will help some but not all families.</PARA>
<PARA>On 19 December, Mr Wilson, the chief administrative officer of St Vincent de Paul, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then we've got Prime Minister Keating's promise of a dollar for dollar raised by us. That will help take the pressure off.</PARA>
<PARA>The community believed that, and that is what the donors believed. The Government has duped the donors of Australia. I have had phone calls to my office by people saying that they gave money on that understanding. They have been duped. That is the issue. The Australian public was told by the Prime Minister that the Government would match dollar for dollar the money that was raised by those organisations. That is what people believed when they gave donations to those organisations. That is the great untruth; that is the great misrepresentation. For Senator Crowley to say that I created mischief is very poor indeed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Loosley this day, relating to the advertising of entitlements under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson missed the whole point of my interjection and the objection of the health agencies to the expenditure of nearly $3 million to inform people of their entitlements under Medicare. Medicare has been in existence for 10 years. People do not choose to be ill; they get ill, and then they seek access to health care providers. Advertising their entitlements under Medicare is a total waste of taxpayers' funds because of that very point. That is the point that has completely escaped the bureaucracy and Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with Medicare has not gone away because of the election, and it was not a point scoring exercise. There is enormous difficulty of access in relation to the public hospital system. The money spent on advertising the virtues of Medicare should well be spent, as Senator Richardson has acknowledged, on advising people to get private insurance because then they would get access to the hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been noted that the waiting times in the public hospital system, certainly in Queensland, vary by anything from seven months to get an orthopaedic appointment or to get into an ENT outpatients ward, to 18 months once one is advised to have surgery. I have a letter before me from a patient in Nambour who has been waiting three years to have a tonsillectomy. I would suggest that some of that money should be spent on the Nambour hospital so this lady can have her tonsillectomy instead of currently having to go to her local general practitioner to get antibiotics to stave off the symptoms. I am happy to notify the Minister of the name of that patient if he so desires it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is absolute rubbish to spend this money on advertising the availability of Medicare when people cannot get into hospital. I suggest the Minister is suffering from mythomania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Deputy President, as you would be aware, yesterday the Senate passed an order by consent, in effect&mdash;there was no government objection to it&mdash;that certain documents be tabled by midday today. Those documents concerning the satellite tender and the MDS process were to be tabled in the Senate by 12 o'clock today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 12 o'clock today, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) came into the chamber. We thought that we were either going to get the documents or an explanation as to why the documents could not be tabled. Approximately an hour later we had achieved neither. We still do not know whether the Government had any real explanation of why it was unable to table the documents, and we certainly do not have the documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage debate on the matter was adjourned until later in the day so that the Minister might consider his position and so that, hopefully, we would get the documents in accordance with the order of the Senate or, alternatively, hear from the Minister as to why he was unable to comply. This debate has now been reopened, for which I thank the Senate. I think we are at the stage where what we are really doing is giving the Minister a further opportunity to act in accordance with the order, or to make some satisfactory explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put this matter a little more into context. I said that the order was made yesterday by consent. Yesterday certainly no indication was given by the Minister that he would be unable to comply with such an order. I guess that that is not surprising, because we have been hearing for some weeks that there is no difficulty in the Minister tabling documents in relation to these two matters and, in fact, that they would be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, I do not want to take much more of the Senate's time, but I take you back to 6 May. In answer to questions from my colleague Senator Alston, who asked that a whole range of documents in relation to the satellite pay television licences be tabled, Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will table the documents which apply to Senator Alston's question. As I said yesterday, I have asked my departmental secretary to start the process of getting those documents together now.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins said that on 6 May. Those documents included advices, notes of telephone conversations&mdash;all relevant material, in effect, to the satellite process. On 13 May the Minister also said, in effect addressing Senator Alston:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This I can guarantee: the maximum number of papers will be lodged on Tuesday. If any are left out, I imagine that it will not be long after that that they will be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA>Then yesterday Senator Collins, in relation to Professor Pearce, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce has been examining all of the papers connected with this matter. He has had access to whatever officers of the department he wished to speak to about it. His report, together with the papers that he has examined, will be tabled in this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>We have got to this stage, and certainly Senator Collins has now tabled Professor Pearce's report and two documents&mdash;but he has certainly not tabled all the documents that Professor Pearce has examined. Certainly Senator Collins has not complied with the order of yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's order was very carefully drawn to try to reduce the number of documents that we would require, because we understand that there is a certain management difficulty in dealing with a lot of paper. We were at pains to try to be more specific&mdash;more specific than those that the Minister had indicated earlier that he would be able to provide to the Senate. So we were not even keeping him to his earlier undertakings. We tried to be helpful by reducing the number and focusing on the documents that were particularly relevant to the questions that we were seeking to have answered, and the order was in that form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Collins has not complied with the order. He has not complied with any of the undertakings that were given on any of these days. He has not complied even with the statement that he made yesterday that he would table all the documents that Professor Pearce considered. We of course, not surprisingly, find that just a totally unsatisfactory situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one document that immediately struck me as being relevant. It was referred to on page 5 of Professor Pearce's report and is a draft determination that was floating around, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document includes the statement that tenderers for a pay-TV licence `are not required to pay a deposit to enter the process'.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that was a vitally important document for us to have to make our determination whether this Minister has met the standard of performance of a Minister that we think is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to argue that Professor Pearce has made certain assessments, but that does not absolve us of our responsibilities. We have responsibilities to make certain assessments, and we can only do that if we have access to the necessary documents. We have had undertakings to produce those documents time and again, and they have not been produced. That forced us to the stage yesterday of seeking an order of the Senate that they be produced. Obviously we do not go down that path unnecessarily, but they were not being introduced. We sought the order, and the Minister said he consented to the order. The order was made. The documents have not been tabled and we still have no satisfactory explanation why that has not occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I raise the matter again and invite the Minister to either comply with the order or put to the Senate an explanation that we can consider. If the Minister is not prepared to do that, then we obviously have no alternative than to take other actions that are open to us because, as much as Ministers might not like being called to account by the Senate, it is our responsibility that they are and we are not going to let them avoid their responsibilities so easily by simply snubbing their nose at the Senate in the way that Senator Collins has done today. </PARA>

He indicated at the time of doing so in the Parliament that he had not yet had the opportunity to look at the details of the motion before him, but clearly what he understood to be involved in the motion was an order for the production of documents which was very much more limited in its scope than that which had previously been the subject of Opposition attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as Senator Collins said yesterday, the original scope of opposition requests&mdash;on the MDS side of the equation alone&mdash;could have extended to something like 113,000 pages of material. What Senator Alston was now proposing was something much more limited. So Senator Collins accepted it on the basis that it was a much more confined task confronting him. Senator Collins also accepted the order yesterday without demur on the basis that, at that stage, he understood that the Pearce report&mdash;which has in fact now been tabled today&mdash;would not be required or expected to be tabled until next Monday. So it was on the assumption that the Pearce report would have that many more days of gestation that Senator Collins agreed yesterday to bringing forward his obligation to table this batch of papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, what then happened yesterday afternoon was that further discussions were held outside this chamber&mdash;so they are not documented and inevitably recollections will vary about what occurred&mdash;and Senator Collins was requested to bring forward the tabling of the Pearce report from Monday to today. Senator Collins acceded to that request in the knowledge of and with the implication that, by doing so, the time and attention of his office and the relevant departmental officers involved would thereby be totally preoccupied with the bringing forward of the Pearce report, preparing the details of its presentation, being prepared to answer questions and so on.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not it was practicable at the time of agreement yesterday to meet this order, it certainly became hopelessly impracticable to do so in the circumstances as they evolved yesterday afternoon. That really is the reason why it just has not been possible to do the work necessary to bring the papers forward today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What matters less, I would hope, than what has happened in the past is what should happen now. It is perfectly reasonable for the Senate, having passed an order and not having it complied with, to seek an explanation and to seek an indication of what response is now contemplated. The response that we propose to make, having had an opportunity to look at the scale of the task that is yet to be performed is this: we would propose&mdash;and we will make this the subject of explicit undertakings by Senator Collins in a moment&mdash;that we look at the order in two parts, the first part being documents relating to the satellite licence tender process, namely, the report that has been already put down now by Pearce. Let us call it Pearce report No. 1. The documents that are sought in relation to that are those here identified in the motion:  copies of any requests, copies of any legal, technical or other advice. They are further described in the text of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, let us look at, as a separate exercise, the similar kinds of documents related to the MDS licence tender process which is to be the subject of Pearce report No. 2&mdash;if we might so describe it&mdash;which report will be tabled in this Parliament next Wednesday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the second category of documents is concerned, namely, requests for advice and copies of any legal, technical or other advice relating to the MDS process relating to Pearce report No. 2, we are proposing that those documents be tabled in the Parliament no later than next Wednesday. Indeed, if it is possible to table them any earlier than next Wednesday, if it is possible to table Pearce report No. 2 any earlier than next Wednesday, we will do so, and Senator Collins will give that undertaking. Present indications are, given the scale of the task, that that is not likely to be achievable any earlier than next Wednesday. But that is certainly our objective and that is the undertaking that Senator Collins is prepared to give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So far as the other category of documents is concerned relating to Pearce report No. 1, or the satellite process, the undertaking that we are prepared to give in relation to this category is as follows: Senator Collins will table these documents as soon as he is able to do so and, in any event, no later than next Monday, when Parliament resumes. If it is possible to complete the task today, tonight, before Parliament rises, then Senator Collins will come into the Parliament and make the documents available. If the task is completed, as seems likely, not by tonight but some time tomorrow or Saturday or even Sunday, then Senator Collins will undertake to make the documents thus prepared available to the Opposition spokesman and the Democrats spokesperson as soon as those documents are ready and as soon as they can be couriered to whatever location they are&mdash;as has happened, I understand, with other documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The reason why some more time is required to prepare all these documents for presentation should, I hope, be obvious to honourable senators, but let me just spell it out in case it is not. Time until now has been totally preoccupied, for all the relevant officers and advisers, in going through the other steps that have been involved in leading up to producing and tabling today the Pearce report and dealing with the ongoing saga of the MDS licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the scope of the request has now been much confined, which we appreciate, it is not just a matter obviously of retrieving and putting into a single pile all the documents that satisfy this description. It is a matter, in accordance with the time-honoured procedures and practices of this place on which I have had occasion to rely on various occasions, perfectly understood and accepted that there are legitimate grounds for non-disclosure. I do not seek to identify now all possible grounds that might be relied upon or might be relevant to these particular documents, but there are manifestly at least three: Cabinet-in-confidence, commercial-in-confidence, and documents, the nature of which or the nature of parts of which may adversely impact on the conduct of legal proceedings, or prejudice any party to legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are legal proceedings currently extant in relation to the MDS side of the process&mdash;not, I verily believe, so far as the satellite part of it is concerned, but there is a sense in which these issues are intertwined; for example, the consideration of tender processes, practices and procedures and so on. There is a sense in which it may be that some of the documents that relate to the satellite side of it could impact on legal proceedings extant elsewhere. Obviously the documents have to be looked at very carefully against these criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will take more time than people have had until now. It may not take more time than this evening, before Parliament gets up. If it does, it will not take any more time than next Monday afternoon, when we resume; and I repeat that Senator Collins is prepared to give the undertaking, whenever the documents are prepared, to make them available to Senator Bourne so that she has maximum time to prepare whatever response she wants to make to them. That is the situation, as I understand it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Australian Democrats do see this motion of the Senate as an extremely serious matter. It has been explained to us that its scope is much smaller than the original scope, and we accept that. It has also been explained to us by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) that the Pearce report on satellite tendering was originally going to come down on Tuesday. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) brought it forward to Monday&mdash;at our request and the request of the Opposition, I must say&mdash;and I do accept that I was one of the people who went to Senator Collins yesterday and said that it would be very good if the report came in today so we could look at it over the weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am hearing now is that Senator Collins then went and asked for things to be speeded up, and that that took personnel away from getting these other documents together. I did not realise at the time that that would be one of the consequences, and I apologise to the Senate if I am in any way responsible for that consequence. I must say, though, that the Minister's office should have realised that that could have been one of the consequences, and perhaps something should have been done there. But I concede that the Minister was in the Senate with Senator Kernot almost all day yesterday, so for his part getting those documents together would have been very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that the MDS information should come down next week, after we have seen the results of the second Pearce inquiry. We are being told now that Wednesday, at the latest, is the day for the presentation of the report of the second Pearce inquiry. Given that we are going to have valedictories on Thursday, which may take up half a day, and I imagine we will be very busy on Thursday morning, I would really like to have set aside an entire day in the Senate if necessary to discuss the second Pearce report. I would like to see the documents, if not the second Pearce report, on Tuesday night at the very latest. That would give us that night to look through them and we would want to have a look at the Pearce report by the next morning, at the very latest. </PARA>

I did in fact also give the explanation for this during the luncheon session but I will give it again now. The undertaking to table all the documents that Professor Pearce examined in relation to this report was given in good faith and what subsequently happened simply gives an indication of just how independent Professor Pearce's handling of this matter has been. And I am still happy to discharge the obligation, Senator Hill. Outside of his formal examination of me, with his assistant Dr whoever it was, I have had no contact with Professor Pearce.

It will be our contention that the only appropriate place for that matter is in the Senate. At the end of the Minister's tabling statement, he said, `I'd rather be found accused of an error of judgment than to stand here today accused of a rush to judgment'. That seems to imply that, because the report talks in terms of an error of judgment, Senator Collins is accepting responsibility for that at worst.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not mean to say it is another description of negligence; I meant to say it is the opposite to negligence. It is saying that there is no negligence involved; it is merely an error of judgment. The fact is that quite obviously a lot went wrong, yet the final conclusion is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not consider that my inquiry has revealed any systemic deficiency in the Department's practices,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is not surprising because Professor Pearce is only dealing with one episode&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">nor has it revealed a general want of capability in any officers of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems quite a surprising conclusion to reach when one accepts that Professor Pearce says that it was desirable that matters were brought to the attention of the Minister. One would have expected officers of the department to have addressed this issue and, in various ways, Professor Pearce makes it clear that he thinks the issue of a deposit would have been discussed. I find it surprising when it is suggested a deposit was not discussed. He goes on to make it clear that he believes these matters should have been brought to the attention of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is quite a separate question to what actions the Minister himself should have taken, and I will deal with that briefly. It is quite clear that this is not a Minister without any experience at all; this is a Minister who had been the Minister for Communications for some nine months as at January of this year&mdash;a Minister who was clearly aware of pre-existing approaches to tender, and particularly in this area. If one looks at paragraph 46, one sees:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the date of the pay-TV determination he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was familiar with the MDS and AM-FM conversion procedures, both of which required payment of deposits (of differing kinds).</PARA>
<PARA>It follows from that that this was not a Minister acting in ignorance; this was not a Minister who knew nothing about communications; this was a Minister who was familiar with the procedures that had been adopted in other instances and who, therefore, ought to have immediately turned his mind to what procedures were being followed in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what Senator Collins has previously said. He said that he had read the determination of 19 January before he signed it. He said that he checked it for completeness. Professor Pearce says of Senator Collins:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister thinks that he read the minute sometime in the period before his return to Canberra on 18 January. . . </PARA>
<PARA>He is there talking about a draft determination dated 4 January which is attached as appendix 3. It is perfectly clear that Professor Pearce is expressing grave concern about the procedures in the Minister's office. The minute which was hand delivered to the Minister's office was not logged in in the normal fashion. Presumably the only reason why Professor Pearce does not reach any conclusion at the end in that regard is that, again, he accepts that he is only examining the failings of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that that document was read by the Minister sometime between 4 and 19 January. Indeed, as I understand it, he also read the actual determination before he signed it. So on two separate occasions the Minister's attention was drawn to the requirement for only a $500 application fee; therefore, there is no excuse whatsoever for the Minister not to have turned his mind to the subject and sought advice. </PARA>

That is clearly nowhere near good enough if one wants to get to the bottom of this fiasco, let alone to make sure it does not happen again. The only appropriate way that can be achieved is by establishing a select committee and ensuring that the proper processes are followed, that the failings are properly identified and that the system starts to work. But all we have here is pointing to a whole range of things that went wrong but then saying, `Well, it's no-one's fault in particular; indeed, it's no-one's fault'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate about this issue has become focused almost exclusively on whether the Minister should be sacked. This is obviously a very important question. As I said last Tuesday during the discussion of a matter of public importance relating to this matter, the Democrats we believe that any Minister should resign if he makes a serious error which he had sufficient information to avoid making. On the evidence in this report the Democrats do not believe that the Minister's resignation is warranted. On balance, the error appears to lie with the department. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility, as we defined it, demands that the Minister get on with cleaning up this mess. </PARA>

However, given the findings in this report the Democrats believe that the objectives I have stated would be best served by ministerial continuity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch the Minster for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, suggested to the Senate that this document was a report which was put together to determine whether he should resign. That is an extraordinary statement for Senator Collins to make. He obviously did not even get as far as page 1, or maybe he got as far as page 1 but his memory became rather selective. On page 1 of his report, Professor Pearce says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (it should be observed that the terms of reference do not require me to comment on issues arising from the doctrine of ministerial responsibility).</PARA>
<PARA>That clearly establishes that this document cannot, in any sense of the word, be seen to be an excuse for, or a vindication of, the Minister's own incompetence. Nor does it allow Senator Collins to escape the consequences of his responsibility as a Minister. His responsibility as a Minister is to oversee his department and to answer to this Parliament. It is our responsibility in this Parliament to see that he answers to us, and to see that he is held accountable for what happens within his department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt we are going to hear from Senator Collins at length. No doubt we are going to hear every single story he can possibly come up with. He may even tell us about sitting under a tree in Maningrida. Senator Collins has left us all sitting under a tree at Maningrida because they do not have pay TV there and nor do we. It is going to take us a hell of a lot longer to get pay TV because of the mess-up that Senator Collins has made of this issue. Senator Collins is beyond useless. He does not even have a purpose. He is purposeless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go through this report and see how it, in itself, raises issues that go right to the heart of Senator Collins's ability as a Minister, and his ability to discharge his obligations not just in regard to his department, but here&mdash;to answer for that department in this chamber. One of the interesting things about this report is that it highlights the fact that the advice, the minute, that was given to the Minister sat in his office for 14 days. I am not saying that every bit of correspondence that comes into the office of a senator gets turned around within 14 days. It would be grossly untrue to say that. However, when one gets the single most important piece of paper that is likely to cross one's desk, at least in the space of that month, if not perhaps in the space of the first six months of that year, one might want to have a look. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might even give Senator Collins the benefit of the doubt and say that if it was sitting on his desk for 14 days maybe he was actually considering it. That is the most charitable thing we can say about Senator Collins. But I do not think he was considering it. The document in question, which is attached to this report as appendix 3, says some interesting things. At the bottom of the first page of the document, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft determination makes it clear that the allocation process is to be a tender procedure with the highest price tendered being the sole criteria if the other considerations are met.</PARA>
<PARA>The minute then goes on to outline the other considerations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These other considerations are the submission of an adequate industry plan (with the possibility of a plan being imposed as a licence condition if the submitted plan is inadequate), approval from the Trade Practices Commission as required by the Act and possible ABA consideration of the suitability of the applicant.</PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft determination requires the tenderers to provide a $500 application fee that will make a small contribution to the costs of the process&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and given the mix-up we have had with this process, that will make a very small contribution&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and help discourage frivolous tenders.</PARA>
<PARA>There is absolutely no reference at all to a deposit. It makes it very clear that it is price and price alone, subject to those other considerations and to no other considerations. It is very clear from that, that if Senator Collins had read this minute, and it is only a two-page minute, he might have had cause&mdash;a reasonable person might have had cause&mdash;to say, `Maybe I should ask about the possibility of a deposit. We have done it with the others. Maybe I should ask about it here'. But no, this minute sat there for 14 days and Senator Collins did not even think to ask. I remember once asking a colleague of mine in the Queensland State Parliament, a very successful Minister&mdash;</PARA>

The truth of the matter is that some of the Minister's backbench colleagues who have some integrity, some who have decided not to come into the chamber today because they cannot stand behind him and back him all the way, do not have confidence in his ability to discharge his job. It is interesting that, even a couple of weeks ago, before all of the other damning evidence came out against the Minister, one of his colleagues said to me that, frankly, he did not want to defend the Minister because the Minister had stuffed up and he could not, in good conscience, defend him. That is the truth. The Minister does not even have the confidence of some of his own backbench.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think the absence of his other colleagues is a clear indication that he does not have their confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked my colleague, to whom I referred, this question: what makes a good Minister and what makes a bad Minister? What is the difference between a Minister who is successful and a Minister who is a failure? He said, `A good Minister is able to stand up to his department. A good Minister requires his department to perform. A good Minister always keeps his department under scrutiny'. Senator Collins's explanation for this matter, as honourable senators will be well aware by now, is that he had a lot of other documents crossing his desk. When Senator Alston was discussing Senator Collins's manifest failures, the interjection came, `Look, you come and see the paperwork in my office and I'll make you Minister for a day'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though the determination that Senator Collins signed was any one of a number of determinations; it is not as though it was one of a whole heap of letters he may have signed to new enrollees in his electorate.

It was not one of a number of documents; it was one of the most important documents that Senator Collins would sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if it were just one of the other documents, it is interesting to note that Senator Collins has for a long time in this chamber, and outside this chamber, prided himself on the job that he did as Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. He did a very good job. One of the reasons why he did a very good job was that he ensured that the delegated instruments were properly made. He ensured that the delegated legislation that was made was absolutely and thoroughly put together. He had a hallmark for being a person very attentive to the documents. Yet, when he deals with the most important document that will cross his desk as a Minister, what does he do? He just signs it and does not even think to ask what has happened to the deposit. </PARA>

But what we are not going to hear from Senator Collins is the truth: that Senator Collins, as the Minister, bears the responsibility for this failure; that Senator Collins, as the Minister, does not have the integrity to say, `Yes, I am responsible for this stuff-up and a series of stuff-ups'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne said that, in her opinion, we need some ministerial continuity. That assumes that the Minister's track record to date has been one that obliges some degree of confidence in his ability to continue to perform the job. In looking at Senator Collins's degree of competence and at how well his track record stands up to scrutiny, we should remember that his big boast when he became a Minister was, `If I can't get waterfront reform right in the space of 12 months, I will resign'. On national television he said, `I'll resign if I can't fix the waterfront in 12 months'. Just this week we received a report showing that the cost of loading a 20-foot container in Melbourne has fallen just $4.24 in the space of the two-plus years that Senator Collins had to fix the waterfront.

Certainly, one can endorse the high qualities of the man who put the report together. One can naturally assume that he has brought a fair mind to this process. But having read the report carefully and having looked at the material which is published in that report, I think that equally fair-minded people could reach very different conclusions from those reached in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are faced with a problem of probably the greatest bungle in electronic media policy making in this country since the introduction of TV in 1956. I have listened to Senator Collins and Senator Bourne, and I find it hard to believe that no-one appears to have been responsible for this incident. The Minister does not appear to have been responsible. The department seems to have made an error of judgment. The Minister's staff seem to have been completely exonerated of any suggestion of careless work. From Senator Bourne's comments, we can see that she does not seem to feel that the Minister has any particular responsibility for the administration of his department. In her opinion, the Minister has been the victim of a malicious and conniving department which wants to put forward its own views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this report is the type of inquiry which was established by the Minister. It was a private inquiry, at which the evidence was taken in confidence and no transcripts were made. As a result, we have to rely entirely on the interpretations&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the interpretations that Professor Pearce has placed on the material which has been given to him. I express my serious concern&mdash;and raise this in the hope that the Australian Democrats will reflect on their position on this particular issue&mdash;at the fact that when we have an inquiry with excessively narrow terms of reference, where the hearings are taken in camera and where, even at the end of this inquiry, we cannot get hold of the transcripts and all the material which was presented to that inquiry, this inquiry itself is in that sense flawed. I believe we need a proper inquiry into the bungles which have constantly surrounded the administration of this Minister in the area of pay TV.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the evidence that is published in this report, one can come to very different conclusions. For example, as Senator Cooney related, Professor Pearce came to the conclusion in paragraph 55 that the inquiry had not revealed any systemic deficiency in the department's practices, nor had it revealed a general want of capability in any officers of the department. What we saw in a sense, as Professor Pearce said, was simply an error of judgment. I put to the Minister that this report shows a department with very shabby and very careless practices. One only has to turn to paragraph 15, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commenced the inquiry by examining the relevant departmental files. It could not be said that these were in as good a state of presentation as one normally expects from departmental files.</PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate and understand this explanation. However, it has made my task more difficult in that it has obliged officers to rely very often on their memory for what was and was not discussed on various occasions, particularly at meetings.</PARA>
<PARA>Then the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, it is not surprising that my questions have often elicited an `I cannot recall' response.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is writ large&mdash;the Minister should read paragraphs 15 and 16 about the paperwork of the department. Then we go on to find out how the particular determination, which in the end has caused all this trouble for the Minister, was drafted. Professor Pearce apparently has the original document, and in paragraph 21 he states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The origin of this document and its status are not entirely clear.</PARA>
<PARA>Great paperwork by a well-run department!  When one goes through this document one finds on every page prize examples of departmental failure and sloppy paperwork. Then we get to the Minister's office&mdash;no wonder the department is so sloppy because the Minister's office is so sloppy in its paperwork. Senator Collins should have a look at paragraph 29, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minute was hand delivered to the Minister's office on 4 January 1993. It was not logged-in in the normal fashion. However, if standard practice was followed, it would have been sent to the Minister's Darwin office. However, I am informed that there is no record of this having occurred and the document cannot at present be found.</PARA>
<PARA>What great paperwork and great office work! The paragraph continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It thus appears there is no certainty that it was ever placed before the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>We have here an example of the department being unable to find the actual basis on which the original determination was drafted. This determination went through various drafts, but when the department looked back and tried to check its origin it found it very difficult to find who drafted it and where. The document then appeared in the Minister's office and was not logged in. But we then find that the document was read by one of the Minister's staffers. That staffer apparently gave the document to the Minister and said it was okay to sign. </PARA>

Recognising that pay TV is a matter of high public interest, an area in which major players from the media are involved and an area of considerable interest to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, what would a Minister exercising normal ministerial responsibilities have done? I will tell the Senate what that Minister should have done. If the Minister was not happy with the briefing he was given he should have called over the officers of his department and asked to be taken very carefully through the particular document. But, of course, the Minister did not do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really focuses on the role of the Minister and his role in dealing with important bits of paper which pass over his desk. This is where I profoundly differ with the emphasis of Senator Bourne's speech. I believe the Minister cannot be absolved from responsibility in this area. When documents of high public controversy pass over his desk, the Minister has a key responsibility to satisfy himself that the document is sound in every respect. That is what the Minister failed to do. That is why I believe Professor Pearce said at the start of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it should be observed that the Terms of Reference do not require me to comment on issues arising from the doctrine of ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope Professor Pearce notes that immediately this report was brought down the Minister tried to use it to absolve himself of any blame in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of great seriousness; it is not trivial. I believe that the final determination in this area will have quite a profound effect on the doctrine of ministerial responsibility in this country. It will also go to the heart of what particular role a department has and what actions should be taken in a department which has clearly failed, I believe, in a number of key areas. There is nothing in the Pearce report which shows that any action will be taken in the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the months to come I will be interested to inquire at the Senate estimates committees how many of the officers in this department received performance-based pay bonuses. That will be a very interesting exercise. It will be interesting to get the Minister's answer as to whether the senior officers in this department, whose paperwork was so sloppy and who&mdash;at least in Professor Pearce's own words&mdash;were responsible for a major error of judgment, receive these very generous performance-based pay rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is a very important report. It should be very extensively debated and considered in this Parliament.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They relate only to the department. The terms of reference say, `Was the advice by the department sufficient to alert the Minister?'  There is nothing about the Minister's responsibility&mdash;and I will come to that in a minute. If these terms of reference had included a No. 6, `Did the Minister act in a responsible manner?', then this report would have had something to do with whether or not the Minister was responsible and could have absolved the Minister from responsibility. But they did not, and Senator Collins cannot claim that he is absolved by this report. The basic flaw was in the terms of reference. That is underlined by Professor Pearce when he states in the report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not seek an amendment to the Terms of Reference, noting their narrow compass and the short period for completion of the inquiry (it should be observed that the Terms of Reference do not require me to comment on issues arising from the doctrine of ministerial responsibility).</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Pearce specifically says that he has nothing to do with the Minister's responsibility in this matter, only with the department's responsibility. The Minister has been very critical of the Opposition criticising this report in any way and says that, because we do, we are criticising Professor Pearce. That is not true, and the Minister really cannot get away with that. Bearing in mind that we cannot look at the Minister's responsibility, that we can only look at the department's responsibility, let us see whether we agree with some of the evidence that Professor Pearce has put before us. He starts off by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commenced the inquiry by examining the relevant departmental files.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleague has quoted some of this, but I would like to quote a bit more. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could not be said these were in as good a state of presentation as one normally expects from departmental files. Papers do not always appear chronologically, folios are not always numbered and officers who have accessed them have not so indicated on the file cover. It is also to be observed that notes have not always been made of the outcome of meetings. These deficiencies were explained as flowing from the extraordinary pressure under which the officers of the Department were working in bringing the . . . scheme to fruition . . . senior officers were required to work very long hours.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Pearce goes on making excuses for the officers because they were under pressure. That is never an excuse; it can never be considered an excuse for inefficiency. Regularly in this place, officers are under pressure. Regularly in this place, people work long hours. We senators work long hours and, indeed, our all night sittings do not absolve us from responsibility. Just because one is tired does not mean that one absolves oneself from all responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Pearce went on to say, `I appreciate and understand this explanation' that everyone was so tired. He does not say that, but that is what he was talking about. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it has made my task more difficult in that it has obliged officers to rely very often on their memory . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Lovely, is it not? No notes, no efficiency; just, `I think, perhaps, I am not quite sure'. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The events in question occurred five or six months ago and at that time when the officers were weary and were in many cases about to go on leave. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that my questions have often elicited an `I cannot recall' response.</PARA>
<PARA>An efficient department and an efficient office of the Minister said, `We were all too tired; about to go on leave; it's been a gruelling session; we didn't write it down; we didn't do it efficiently; we didn't make the necessary notes; we didn't indicate what occurred at the meetings; and we can't remember&mdash;we can't recall'. Professor Pearce said that he had received full cooperation from the Minister's staff, but they could not remember. He believed, quite legitimately, that they could not remember. They were not efficient, they had not written down a thing&mdash;how could they remember something that happened six months earlier? He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal advice as to the validity of the proposed scheme was sought from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to matters that were going on about that time, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a document was circulating within the Department that appears to be either a draft Determination or a draft Information Memorandum. This document includes the statement that tenderers for a pay-TV licence `are not required to pay a deposit to enter the process'. The origin of this document and its status are not entirely clear.</PARA>
<PARA>Nobody could remember. On page 9 of the report Professor Pearce says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find this surprising as a deposit system is applicable to the sale of . . . MDS licences . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it was applicable then, but nobody thought about it with regard to the pay TV licence. We go on and find that the senior officers had a meeting in December and there were changes to the determination arising from that meeting. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He deals with the urgency surrounding this. The officers of the department wanted it all done before the election. Professor Pearce says that the urgency was one of the problems of the mess-up. The urgency was because they wanted it done prior to the election. He said that they sent the determination off to the Attorney-General's Department and two senior officers of the Minister's department believed&mdash;assumed&mdash;that it would go to the Office of Commercial Law within the Attorney-General's Department. Professor Pearce says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would have been prudent for the Department of Transport and Communications to have checked whether the Office of Commercial Law had been consulted. . . </PARA>
<PARA>But it did not. The department took it for granted&mdash;good, efficient stuff! As has been said before, the draft determination was delivered to the Minister's office under cover of a minute dated 4 January. The report states:</PARA>

Is there anything in this that could create a problem?'. Every Minister does this, or should. I remind Senator Lees, who is here at the moment, that that is what Senator Collins thinks, too, because on a censure motion on cost overruns on the wharf, he said:</PARA>

I want brief myself on that. It is my responsibility'. Those were the words that the Minister used. I would not use them. I would say to my staff or my department, `What is in this that could cause me problems? What is controversial? Brief me.' The Minister did not do that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his concluding remarks, Professor Pearce says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that, having regard to the sensitivity of the tendering process in relation to pay-TV licences, it would have been appropriate for the Minister to have been given a fuller briefing on the way in which it was to operate. That this was not done was a product of a number of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say such things as that it needed to be done quickly because they wanted it fixed up before the election; that they had just finished a gruelling period in parliament; that they were tired, and that people were on holidays. Let me just tell the Minister, because I think it is pretty important, that no other profession could ever get away with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My husband was an obstetrician and gynaecologist. He may have been up all night doing deliveries, but he would come home, get dressed and then go back to his office. He is not absolved of any responsibility towards the first patient he sees just because he is tired. He is not absolved of any responsibility if he has a new sister assisting him. He is not absolved of any responsibility because he has had a gruelling year and has been working for six months with only one day off. This Minister would not know what work was. If he talked about two years without a day off he might be talking about something more applicable, but to whinge in here that he was tired and had had only one day off in six months is not something that I would be proud of if I were him. He would not know what work was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again the excuse was that the Minister had been in the portfolio only a short time and was the fourth incumbent in a period of two months. Being a new Minister is no excuse not to accept responsibility and say, `The buck stops with me'. When a medico sees a patient he does not have an excuse if he is new and he is tired&mdash;or, as in this case, if it is Christmas Eve and there is an election coming up. These are the excuses that this Minister has been using in the Senate. He accepts the money and, as he himself says, `If you accept the money, then you must accept the responsibility'. That is no less than the Senate accepts, and expects of any Minister in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very limited report. I reiterate the remarks of my colleagues on this side of the chamber in saying that Professor Pearce points out on the first page of his report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it should be observed that the Terms of Reference do not require me to comment on issues arising from the doctrine of ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, that question remains to be tested. To my mind, there are several questions to which the Senate requires answers that are not canvassed at all in this report and were not required to be canvassed by the terms of reference. It seems to me that the proper vehicle for doing this is a Senate committee of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the points that I think need to be traversed. The judgment in the Australian Capital Equity Pty Ltd case sets out the details of the determination that was made for the tender process for MDS licences. It sets out that one determination was made on 1 October 1992, in advance of the power conferred by section 92A of the Broadcasting Services Act, which was conferred on 5 October. It then cites section 92A of the Act:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of subsection 92A(1) of the Act, a licence granted under the Act for a multi-point distribution station referred to in column 2 and described in column 3 of item 66 in schedule 1 is a licence of a kind for which the Minister may determine a price-based allocation system.</PARA>
<PARA>On 9 December 1992, a press notice invited tenders to be submitted for those licences. It was called a price-based allocation. On 7 January 1993, the Minister in writing revoked the determination made in October 1992, known as determination No. 1, and at the same time, under the heading `Radiocommunications: Allocation of multi-point distribution system licences', determination No. 2, determined another tender-based allocation system for granting multi-point distribution station licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then sets out the terms of the tender. Those terms are remarkably similar to the terms of tender set out in the price-based tender system for satellite licences. The only difference is that clause 5 states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Any tender made to the Secretary must:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)be in writing,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)be in a sealed envelope, and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)contain a deposit of five per cent of the amount bid.</PARA>
<PARA>The clause then goes on to provide that any tender not accompanied by the deposit would not be a valid tender. This particular tender for MDS licences is price-based. It contained the five per cent deposit. The questions that need to be asked are these: who were the people who drew up the determination for the Minister to sign on 7 January 1993? What processes did they go through to determine that there needed to be a deposit paid on that occasion&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SE4">Senator BISHOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With MDS licences. We need to know who determined that a price-based system was properly set out and consistent with having a five per cent deposit paid. What was it that changed people's minds when it came to satellite licences?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 93 of the Act states not that the Minister may have a price-based system but that the Minister shall have a price-based system. In the first case, for MDS licences, the Minister elected to have a price-based system and had a five per cent deposit. In the case of the satellite licences, the Minister had no such option; he was required by the Parliament to have a price-based system. Precedent would have dictated that a five per cent deposit would be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read Professor Pearce's report, I read that, basically, the substance of the determination was decided on 24 December 1992. When I look at the judgment in the MDS case I note that on 23 December, that is, the day before, the notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> under the heading of `Invitations to tender' contained the price-based tender application concerning MDS licences. In other words, discussion of these two tenders was going on simultaneously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is it about the Minister's office that had officers deciding that for MDS licences a five per cent deposit was to be paid, but in respect of satellite licences there was to be no deposit? Professor Pearce says at paragraph 25 of his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The officers attending these meetings in December&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the meetings that took place between 17 and 24 December 1992&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">said that the requirement of payment of a deposit was not discussed.</PARA>
<PARA>How can that be so, when at the same time the Minister had in his office a similar tender process which required such a deposit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Pearce then goes on to say that the officers discussed the desirability of imposing a fee. They also noted that a fee could not exceed the cost of processing. Later in the report, it is said that the $500 fee would only be a small part of the cost of processing such an application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Term of reference No. 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What were the reasons for the non-inclusion in that draft Determination of deposit requirements for the tendering process?</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 32, which is cited often through the report, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All officers of the Department who were involved in the policy discussions relating to the Determination were asked this question.</PARA>
<PARA>Why did some officers decide that there would be no deposit for satellite licences? Presumably they must have been talking to the same officers who determined that the MDS system had to have a deposit. Yet they say they did not discuss the question of a deposit with regard to satellite licences. That makes no sense to me, particularly when paragraph 32 further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responses were numerous and varied.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Pearce then sets out nine of them. Six out of the nine mention a deposit requirement. How is it that on 23 December the Minister's department published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> a price based system requiring a deposit, with the determination to be settled on 7 January, and that on 24 December the same department said that it did not even discuss the question of a deposit, yet it had settled what was to go into the determination?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to paragraph 21 of the report. There is a curious series of events whereby it is said that a document was circulating in the department, which seems to have been in the department since about mid-November. Paragraph 21 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is not possible to be more precise about the time&mdash;a document was circulating within the Department that appears to be either a draft Determination or a draft Information Memorandum. This document includes the statement that tenderers for a pay-TV licence `are not required to pay a deposit to enter the process'.</PARA>
<PARA>Some discussion had to have gone on, bearing in mind that the question of both the MDS licences and the satellite licences were all on the agenda from the beginning of October in the Minister's department, were in evidence before courts and are now mentioned in reports. Paragraph 21 continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The origin of this document and its status are not entirely clear.</PARA>
<PARA>Why is it not clear? It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to have been drafted within the Broadcasting Review and Pay-TV Section, Development and Planning Branch, Broadcasting Policy Division, of the Department. It was then sent to the Legal and General Branch to be drafted in the form of a Determination. Legal Branch declined to do this. . . </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go further into the report we find that that course of action was followed, but the draft was sent off to the Attorney-General's Department and addressed to the secretary. Officers then said that they presumed someone from the commercial section would give some legal advice, but it did not take place. Only the drafting people looked at it. Why is that so? If there was a presumption that it was sent in that form, why did nobody follow it up? Why did nobody ask for the legal opinion if that is what they anticipated should happen? The report states in paragraph 26:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two senior officers in the Department . . . thought that the draft Determination would be reviewed by the Office of Commercial Law within the Attorney-General's Department as a result of it being sent to the Secretary.</PARA>

<PARA>Why? Why did the officers who sent it on for what they thought was some appraisal not follow it up? The report states that it was marked urgent but contained no request for general advice. In other words, people are saying, `We thought they would have a look at it and give us advice, but we did not ask for any'. Why not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, what procedure was followed with regard to the MDS licences? Presumably there had been discussion about why it was thought proper to have a five per cent deposit for the MDS licences; it was felt correct that this was the formula to be followed. If one looks at FM licences which occurred in an earlier period, one finds that a $10,000 deposit was required even for those licences, as distinct from a fee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was $10,000 for the FM licences and I will cite the documents, but the Minister can have his turn in a moment. The other matter of significance is shown in paragraph 28 of the report which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An officer of the Office of Legislative Drafting did suggest a number of changes of an essentially drafting nature to the Department of Transport and Communications and a new version of the Determination incorporating these changes was prepared. This version&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the one which was altered by the Office of Legislative Drafting in the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was submitted&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I stress, `submitted'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the Minister for his signature on 11 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>The MDS determination was submitted to the Minister for his signature on 7 January. On 7 January he signed an MDS licence tender which required a five per cent deposit. On 11 January&mdash;four days later&mdash;he signed another determination, this time for satellite licences, with a completely different system, that is, a $500 fee and no five per cent deposit. This occurred four days later and the Minister did not ask the question, `Why the difference?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of Professor Pearce's report is that the officer submitted the determination to the Minister and that is precisely what it is. I am often given documents by my staff; the documents are submitted to me for signature. I do not simply sign them. I read them, and if there are things wrong in them that I do not believe are consistent with precedent or the things that I believe are right, I ask about it and have it altered if it is wrong. It is not good enough for me in my office to say that I do not have time to read things and therefore I will just sign them. I do not, and it is not good enough for the Minister to say that either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has signed two competing documents: both price based systems; both for licences in the telecommunications area; one where he has elected to exercise his discretion to use the price based system; and one where the Parliament has said it is mandatory. It is the same system; different terms and conditions&mdash;deposit required in one and not in the other. Why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the terms of reference given to Professor Pearce to investigate these matters are simply too narrow for enough information to be brought before the Senate for anybody to make a proper decision or a proper finding. In this matter it is simply a question of making sure that the taxpayers of Australia get good government. Governments make policy; bureaucrats administer policy. When an Act requires the determination of the Minister, that is exactly what it means. The Minister is charged with the responsibility of making a decision and putting it into practice. It is not the responsibility of the bureaucrat; it is the responsibility of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whereas Professor Pearce concludes at the end of his report that officers in the department made an error of judgment, that is a perfectly proper finding for him to make because he has seen the evidence. But it is irrelevant to the question of whether or not the Minister exercised ministerial responsibility and sufficient care in carrying out the responsibility he was charged with by the legislation which required him to make a determination&mdash;not the bureaucrats to make the determination; the Minister to make the determination. That is the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many more questions need to be answered&mdash;with regard to the precedent that was set and with regard to the people who were involved in both sets of tender documents&mdash;to ascertain why one lot required a five per cent deposit and one lot did not. We simply cannot deduce that there was some general ethos in the department that somehow a five per cent deposit was a hurdle. It clearly was not. There was no consistent view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have not seen is why the difference. We can achieve that only if we have a proper Senate inquiry to adduce all the evidence so that a decision can then be made. The aim at the end of the day is to ensure that Ministers know what ministerial responsibility is about and bureaucrats know what their responsibility is about in terms of administering policy made by executive government. Those are the questions that the Senate ought properly inquire into and get to the bottom of. What flows from the answers to those questions is another issue altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Bourne made some statements earlier today, but I ask the Democrats to look at those questions that I have set out to the Senate in the last 20 minutes. We require answers to them. At the end of the day it is the Senate's responsibility&mdash;the responsibility of all of us who are elected and who are not part of the Executive&mdash;to ensure that taxpayers' money is wisely spent and that we get peace, welfare and good government. A Labor Party backbencher is no more a member of executive government than you or I. It is our responsibility to see that we carry out what we are elected to the Parliament to do. I sincerely believe that on this occasion the best and, indeed, only way that can now be done is to have a Senate committee of inquiry and ascertain all the facts, which are much broader than the terms of reference that were given to Professor Pearce. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some respects, it is quite reassuring to know that a former ombudsman has this view of the world, this compassion, but as a new leader I am very conscious of the whole notion of office administration. Despite Professor Pearce's acceptance of the explanations, I am quite concerned about his findings and the comments he makes regarding departmental files and the way the Minister's office was administered. The Minister himself acknowledged this a couple of weeks ago. This report is quite damning, in my view&mdash;leaving aside the acceptance of the explanations&mdash;of departmental procedures and the Minister's office administration. It begs a couple of questions that I do not think have been raised. Paragraph 15 of Professor Pearce's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in November 1992, senior officers were required to work very long hours, many of them in Parliament House. Adherence to usual public service paper procedures was not possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Ministerial advisers. In the short time that I have been here, many of the ministerial advisers that I have had to deal with often appear to be more political appointments than people who are across the breadth of the policy issues. At paragraph 52, Professor Pearce comments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comparatively recent phenomenon of Ministers having advisers on their staff does not remove this obligation from a Department.</PARA>
<PARA>This obligation is for departmental officers to bring matters of significance to the attention of the Minister. I wonder whether a situation has evolved where so many assumptions are made about what the role of that adviser ought to be that departmental advisers need to think more clearly about whether they are fulfilling their role or whether they are relying on advisers. Despite the fact that advisers may say that they are much more likely to be concerned with political policy issues than process, I wonder whether this delineation remains clear enough. Professor Pearce, at paragraph 54, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the conclusion is inescapable that it was a mistake for the departmental officers not to bring certain aspects of the tendering process to the attention of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this inaction was readily explicable in terms of the circumstances that existed at the time . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find that an error of judgement was made but that is all that it was&mdash;an error of judgement. I find no basis whatsoever for any suggestion that the departmental officers deliberately failed to advise the Minister that the payment of a deposit was not part of the tendering process.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we asked Professor Pearce to look at. That is what he has concluded. I do not believe that there has been any conspiracy in this matter, but I do believe that we should be concerned about the exposure that we have in front of us of lack of due process and lack of due responsibility. I do not believe that that exposure on this matter is sufficient to warrant the resignation of this Minister. We still have an open mind on the matter of an inquiry. As honourable senators would know, we are awaiting the documents on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has got everything to do with it, because it is a matter directly raised by this report. I am pleased that Senator Kernot, alone in this debate so far, has acknowledged that it is a critical report. The human factors are mentioned. But I think it is a fair reading of the document&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Kernot will read it again&mdash;to say that although they are mentioned it is just for the completeness of the report. I do not think there is any excusing by Professor Pearce in nailing it down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without even straining my brain, I can think of three of my advisers who are not even members of the Labor Party. There is no requirement in my office for any of them to be that. I am interested in people who have professional qualifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing about my staff, Senator Kernot, is that most of them have been with me for a very long time. My senior private secretary, Jack Lake, has worked for me on and off for 15 years. He is a very good trained economist. Barbara Jones, who runs my Darwin office, has been with me for almost the same period. My press secretary, Brian Johnstone, has been with me for over 10 years. They are very competent staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I will not allow the problem that occurred in January to occur again. That has been put to rest already. As Senator Kernot has pointed out, I did acknowledge this two weeks ago, and everybody in the Opposition overlooked it. I just wanted to address directly that concern that Senator Kernot raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most disappointing thing about the debate here this afternoon is that, having moved mountains to get this report into the Senate five days ahead of its scheduled time, not a single Opposition member&mdash;and I regret to say that includes Senator Bishop&mdash;has clearly even bothered to read it. What those opposite have done is pick out the paragraphs that suit them and skip the ones that do not. I will give the Senate one glaring example of this from the speech made by Senator Bishop, and it was disgraceful. Have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tomorrow to confirm whether this is right or wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop quoted from paragraph 26 of the Pearce report. I might add that the reason I immediately recognised this is that I happen to think this is one of the most serious errors that were made, and I want to talk about that. She then went on to say, `Professor Pearce says nothing about that. He doesn't say why it happened or anything else'. Have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tomorrow. She then skipped straight from paragraph 26 to paragraph 28. She actually said, `I will go to paragraph 28'. She left out paragraph 27&mdash;she went straight across it. The reason she left it out is that it does not suit her argument. This is one of the most serious errors that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Pearce makes a highly critical statement in the report about this assumption that the commercial law section was involved. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assumption that the draft Determination would be considered by other sections of Attorney-General's Department in addition to the Office of Legislative Drafting when it was addressed in the manner . . . was not well founded.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a highly critical statement. But Senator Bishop conveniently skipped across that paragraph. The facts are&mdash;and it is very disappointing&mdash;that after the criticism of the past three weeks about Ministers who do not sit down and read every line contained in determinations, when I finally get the umpire's verdict&mdash;and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will clearly show this&mdash;not a single Opposition member, from Senator Alston down to Senator Bishop, bothers to read it. They just pull the paragraphs out that suit them and skip across the paragraphs that do not suit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to paragraph 27 which Senator Bishop left out and make a few comments. I said a couple of weeks ago&mdash;and I have turned out to be right&mdash;that in my view the real cause of this very serious problem could probably be likened to an aircraft accident. I said half jokingly that I should have had the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation look at this matter, and I will tell the Senate why. They are system experts and they really know their stuff. Major airline accidents have always got one thing in common. A series of events occur, and fortunately it happens rarely, each one of which does not seem to be a major problem at the time but because they occur together a disaster results. Honourable senators should read this report. Senator Kernot was right to say that it is highly critical, but only for anyone who has bothered to read all of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this report points out clearly is that a whole series of errors occurred. The report, quite unblushingly, gives the reasons for those errors&mdash;which I find unsatisfactory as does Professor Pearce. That is why they are outlined in the report. Professor Pearce makes a highly critical comment that these assertions `were not well founded'. Senator Bishop skipped over this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has indicated that a whole lot of errors did occur, which at the time did not seem to be major problems to the officers. If I wanted to single one out, and I do, it is the very issue that Senator Bishop tried to skip over. What appeared to me to be a serious error in this matter, from my end of it, was that it was clear that the officers had conscientiously and carefully attempted to implement the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Kernot to look at the Attorney-General's advice and the clues in there and it will be found that this was the department's `preferred position'. The officers had laid down all these hurdles and they had sent them off to the Attorney-General's Department. Have a look at the hurdles, one of which was to have a look at the viability of the company. The department sent a letter back saying, `You can't do any of this'. The letter did not say, `You can't put a deposit on', but it said, `You can't put any of these conditions on'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then happened&mdash;and this is pure speculation on my part, but I publicly speculated about it&mdash;in terms of the succession of errors, was that the officers, as Professor Pearce sets out in the report, then sent their readjusted model to the Attorney-General's Department. There was an assumption made that the commercial law section of the department looked at it, and it did not. Professor Pearce, in a very critical comment, said, `That was not a well founded assumption'. But every senator on the other side of the chamber has ignored that. It is a very important omission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believed all along that what would be found at the end of the day was that these officers conscientiously went about delivering the Government's policy&mdash;or Parliament's policy. In fact, the Opposition wanted to go further than we were going to go with it. The officers clearly got the determination checked by the Attorney-General's Department for completeness. They had an officer from DITAC working with them who attended to all the industry matters, which were done very well and properly done. They sent it off to the Attorney-General's Department and they assumed that it was going to commercial scrutiny. What has been obvious to me from day one is that it did not get that commercial scrutiny. That is a serious error in hindsight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to tell the Senate what has been done about it since by the secretary of the department, and I will table these documents. Since this happened, it is not intended&mdash;and this is contained, as Senator Alston knows, in the Broadcast Services Act&mdash;for the department to have much of an ongoing role now in tender processes. The Spectrum Management Agency is going to take over all the spectrum management tenders, and it was always intended that the ABA should handle all the future licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite that, the secretary to the department has appointed to the staff of DOTAC two commercial lawyers from the commercial law section of the Attorney-General's legal practice. They are now working full-time for DOTAC. The secretary has already recognised that this was a flaw. Professor Pearce is highly critical of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the motion, add ", but the Senate is of the opinion that the retention in legislation of any time limit sends the wrong signals to an uncertain wool market".</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to extend the wool debt repayment schedule from seven years to eight years. Honourable senators may remember that when the commission was established in 1991 it inherited a $2.7 billion debt and a 4.6 million bale stockpile, and was given seven years to repay the debt and dispose of the stockpile. However, a lack of buyers and a downturn in wool prices prompted industry fears that the Wool Realisation Commission would be forced into a fire sale of the stockpile wool. The Federal Government responded by promising to extend the repayment program from seven years to eight years, meaning that no wool would have to be sold from the stockpile next year and the Government could determine repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Federal coalition welcomes the extension, we believe that the strict debt reduction schedule should be abolished, thereby reassuring a still uncertain market that there will be no fire sale. The fact that this Bill is before us underscores the plight of the wool industry from the woolgrowers, their families and their communities all the way up to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures speak for themselves. Last year, the loss to the average woolgrower business was nearly $40,000; this year it will be close to $34,000; next year, ABARE says, it will be over $34,000; in other words, an average of $107,000 in just three years. Even worse, the slide in property values has reduced equity and, in so doing, reduced the capacity of many woolgrowers to demonstrate viability, thereby making it harder for them to borrow and harder to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that Australia's total rural debt has blown out from $10.6 billion in 1987 to $15.6 billion last year, and it is still climbing despite the drop in interest rates. This debt, assuming an average rate of 14 per cent after bank and other charges, means that the total farm interest bill is just over $2 billion a year. That is more than the total net farm value of farm production this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complicating matters is the fact that the current stockpile of 3.9 million bales has barely shifted in the last nine months and continues to hang over the industry. The wool pipeline is full. So full, in fact, that wool is being held in brokers' or buyers' sheds around the country and in various forms at other points in the pipeline. Over the years wool has lost market share to cotton and synthetics, declining from some 10 per cent of the total market share for fibre in 1950-51 to just 4.4 per cent of an admittedly larger market in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the years of the reserve price scheme, particularly towards the end, production was encouraged by the relative security of the industry and the prices that farmers felt they would receive for their product. The Australian sheep population hit a high of 173 million in 1990. With improved productivity in the industry and the higher fleece weights, on average, production soared to unprecedented levels. However, last year total sheep numbers fell to 151 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of encroaching debt and relatively low prices, farmers are voluntarily making difficult decisions about off-loading, not breeding or even contracting numbers. The forecast total production figure for greasy wool this year is 851 million kilograms, while next year the figure is expected to come down to 805 million&mdash;still above the long-term average. Some estimates put it as low as 700 million kilograms. Fortunately, this provides scope for wool to be sold from the stockpile, without depressing sales, through the auction system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal coalition believes that the Federal Government could and should do more for the wool industry. For example, the Federal Government could slacken the strings controlling the Australian Wool Realisation Commission and give it more flexibility to go out and market stockpile wool. It could also remove the transparency in the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's operations so that buyers do not know how much the commission is selling or at what price and, by virtue of these two factors, what their competitors are up to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By not abandoning the debt repayment schedule, the Federal Government has lost an important opportunity to reassure the market and instil much-needed confidence. Instead, the Federal Government has chosen to extend the repayment deadline. While this extension acknowledges the difficulties facing the industry, it also risks a burst in market confidence, followed by an even greater uncertainty in 12 months time. Ironically, the sooner we can restore confidence, the sooner prices are likely to recover, and the faster the debt can be repaid. Growers have a vested interest in the rapid repayment of the debt because they are stuck with the costs of servicing the debt and stockpiling the wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the shadow Minister for primary industry, Mr John Anderson, I welcome the Federal Government's offer of $50 million for interest rate subsidies under the exceptional circumstances provision of the RAS. However, is it enough? As I mentioned earlier, Australia's farm debt is now a staggering $15.6 billion, and interest payments on that debt amount to around $2 billion a year. If the new interest rate subsidies reach every woolgrower, and it is estimated that about 90 per cent need them, the subsidies will be worth only $1,000 a farmer&mdash;a paltry figure, considering the generosity displayed by this Federal Labor Government to waterside workers, the better cities program and, as we have seen in recent days in documents before the Senate, specifically and directly to the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government also talks about helping farmers meet world best practice. It is important to remind the Government that the Australian broadacre farm sector is one of the most productive in the world and that its productivity improvements should be regarded as a model by the rest of the community, and indeed by the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farm sector has a record of which it can be extremely proud. However, I would like to draw to the attention of honourable senators one of the most fundamental issues facing the sector&mdash;that is, the lack of profitability and its potential to hold back any future productivity gains. The Federal Government continues to sidestep the fact that taxes on farming inputs amount to a three to five per cent penalty in our international competitiveness. It is an issue that the Government must confront, not simply in international trade competitiveness but in our capacity to hold at bay imports from countries such as New Zealand. No business can consistently afford to give its competitors that sort of advantage. The reality is that a Federal coalition government would have removed this burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Treasury figures, farm sector inputs are taxed at over $1 billion; another $1.3 billion dollars is levied in the food processing sector; and the Australian farm pays about $8,000 in cost inputs resulting from non-rebatable tax costs on production. In the light of these figures, the Federal coalition pleads with the Federal Government to ensure the survival of the farm sector both for the people involved and, indeed, for the nation. I trust that the Government will address the many structural issues shackling the farm sector and finally give it the opportunity to operate in a long-term, internationally competitive environment. </PARA>

That does not mean that we necessarily agree with the intent of this legislation&mdash;in fact, that is why Senator Tambling has moved an amendment&mdash;nor do we agree that the legislation can provide the results which we believe are essential at this time for the wool sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does no more than re-arrange, by delaying, the debt repayment program. It is no more than a short-sighted delaying action when the Government should be tackling the big picture of debt repayment scheduling. While, obviously, growers and the industry in general will in part welcome the payment extension from seven to eight years that is delivered by this legislation, it is not an answer to the problems, and that is equally recognised by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being grateful for being handed small mercies is no solution to the stress the industry is feeling. But the passage of this Bill is necessary, despite its massive deficiencies, as a stopgap. The coalition is, therefore, in a catch-22 situation. If we do not support the Bill, the repayment time frame will remain at seven years. Supporting the legislation is the least damaging alternative of two not very practical options. The coalition's view remains that the strict debt repayment schedule should be abolished if the wool industry is to regain any confidence and surety in its dealings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point covering old ground tonight about the destructive decisions which led to the borrowing, which left us with $2.3 billion dollars worth of debt on the part of growers and the debilitating wool stockpile. These have been debated ad nauseam and it is to be hoped that responsibility has now been accepted by those involved. I simply remind the present Minister that as long ago as August 1989, when everything still appeared rosy, I warned the Government in a question to the then Minister, Senator Button, of gathering storm clouds. Sadly, that warning was ignored. However, beyond that experience of recent years relating to the collapse of the reserve price scheme, successive governments have, over many years, brought the industry to its present financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said numerous times in this Parliament, the interrelated mechanisms of tariff protection and centralised wage fixing have for most of this century caused a transfer of incomes, savings and wealth from farmers and miners in general, and woolgrowers in particular, to urban industries, their owners and employees. One consequence of that is that woolgrowers do not now have the store of savings which would otherwise be available to them to tide them over the current crisis. This has been made worse by this Labor Government's failure to have an adequate IED scheme operating in more recent years. Another consequence is that it raises the question of justice and equity in the face of any criticism of suggestions of taxpayer-funded assistance for woolgrowers in their present difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As colleagues would well recognise, I am the last person to advocate subsidies for any group, especially of a sort that would hide future market realities from producers and encourage uneconomic production. However, provided long-term viability is encouraged, assistance for woolgrowers in the current circumstances could be seen as quite fair and simply repayment for the subsidy the wool industry has provided to the urban community for some 90 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If such assistance is to be provided, it must be directed towards the future health of the industry, and the focus for that must be on better marketing. Achieving that is in turn dependent on getting agreement&mdash;which at present does not seem to exist within the industry&mdash;on how it should: firstly, develop new markets; secondly, consolidate its present market position both at home and overseas; thirdly, be responsive to global needs by being active rather than reactive; fourthly, address through organised grower education the clearly stated overseas concerns about our inconsistent wool quality; and, fifthly, run an effective marketing campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crisis caused by past soaring wool prices, the debt past decisions created and the stockpile have masked these other concerns and goals, which must be addressed just as urgently. We cannot negotiate a global strategy for the Australian wool industry until we deal with quality control, marketing and, crucially, identify new markets for the commodity at the same time as we are negotiating how to deal with the stockpile and the debt repayment. This is no time to be submerged totally in the crisis management of the debt and the stockpile, although finding the correct solution to the stockpile problem is of paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will always be a strong market for our top quality wool at the exclusive end of global garment manufacturing and designer fashion. This is, of course, the creme de la creme of the industry, but not our bread and butter. Wool of lesser quality is on a steady and, many say, irreversible decline globally for use in clothing. This has been created mainly by changing lifestyles, airconditioned offices and homes and economic factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perceived that wool costs more, takes more care and time to look after and does not have the resilience and longevity of man-made fibres. A lack of awareness of cool wool has continued the perception that wool is too warm to wear most of the year and inside. This was identified and stated quite clearly by the International Wool Secretariat more than two years ago. Barely a month goes by without information being released to the media about new man-made fibres which are seen as a replacement for wool in mid and lower price range garment manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While marketing can hold back the tide of change to some extent, it is definitely time to look for new markets away from clothes, especially away from mid-range clothing. We must also face up to the fact that our local wool advertising campaigns have not been the success that we would have hoped. The `Get real, get wool' campaign, which we are told cost a small fortune to produce, received accolades from the advertising industry but made little impact on consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are apparently now about to see a campaign which uses the elderly to explain to the young the benefits of wool. I am sure that we will be watching with interest for reports on this campaign's effectiveness. I am informed that the theory behind it relates to the younger generation apparently being willing to take advice from grandparents but not from parents. It is the young who are targeted because of IWS research which indicates that they have no fibre knowledge and as little interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting marketing concept, but can it sell wool? The bottom line is that, if our home-grown advertising cannot increase sales in Australia, what hope do we have overseas? We have a major problem when all the available research shows that, while consumers recognise the Woolmark label, they have no idea what it actually means. We need effective advertising if we are to increase interest and knowledge, let alone sales, just as we need consistent quality of the product if we are to be trusted overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of quality, if we wish to be a global market force, we cannot treat wool any differently from the way we treat motor vehicle components, for example. They have to be above Australian standard to be accepted overseas. We are showing in that industry that we can do it, and I believe that, equally, we can do it in the wool industry. We cannot sit and chew grass in contemplation and say that wool is any different. As long as some see wool as being different, it will not attain the consistent quality essential for global market acceptance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all familiar with what the British company Marks and Spencers thinks of our wool. It says that the best is brilliant, but that it can just as often be dreadful. That is a damming indictment for a country which made its international trade name with wool. We must educate and educate and educate our growers to ensure that inferior quality wool is never allowed to leave Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue which must be addressed is the cost of production for growers. This is a direct government responsibility and relates to my earlier remarks regarding the many years of income transfer from woolgrowers to others. At long last, the costly burden of tariffs is being lifted from the woolgrowers' weary backs. But this Labor Government, beholden to its union mates, continues to allow archaic industrial relations arrangements to persist, which reduce productivity and therefore increase production costs throughout Australia. This detrimentally affects woolgrowers' indirect costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More direct are the specific industrial relations practices in the shearing industry which reduce efficiency and increase costs. On top of that, woolgrowers have to suffer the continuing rorts and inefficiencies in the transport chain in moving their wool to the final users, that is, unnecessarily high costs in land transport, at the waterfront and in shipping. They also have to bear the burden of a high level of input taxes, which the coalition would have removed had we now been in government and which was referred to a few moments ago by my colleague Senator Tambling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government continues to drag the chain on all these essential reforms. If this sounds like I am digressing from the legislation, far from it; these are simply examples of how we are failing to look at the big picture. As long as we do so, the wool crisis will stay exactly that&mdash;a major crisis. This legislation is no different. It is a bandaid and nothing more. The coalition, therefore, refuses to do more than simply allow its passage. To do anything else in the current circumstances would be to make the problem worse. However, I conclude by making the point strongly that answering the difficulties with non-solutions is a pathetic way for a government to go about its business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993. In order to fit in with Senator Evans's new-found interest in declarations of interest, I declare my interest as a woolgrower.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Realisation Commission was established during 1991-92 for the sole purpose of eventually paying off the debt which remained after the collapse of the reserve price scheme. On its establishment, the AWRC inherited a debt of $2.7 billion and a stockpile of 4.6 million bales. During 1991-92 the AWRC sold 538,000-odd bales, valued at $331 million. During the first half of the following year, 1992-93, the AWRC sold only 98,000-odd bales, worth $58 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, sales from the stockpile have virtually ceased, with stockpile sales for the season to 30 April totalling 110,000 bales, worth in the vicinity of $58 million. During 1991-92, storage costs were approximately $26 million and interest charges were $258 million. On a per bale basis this is $8 for storage and approximately $60 for interest. As per the AWRC's inventory, the value of the stockpile at the end of 1991-92 totalled $2.4 billion, or approximately $585 per bale. I do not think the value of the wool in the stockpile would be anywhere near that figure because, besides the fact that we have a debt, the stockpile is deteriorating. The wool is losing its springiness due to double dumping. In addition, it is losing its yolk and is being stained by the steel bands around the bales, which are rusting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of this Bill is the Government's original request that the AWRC meet a minimum schedule of repayments over seven years. This was later replaced, at the industry's urging, with a cumulative debt reduction scheme, which provided for a maximum outstanding debt at the end of each year of the program as follows: in 1992, $2,698 million&mdash;in other words, $2.69 billion; in 1993, $2.398 billion; in 1994, $1.998 billion; in 1995, $1.498 billion; in 1996, $948 million; in 1997, $398 million; and then by 1998 it would go to zero. That is the position we were in. Now, with the serious problems that the Australian wool industry has, this Government, after much pressure, has decided to bring in this Bill which simply extends the repayment by one year, and one year only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the other points that need to be raised have been made by other speakers. In my remaining time, I would like to explode a few myths about the wool industry in Australia today. I read a very interesting article by Henry Haszler, an economist with 25 years experience from Latrobe University. Some of his comments certainly are in line with my philosophy on the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to challenge the fairly common view that `greedy' woolgrowers are to blame for the collapse of the reserve price scheme and, therefore, are entirely responsible for the wool debt. According to this view, the key issue for wool policy is how to get woolgrowers to repay the debt incurred in amassing the wool stockpile and not the stockpile itself. First, the wool debt is an irretrievable cost and, secondly, we have a very big stockpile overhanging the market and affecting the market itself. I cannot see at this stage how imposing additional costs on woolgrowers for debt repayments could possibly be in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics data shows that woolgrowers stood to lose $33,700 a farm on average in 1992-93, bringing the average business operating losses to about $105,700. This is not new news. These figures have been around for a while now. It is little wonder that a lot of growers have been driven to suicide as a result of these financial pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear, though, to what extent woolgrowers should be held responsible for the debt. The industry incurred the debt during the operation of the reserve price scheme. But at all stages the industry body, the Australian Wool Corporation, was represented by Government Ministers, growers and processors of wool. So it was not entirely the woolgrowers who ran the whole situation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have to work out how to treat the policy errors of the Government. How much of that $2.6 billion worth of debt is due to Government policy errors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government has not taken any responsibility whatsoever for the mistakes it made. I know that we have had trotted out in this place and a lot of other places the damage done by Mr Kerin when he went overseas and gave ironclad guarantees. I know that Senator Sherry has heard about this ad nauseam, but that does not mean it is not correct. In fact, what has been said is correct. Some damage did occur. I have already spoken about the decisions that were taken by the government representatives on the board of the industry body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wool Marketing Act 1987 passed a large measure of the control over the setting of the minimum reserve price to the wool industry. It also enabled the Government to continue to use its powers to collect the wool tax and make the scheme compulsory. A decision to allow the MRP to be set so very high was made by the Government in May 1988 and it was implemented on 1 July 1988. I have raised this issue in the Senate ad nauseam, but it is still relevant. A decision was made in May to lift the reserve price from around 700c a kilo to 870c per kilo. By 1 July, the indicator, which was 1,300c per kilo when this decision was made, had dropped to 1,000c per kilo. There was only a 130c difference between the minimum reserve price and the price indicator and it was a disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government stood by for two years, from 1 July 1988 to 1 July 1990, without interfering at all&mdash;it had the power to interfere, as did the wool corporation&mdash;and the wool industry collapsed. The wool corporation was made up of non-woolgrowers, so we have to finally realise that the moral responsibility of all this debt does not lie entirely with the woolgrowers. It is a problem that has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first decision created a moral hazard for the industry, placing even careful wool industry leaders under enormous pressure to set the MRP higher. The Government had its advisers. It gave the wool corporation the power to set the minimum reserve price where it liked, and it was okayed by the Minister. It was when the general body of woolgrowers wanted the reserve price to be higher that we ran into trouble. As I said, it was obvious that, before the price of 870c per kilo was implemented on 1 July, we would be running into trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other precedents where the Government has made mistakes in administering policy, and has gone in and helped the industry out. The collapse of the State Bank of South Australia is a South Australian Government blunder, and the Federal Government has promised to pick up the cost of some of its mistakes. There is ample precedence for the Government could do something to help the wool industry. The woolgrowers certainly do not want a total handout for the $2.6 billion debt, but the Government made mistakes and it should accept certain responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the wool industry in Australia is probably in the worst situation ever. When I have complained about this during the past six months, I have been told, `You know what the problems are; what are your solutions?'. I, and others, have advocated certain solutions, but they have not been listened to or publicised very much because of the Federal and State elections. I read a very interesting article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. It is headed `Australia in bid to revive wool trade with Russia'. One of the solutions which I was advocating was that we have to create demand with non-traditional buyers. One non-traditional buyer that I have suggested is eastern Europe, where the President lead a delegation, of which I was part. Russia and the United States are also not buying enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> does give us a ray of hope. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>I admire the decision of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). I have been writing to him for six months; a lot of times I have not even got an answer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next step could be to draw Australian investment into the central European wool industry through the privatisation of the region's mills . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If we get in there with equity, we will make sure that our wool goes into that industry rather than some other country's wool, because many other countries do grow some very good wool. Dealing with Russia, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Russian textile industry is so short of funds that mills are unable to buy from local woolgrowers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, their own local woolgrowers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Russian industry analysts also estimate that between 30 and 50 per cent of the textile industry's capital equipment needs to be completely replaced.</PARA>
<PARA>This is where our chance lies. Australia could put equity into this third country which has high technology in a tripartite approach and set up a long-term demand for our wool. I will leave it at that. I welcome the decision by Mr Crean to visit these countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry), is at the table listening to the debate. The Government has to take responsibility for that section of the $2.6 billion debt where the former Minister made mistakes&mdash;we all make mistakes. The Government advisers in the corporation who made mistakes should also accept their share of the responsibility. I am sure that in seven years time the industry will have met its side of the bargain and repaid this debt and reduced the stockpile. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, with the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, we are having, for the third or fourth time, a debate on the wool industry. Much water has passed under the bridge, but what still remains is that the wool industry is in dire straits. Some areas are in even more difficulty because, compounded upon the low commodity prices, they also have drought, although we are not discussing that tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear some of the points that were made by those opposite. However, I would disagree with their suggestion that we abolish the retention of time limits on the legislation. That would send the wrong signals to everybody. It does not answer the question of how and from whom would the debt be recovered. We are extending the debt repayment by 12 months because the $118 million that is due for debt repayment in 1993-94 is already to hand. It means there is no need for the commission to go out and actually have to sell wool in this next financial year to face its debt repayments. If we removed the time limit from the legislative schedule it would remove the need for the commission to put wool on to the market, but we would be increasing the debt, because the debt has to be serviced. If we chose not to sell the wool, who would service that debt and how would it be serviced?  We have not heard about that tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the announcement was made about the time extension for the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, many people overlooked the point that Senator Panizza just briefly raised; that is, it is the intention of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) to travel around during the break before the Budget sittings to our wool buying countries. He will not only look at what those countries perceive to be the problems but also encourage them to get back into the marketplace and to buy the product. He will remind them of just how good our product and our industry is. No-one would quibble that wool is the best fibre product available in the marketplace because it is so versatile&mdash;it is warm, it is cool and it is everything one could want. However, we need to keep reminding people of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this debate is the review of the wool industry. Nobody seems to have looked very much at that. There have been calls here tonight to improve the marketing and promotion of wool, and to improve the standard of the clip and the way it is prepared.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the adequacy and efficiency of the social justice and structural adjustment measures as they apply to the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA>This review will address a number of the issues that the industry itself perceives and identifies as key issues that have to be addressed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill tonight is not just about the extension of time from seven years to eight years for the Wool Realisation Commission to wind up; it also involves the terms of reference for an inquiry into the industry. That inquiry will be one of the most significant things that has happened in this industry. It is a very important industry to this nation; if our woolgrowers are suffering in this crisis, and we produce the best wool available, I would not like to know what is happening to woolgrowers in other countries. However, at present, our main concern is with woolgrowers here in Australia. This very good package goes some way towards addressing those needs. We should also be aware that these moves have had a lot of support from many grower and farmer organisations in the country. I have much pleasure tonight in supporting this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Bill 1993, which we are speaking on tonight, is part of a package to try to solve the deep crisis that is afflicting the wool industry and, of course, through that, much of rural Australia. No doubt all of us are aware, through either personal experience or from watching television at night, of the crisis that is afflicting people in the drought stricken areas of Australia. I remind all honourable senators that, whether they grow sheep and produce wool in a drought affected area or in an area that is receiving good rainfall, the crisis in the wool industry affects people in the same way, because we have an enormous uncertainty about the price of wool in the future, an enormous debt overhanging the industry and, of course, the problem with the stockpile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak tonight not only to those honourable senators who are present in the chamber but also to Senator Austin Lewis who said last night, when we were looking at bringing on this debate, that he would listen to the quite lengthy list of speakers on this Bill tonight and would look forward to at least one of them coming up with a solution to the industry. I think he was being quite cynical, but I say to Senator Lewis that my solution to the crisis for wool may, indeed, be found through the review process that is going on into the marketing of wool and the future treatment of the stockpile. I certainly hope it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution will not be found by trying to redesign the bureaucracy that has built up around the wool industry, particularly through the Australian Wool Corporation and now the Wool Realisation Commission, but in destroying the bureaucracy around the wool industry and breaking down the industry into units that can be handled not only by growers but also by entrepreneurs who want to find new ways of processing wool, new woollen products and new ways of taking woollen products into new international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt that the bureaucracy that has surrounded the wool industry in Australia for so long now has ensured that the change that is required to move into a rapidly changing world, and to cope with rapidly changing tastes and rapidly changing economics, has simply not occurred. Most of us know from personal experience that the more distant bureaucracies and large corporations are from their members and constituents, the more inefficient those industries will be. This can relate to bureaucratic government departments or large bureaucratic private sector organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that until the Government in particular and the wool industry specifically come to grips with the problem of the size of the bureaucracy, the vested interests that are involved in controlling the stockpile, in marketing wool and in undertaking the research and development into wool, there will be no long-term solution. I said in my contribution to the debate on wool a couple of weeks ago that if the owners of a stockpile of a product, say, Ford motor cars, experience a massive decrease in the demand for motor cars and a massive increase in supply and have a few acres of parking space out in Geelong or somewhere filled with those products, the last thing they will do in trying to sell that stockpile is create a bureaucracy. They will not be looking to funding people who live and work in that bureaucracy with big salaries and telling them to spend X amounts on research and development and X amounts on marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What one would do if one were dinkum about getting rid of the stockpile, returning some certainty to the industry and returning it to equilibrium, would be to ensure that one had some highly motivated entrepreneurial individuals who were responsible for getting that product into the marketplace and getting a return for it as quickly as possible. One could not do better than getting a couple of thousand hungry used car salesmen out there selling the product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or real estate salesmen, or even hungry politicians. I say quite seriously that I am not advocating a way of breaking down the bureaucracy or breaking down the system that has been set up, but that we move from the present highly centralised, highly bureaucratic structure to a system where we can involve as many entrepreneurs and sales oriented people as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the world market and the industry itself&mdash;the growers and everyone else involved in the wool industry&mdash;can see a reduction in the stockpile and a significant reduction in the debt, then certainty will not return to the industry and people will not invest in it. Those involved in the industry will not increase investment in new equipment, new technologies, new products and new ways of marketing the product until this massive stockpile and associated debt are eradicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see a solution in extending the repayments schedule and extending the life of the stockpile for another year. Of course, it is an important palliative in the short term, but in the long term there needs to be a radical solution to the problem. I think that it will involve a destruction of the bureaucracy that is built around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are enormous vested interests built up in this industry and in the Australian Wool Corporation and it is associated bodies. What I am advocating today is that the solution to the problem is to destroy the bureaucracy, to walk over those vested interests and to ensure that the sale of wool and the stockpile in the interim is put in the hands of people who are about selling and getting a return as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that my experience in the last couple of months, in talking to woolgrowers and others who are now coming into the business of trying to find new markets, is quite pleasing. Some entrepreneurs I have met, such as those who are associated with the wool insulation business and who are trying to find alternative uses for wool, do not have a good relationship with the Australian Wool Corporation and its associated bodies. This reflects the bureaucratic inertia of such organisations in that those concerned cannot get answers or cooperation from the Wool Corporation because clearly some of the ideas that are being put forward by entrepreneurs are not in the mainstream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people are going behind the back of the realisation commission, behind the back of the Australian Wool Corporation, doing deals with growers, buying wool straight out of sheds and doing deals with overseas mills and, basically, ignoring the bureaucracy that is surrounding the wool industry. If that is what can happen in such a highly structured, centralised bureaucratic system that we have at the moment&mdash;if we can have these sorts of entrepreneurs working on the edges of the industry, trying to make a dollar out of solving the crisis&mdash;I wonder what could happen if we broke down the massive bureaucracy, got rid of the structure we have at the moment and opened the whole thing up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope my words have given Senator Austin Lewis a ray of hope. I suggest, particularly in light of the review that the Minister, Mr Crean, announced some weeks ago, that what the industry needs is not just a restructuring of the wool corporation and the setting up of new committees and new bureaucratic structures. Indeed, we should take the opportunity to say we have a real problem, to say that what has happened in the past 20 years has not worked for the industry. If we are going to solve the deep problems of the wool industry for all of rural Australia, we should take this opportunity to make some very radical change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate really holds no pleasure for me, like all those people involved in the rural area, former wool farmers, and people who have associations with the bush. These people are absolutely disgusted and dismayed at what is happening to the wool industry. I was very pleased to see that the Parliamentary Secretary to Mr Crean, Senator Sherry, my colleague from Tasmania, was here earlier; I presume he is coming back. I hope he is here to hear what I say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about tonight has been well laid out by previous speakers. We are trying to extend the period for the debt repayment on our stockpile from seven to eight years and make available $50 million for interest rate subsidies. At a time when we need leadership, direction and a united approach to try to put the wool industry back on track, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill can be classed only as a very small contribution to what is a huge problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a large number of speakers on this Bill. The time we have is limited, but I am pleased to see there are so many speakers&mdash;and so there should be. The whole matter of the wool stockpile, the debt, the drought and everything else associated with the wool industry at the moment can rightly be called a natural disaster of unprecedented length. Here we are in 1993 with the lowest wool prices in 50 years, coupled with Australia's farm debt, now a staggering $15.6 billion, with an annual interest bill in the order of $12 billion. It is almost getting to the stage of what is happening with our Government and its debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only suggestion and action from the Government is to provide an interest subsidy of $50 million and to defer the debt repayment for one year. On top of that, the Government has set up the 30th review we have had into the wool industry, chaired by Mr Garnaut. Let us hope that this 30th review will come up with something which may be of some help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that the major problem facing the wool industry at the moment is the stockpile&mdash;some 3.9 million bales. Just to give some idea of the magnitude of that, the other day I read that it equates to 11.7 million filing cabinets. Stacked one on top of the other, it would measure 5.9 million metres high, compared with Mount Everest which is a mere 8,848 metres high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was having a game of tennis today I worked out that the two tennis courts we were on would probably hold, with a bit of luck, 1,000 thousand bales of wool. If we multiply that by 4,000 we get some idea of the quantity of wool that is waiting to be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who do we blame for all of this? It is very easy to blame the Government and the wool corporation. I suppose that, for starters, they are the ones we should look at. Over the years we have seen the wool corporation and the International Wool Secretariat waste millions of dollars on extravagant and useless wool promotions. I suppose that was fair enough when wool was selling at 1,000c a kilogram. Who amongst the woolgrowers, including myself, was ever going to question the wool corporation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in 1990 I did&mdash;at an Agricultural Outlook Conference here in Canberra. I had not been in this place very long. At a private briefing given to us by the chairman of the wool corporation, Hugh Beggs, he said that the wool stockpile then stood at 2.5 million bales. I said, `Are you sure that it is not 3.5 million bales?'. He said, `No, of course it's not'. A week later we found out that it was 3.5 million bales. He not only misled me but he also misled Australia by making that sort of statement. Obviously he was misled, too, because he was reported as saying&mdash;a very remarkable quote, which he will probably never put in a frame over the top of his bed&mdash;`We are lucky, those of us in the wool industry, in having a product which is almost infinitely marketable'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that same day I also asked whether the wool corporation had a fall-back position if anything went wrong with the reserve price scheme, which was experiencing a bit of drama. At that time the reserve price was about 860c. It had just fallen back to 700c when Mr Kerin said that it was immutable and was never going to be moved. It was amazing to me that a multi-million dollar corporation that had been running the wool industry for so long did not have a fall-back position or an emergency plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, when we blame the wool corporation, we have to say that the Federal government of the time must take its share of the blame. We all remember&mdash;it has been spoken about here tonight&mdash;that the fiddling of the reserve price scheme did nothing but create uncertainty in the world wool markets. We all remember the approval of the 870c a kilogram floor price. The money&mdash;I hope I declared the fact that I am a woolgrower&mdash;that I was paying out of my wool account, which was not all that big, was going into an account to buy back the wool I was selling. When it was reduced to 700c a kilogram, with about three million bales in stock, the situation was quite ridiculous. The iron-clad guarantee that Mr Kerin gave did not last very long; in fact, it eroded very quickly. I have heard of some buyers losing heaps of money. One buyer lost $50 million. It is no wonder that those people buying our wool lost faith in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another casualty of the wool crisis has been the CSIRO's Wool Research and Development Corporation. Because of the drop in the price of wool, the amount of money that went into that organisation has dropped from $52 million in 1990 to $29 million this financial year. That has not only put at risk 150 jobs; it also going to put at risk the critical research carried out by that corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney would remember how, during our time on the animal welfare committee, we had an insight into the wonderful work the corporation is doing. Things such as the flystrike program, the worm-free sheep program, scouring technology, permacrease and Siromark which it has been involved with over the years will be seriously affected by the downturn in the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, as a member of the rural and regional affairs committee, you would know that we have been in the ideal situation over the last year or so, during the drought inquiry that we conducted and now the present shearing industry inquiry, to observe just what is happening out in the bush and the effect it is having on not just the farmers or the woolgrowers but everybody who is concerned with this industry. I do not think anybody comprehends the effect that this whole matter is having on rural and regional Australia. Everybody is affected and everybody should be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I want to talk about solutions. Some of the proposed solutions have been mixed and varied. Premier Goss in Queensland said we should burn the wool stockpile. Another suggested solution, from the CWA, was that we should knit it away. Another suggestion, from a well-known economist from the economics department of La Trobe University, Mr Peter Bardsley, was that we should double the wool tax&mdash;and that was to raise the incomes of the wool producers of this country. I do not know which of those would solve the problem. I do not think any of them would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wool Council of Australia is now calling for the amalgamation of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Australian Wool Research and Development Corporation. Only a couple of years ago the Wool Council was calling for them to be split up because it believed they could do a better job separately. Now it is talking about getting them back together. So we are all over the place at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted in a press article the other day that the Chairman of the Australian Wool Corporation, Mac Drysdale, has warned that unless the Russian economic situation improves we will never win back our third largest market. That leads me, in the last minute or so of the time available to me, to say that I appreciate the efforts Senator Sherry made on my behalf to allow me to see the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean)&mdash;I think it was around 1 o'clock last Friday morning. I believe that is where the answer is. We have to get out there and sell this wool, and promote it, even if we have to take a few risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the Wool Realisation Commission has one hand tied behind its back. It does not have the flexibility it needs. We have proposals coming forward all the time. Some of them are quite weird and some of them need investigation. One of the proposals that Senator Sherry and I know about is an offer by the Latvian Government, through Vis Feldmanis&mdash;a Tasmanian whom Senator Sherry would know, who is acting on behalf of the National Bank of Latvia&mdash;to sell half of its leading mills to Australian interests at bargain basement prices in exchange for wool and cash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the sorts of deals we should be looking at, and there are quite a few of them out there. Unfortunately, the Wool Realisation Commission does not have the flexibility to deal with those types of offers. If the wool corporation was a commercial operation rather than a semi-government operation, I believe it would have that flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have to use more aggressive marketing and more imagination to try to reverse the trend whereby we have lost market share to cotton and synthetics. In 1950-51, for instance, when dags were bringing a pound a pound, we had 10 per cent of the market. Last financial year, 1991-92, we had 4.4 per cent of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note today from our local paper in Hobart that a team of woolgrowers went to America and talked to the people over there about wool. They found that people in America, the consumers of our wool, are worried about the prickly effect of it. They are worried about this and that. Think of the millions of dollars that have been spent through the wool corporation trying to promote our wool over the years. It is millions of dollars down the drain if the man in the street in Los Angeles believes that wool is not the right fibre. If that is the case, all I can say is that all the money that the woolgrowers and the Government have put into wool promotion for so long has been for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry has the job in front of him to convince his Minister that some changes have to be made. I hope that, as a result of this debate tonight, the suggestions that he has already and those that he will hear around Australia from more learned people than myself will go a long way towards turning around what has been, and is, one of the great industries in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill is one part of a four-part approach the Government is taking to the wool crisis. The measures include interest rate subsidies, maintenance of the wool tax, restructuring of the debt and an inquiry. Much of what has been said here tonight has canvassed the broad issues. A good deal of what has been said has a strong element of truth to it in terms of the way the Australian Wool Realisation Commission has operated and the complete failure of the old scheme of reserve price mechanisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit unfortunate that some people still seem to hark back to those days. In my own State as late as 5 May the agriculture Minister was still suggesting that the reason for the crisis in the wool industry was the changing of that scheme. He made that point to the Victorian Parliament and effectively blamed John Kerin for the crisis in the wool industry. An interesting observation that people make about the crisis in the industry is that people have learnt so little about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that some people in Victoria, such as  the Premier, have maintained a similar very negative attitude towards the proposals that have been advanced by this Government to address what is obviously a very serious problem. The Premier indicated that he thought the proposals that the Federal Government was bringing forward were no more than a bandaid package. It is little wonder that in Victoria, with the foot-in-mouth approaches that the Premier has taken, the transport Minister is currently organising a challenge against the Premier and is openly canvassing votes within the party room. It is common knowledge that the Premier himself is backgrounding journalists in an attempt to undermine and discredit his own transport Minister. It is those sorts of attitudes, that are reflected in Victoria, that I find quite disappointing. They indicate the depth of ignorance that still exists within certain parties in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the approximately 8,000 woolgrowers in Victoria, about 2,000 will be seeking financial assistance this financial year. The crisis is quite pronounced. However, it is not just the woolgrowers who are affected by this crisis. This point has been made by other speakers, but I think it needs to be emphasised, because it is not often addressed in public debate. Australian shearers, for instance, have played a vital role in the development of the wool industry and have a proud record of advancing working conditions for all Australians. Their incomes have also been slashed. Many growers are using the present crisis within the industry to undermine and attack workers' wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the recent debate which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has raised about New Zealand shearers coming to this country will be raised again in New Zealand. It has been estimated that up to half of our qualified shearers are currently unemployed as a result of the influx of large numbers of people from New Zealand who are accepting conditions of work in breach of awards. We have also recently seen award decisions of the commission being challenged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is plenty of justification for saying that. There is a real problem in this country which simply cannot be addressed by looking at the wool industry merely in terms of what happens up to the farm gate. The proposed inquiry will offer some real alternatives; it will examine other means of securing additional markets. It is one to thing to talk about the situation in eastern Europe&mdash;and I think that has to be done, in terms of the Minister seeking additional markets internationally&mdash;but we also need to examine the other people who are directly affected by the crisis in the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the shearers. Perhaps the textile workers in this country also have a real interest in what happens to this industry. As has been stated here tonight, there have bee some problems with people developing alternative markets for our woolclip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Barney Cooney and I have had brought to our attention the fact that the textile industry in Victoria is suffering very badly. But there are other ways&mdash;for example, value adding&mdash;of attracting markets and developing industries. So the wool stockpile could be used for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen proposals such as using wool for insulation. In my previous employment at the Ministry of Planning and Housing in Victoria, I had some involvement in the trialling of wool bats. The BWIU, in conjunction with entrepreneurs, was seeking to find alternatives to synthetic fibres. Although that has fallen a bit by the wayside, it is another area which I trust the Minister will be able to pursue after the inquiry reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the whole notion that we have to provide assistance to the wool industry is essentially correct. However, it is important that the States also play a role in that process. I note that measures have been taken in Western Australia and Victoria. However, I am concerned about recent steps in Victoria to make sure that the money is actually available. There have been suggestions that the source of that money has been identified and its availability has to be guaranteed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, may I commence by saying how pleasing it is to have you in the chair this evening and to enjoy your stewardship over these proceedings. I am concerned, however, that the woolgrowers of Australia, and the people who are dependent on them for their living, are being sold short by a government whose penny-pinching attitude will exacerbate the situation in which many of our woolgrowers find themselves at this point in time. Why? Because the Government has taken an attitude that says, `Instead of giving flexibility to the realisation of the stockpile, we are merely going to postpone the crisis for another 12 months by extending the debt repayment schedule for another 12 months'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is desperately needed at this point is quite simply an abandonment of the debt repayment schedule. We need to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we do not flood the market with the wool that is currently in the stockpile; to ensure that we do not depress the prices that farmers are getting for what they produce so that the farmers who are still left in the industry&mdash;heaven knows we have lost enough to date&mdash;will have a chance to get a decent rate of return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would also allow us to achieve one other thing: at only a very small rate of realisation it is possible for us to set a zero tax for woolgrowers in so far as the Wool Realisation Commission is concerned. That 4 1/2 per cent of tax is worth something like $27 a bale. It is very important that we do everything in our power to maximise the cash flow of our woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just a couple of moments ago we heard Senator Carr make a plea on behalf of shearers. I am not going to get into the rights and wrongs of the shearing industry, nor am I going to go into detail about the rates that shearers get, but it is interesting to note, as Senator Panizza interjected, that the rates for shearers have gone up. There are many in this country who would argue that if the rates for shearers had stayed the same, the shearers would actually be making more money than they are now. But the point is this: unless we can maximise the cash flow of the woolgrowers, there will be fewer and fewer shearers working because there will be less opportunity for woolgrowers to pay those shearers to shear the sheep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people in Queensland, in the areas around the Warrego, who are shearing their entire flock themselves. Senator Boswell brought to the attention of the media a story of one young man who was spending months and months single-handedly shearing his flock because he could not afford the cost of having them shorn. Every single dollar of tax that the Government puts on woolgrowers is a further impediment to the prosperity of the industry. That is why those of us on this side support the amendment that has been moved, which points out that the inflexibility of the Government's approach to this problem, the retention of a time limit, sends all the wrong signals to the wool market. It sends to it a signal that this Government is not willing to back the wool industry. It sends to it a signal that the Government is unwilling to take the steps necessary to return prosperity to woolgrowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the market wants from us is simply confidence. The market wants to believe that we believe in the wool industry at a time when we can finance our stockpile at interest rates that are very low compared with what we have been paying in the past. Now more than ever is the time for us to be saying, `Yes, we are willing to carry the financing cost of the stockpile because we know that at the end of the day we will recoup it and more'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can finance this stockpile at 7 1/2 per cent. We could hold the stockpile for 14 years, pay the interest, sell the wool at the end and still come out on top. But instead, the Government has given the industry just one year of grace in the extension of the debt repayment schedule for the Wool Realisation Commission. The wool industry deserves better from its government than the treatment it has received, which is merely an extension of one year in the debt repayment schedule.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Do not forget that this industry financed the development of inland Australia and was a principal export earner for this nation for most of its history. Its members now come before this Parliament saying, `We desperately need assistance'&mdash;and these are proud people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Deputy President, you would understand how I felt last night when I received a call from a young man from Surat who phoned to say that he had been unable to continue working on the family farm. The farm had not had any rain for 12 months and he had to go off and earn money as a pilot in the Northern Territory to try to get some cash flow to help keep the farm going. His story is the story of thousands and thousands of wool-growing families. These are people for whom the rural adjustment scheme is not a hope of salvation but an absurdity. Under the criteria they cannot qualify for RAS because the Government assesses them as not being viable enough. These are people for whom the promise of assistance is held further than arm's reach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does the wool industry a grave wrong in not extending the debt repayment schedule further or abandoning it so that the wool industry knows that we will not flood the market with more wool in 12 months time, so that the wool industry knows that we are willing to hold on to the stockpile until the price comes up. If we release wool into the market in large quantities, or give the industry reason to believe that we will do so, the only consequence will be a reduction in the price. That does not just mean a reduction in the earnings of woolgrowers, but a reduction in the earnings of shearers, truckies and everybody else in this country. Hundreds of thousands of people in this country are dependent on the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural industries in this country are at a point of crisis where they deserve consideration from a government with a big picture vision. Whilst interest rates are relatively low, the Government ought to put together a scheme of debt refinancing for agricultural industries. It would be easy to do and would have manifest benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment we have a situation where the banks which are carrying the rural debt have been forced to make massive provisions against the possibility that the people who owe the money to the banks, the farmers in particular, will not be able to repay. I do not know what the level of provisioning is by banks against debts in the rural industry. It is probably about 30c in the dollar. But if the Government was willing to borrow the money at low interest rates to refinance those farmers and, therefore, buy the debts off the banks, an immediate tax benefit would come to the Government, because the banks that had already made provisions at, say, 70c in the dollar would all of a sudden be realising their loans at something like 90c to 100c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss that the banks had previously incurred would be brought on to the balance sheet as a capital gain&mdash;as a profit. Therefore, a portion of that money&mdash;something like half of the difference&mdash;would be recouped in increased taxes next year. There would be an immediate increase in government revenue. More importantly, not only would it give us the opportunity to finance the rural industries of this country at low interest rates over a long period of time, it would also guard against the possibility of the banks making further provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around Charleville and the red soil country people are selling their farms for $2 an acre. One can pick up a 60,000 acre farm for $120,000 with the house thrown in. What level of losses will the banks suffer if that is the sort of return they get on their loans? One must remember that these loans were made at a time when property sold for a much higher price and the level of indebtedness now surely well exceeds the level of money being realised when those farms go on the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must be willing to put a long-term financing package together for the wool industry and other agricultural industries which desperately need this assistance. The question is, do we want to have farmers? Do we want people producing agricultural exports? Do we want people providing the incentive for small towns and regional centres to continue to exist, or will we throw them to the wolves because it does not suit the Government? At a time when money is to be found in plenty for those in the trade union movement, and at a time when the Government seems to find extra money to send travelling players and minstrels around the country to entertain the masses, one wonders why it is that the backbone of this nation's economy has been left so desperately undefended by our Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I can only say that this country and every single Australian has enjoyed the prosperity which has come from the hard work and labour of our farmers for decades and decades. How can we call ourselves Australians if, at this hour of crisis, we now turn our backs on the people who have done so much for our country? I think of my friends in Queensland who have not had rain for three years but who are soldiering on and on. I believe we owe it to them and to all the woolgrowers and primary producers in this country. We owe it to the young fellow who phoned me last night and said he had to get a job as a pilot in the Northern Territory. We owe it to the bloke who sheared his entire flock on his own because he could not afford to get shearers. We owe it to that industry to put something back and say `Thank you' for what it has done for us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993, which we support because it extends to the wool industry the period of the Government guarantee from seven to eight years to cover the additional year of debt. The wool industry would be in a much better position to trade its way out of its entrenched troubles if there were fewer bodies administering and handling its various activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this Bill is all about the activities surrounding those people whom I might call the liquidators&mdash;the people who have the responsibility of getting rid of the wool. What people have not realised is that there is a vast difference between a marketer and a liquidator. Their approaches to selling and distribution are entirely different. So we have a fundamental problem with the attitudes and philosophies of a group of people who have the job of liquidating wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest mistakes the liquidators made was having a schedule of their realisation over time. If you have to sell a commodity over a definite period, you never send out a signal to your customers as to the quantity and value of the commodity that you are going to dispose of over the various time schedules. The sooner we get back to a system of trying to market our wool internationally in a proper way, the sooner we will be able to trade our way out of difficulty. That means some restructuring, such as getting rid of a number of the bodies that have a finger in the wool handling pie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some hope on the horizon; in recent weeks there has been some increase in price. I remind the Senate of a matter that I have raised in my own State. We must recognise that nowadays, in effect, we have two stockpiles. There is the official stockpile, which is causing so much heartburn, and there is another one which is equally as important and which requires consideration. That is wool which is stockpiled not only in farmers' sheds, brokers' houses, warehouses and other places, but around the world in noil form, semi-processed stock and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be careful when we start talking about burning wool, giving wool away and so on. A solution requires the pooling of the various managerial ideas that have been around, including one from the Country Women's Association about encouraging people to knit more. Obviously with the price down, more people will feel encouraged to knit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems in marketing wool is that industry leaders and Ministers have not visualised the sort of industry they want in the long term. In the past the industry has been based on a high price for that section of the clip known as the fine micron end, from 19 microns down. But if we are going to return to buoyant earnings across the spectrum, we have to refocus on wool as a broad use, multi-use fibre and not just as an exclusive fibre commanding very high prices. We have to look at more average prices, and focus on an increased demand for the product as a whole rather than on wool as a specialty fibre. If we concentrate in the next few years on wool as a specialty fibre there will be no future for this great industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add a word of warning as one who spent a number of years in the wool industry. A lot of people do not realise  that by withholding supply we are wrecking the long-term interests of the industry, because wool must flow through the system. Once the processors stop using wool and move to synthetics, it is very hard to get back. Because of the low prices in eastern Europe and elsewhere, we have a great opportunity to get people back into producing woollen products. For this purpose, we must restructure. We must have a sense of direction regarding where the future of this once great industry should lie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respect the advice given by Senator Watson. I know of his experience in the industry, and I think it is important that we be generous enough to recognise the merit in what he says. What is unfortunate about this debate is that too much of the material that has been printed so far in our newspapers and too much of the wordage that has been delivered in places such as this have suffered from the same inadequacy. It has been theory delivered in isolation&mdash;not just isolation from the real world, but isolation from other theories and other ideas. It is the lack of respect that we have given to other ideas that has made it so much more difficult to make progress with this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that we all suffer from the delusion that our theories will actually have an impact on the problem, but our individual theories will not. Even what I have just said is wrong. There is not one problem; there is not one single fix for the wool industry. The industry suffers from manifold problems. It has demands which can be met only by a cooperative strategy&mdash;a strategy which addresses a variety of ways to achieve profitability for our wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time after time in this place we spout platitudes. Tonight we have seen honourable senators trying to curry favour with a few people here and a few people there. Time and time again, written speeches describing the situation are read out with great passion; facts are read out about the status of the industry by speaker after speaker. Each speaker is attempting to demonstrate his or her intimate knowledge of the problem, as if to say: `I share your problems. I told the Parliament all about it. I am the one who represented you in that place'. There is a lot of gnashing of teeth and much wailing, much flailing of arms goes on, but there is little tangible action. And it is tangible action that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not see gnashing of teeth, we see the frantic scribbling of pens in the creation of an endless stream of press releases. Honourable senators know the sort to which I am referring: the one-page press releases with the quick headline grabbing cop-out, such as burn the stockpile; freeze it; trigger it; knit it; give it away; weave it into blankets for aid. Mr Tuckey, who is a member in the other place, calls these snake oil remedies, and I agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of these solutions is impractical and impossible to deliver on its own. During the last debate that we had on this subject a few days ago, I said&mdash;and I know that the entire chamber agrees with me&mdash;that burning would be an incredible logistical exercise. It would require huge amounts of energy. The transport that would be required even to burn the stockpile would be costly. One cannot just light a match and throw it into a warehouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard criticism of the other snake oil remedies, such as how many jumpers would need to be knitted. If we gave it away, we would still owe billions of dollars to the people we borrowed money from to buy the stockpile. The transport costs could well add on a few million dollars to that process. The funny thing is&mdash;and if this problem were not so serious it would be funny&mdash;that this has been recognised. In an article by Mark Irving in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 1 May, Barry Jackson from the Australian Wool Corporation said of the stockpile:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And if we gave it away to knitters, we'd need to spend $12 a kilo to convert it into yarn. That would cost $8.4 billion. . . </PARA>
<PARA>We should not take such suggestions at face value, but with a little enlightenment aimed at considering them carefully. I am not dismissive of them, and I will address that in a few moments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make sure that we critically evaluate the concept that there is a quick fix. More complicated fixes have been mentioned by other people. These people are the ones who deliver the comprehensive plans, who want to change the parameters entirely and want to establish new triggers, new rules, new floor prices, new thresholds and so on. These particular solutions are characterised by a lot of noise and a lot of fanfare. But in fact there is very little likelihood of our seeing the revolution that would be necessary for the implementation of those particular plans. I say that because these well-intentioned plans do not recognise the politics of the present situation. The politics is that almost all of the comprehensive plans would require a revolution to implement&mdash;and it should not be about revolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee was asking for a reshaping of finance. I agree with a lot of what Senator O'Chee said in that regard, but we must be careful&mdash;and we heard this expression a lot during the debate about the level of the wool tax some years ago&mdash;not to throw the baby out with the bath water. The comprehensive plans would require a revolution to implement. The thing that best describes these plans is that they are cheap shots, fired in the knowledge that the person making the comprehensive plan is seldom required to explain or take responsibility for its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am trying to get across to the Senate is not a belittlement of such plans because sometimes many of them sell well as books. I think the plans are well-intentioned but politically unwise because there is too much point scoring, too much politicking and too much self-aggrandisement about this whole question. We do this and then wonder why the electorate is so cynical, why there is no national swell of enthusiasm about any particular plan and why people are not actually leaping to follow a particular path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are really just filling the air with words. I think it is about time we actually stopped and started to listen to each other. We should begin by recognising the merits of each other's arguments and building on those things that can he done. I will start the ball rolling tonight. I will recognise that Senator Panizza and Senator Crane were perfectly accurate in an earlier debate on this topic when they introduced a number of the features into the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Tuckey, in the other place, suggested that there should really be a government sponsored attempt made to establish a retail outlet in Japan, for example, as a show case for what could be done. What he was proposing was not another one of those trial plots or combined retail ventures in private industry, but he was talking about government intervention to establish such a proposal. I think that is great. Government intervention and support is what is needed and such a suggestion would certainly receive the whole-hearted support of the Australian Democrats. I think we ought to look beyond party politics and recognise the merit of some of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McLachlan in the other place suggested selling a specific amount of the stockpile at an early discount. He suggested that the rest of the stockpile would be less of a problem if, for example, a significant portion of the stockpile&mdash;whether that be a quarter, a third or a half&mdash;be sold at an early discount. I suggest there is some merit in that proposal as well and I would like to build on it a bit. I suggest&mdash;and Senator Panizza was saying something similar to this a few days ago&mdash;that the wool that we sell in the first instance should not be sold to our traditional wool markets and not sold for the traditional uses to which wool has been put, but rather for uses which are novel and which do not compete with our traditional wool markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sounds just a bit easy to say, but I will continue that theme and fill it out because examples of it have been given. Part of what Senator Panizza was saying some days ago was that such uses need aggressive marketing. Senator Crane added some of the novel uses which need to be expanded upon. Those who are interested in the wool industry already know that a huge potential exists for the replacement of imported wool used in the manufacture of carpet in Australia. I do not know what the exact percentage is at the moment but, not long ago, 85 per cent of the wool used in Australia to manufacture carpet was imported. We imported it from New Zealand, Pakistan, Uruguay, Argentina&mdash;from a number of places which honourable senators would be surprised to know we traded with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, would be aware that situated in the city in which he lives is one of Australia's fine carpet wool manufacturing companies. At that establishment in Devonport, the factory is willing to&mdash;and does&mdash;buy all carpet wool which is produced in Tasmania, yet it still imports a huge amount from overseas. At first glance, it might be thought that the superfine merino or the wool we produce for other uses may not be suitable for carpet, but that is not the case at all. The best, strongest wool for carpet is in the order of 32 microns, but it is possible to use wool of 28 microns or even finer in the manufacture of carpets, provided one can buy it cheaply enough. And this is where I suggest the circle can be completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day Senator Panizza described a considerable portion of the stockpile as being bellies, skirtings, crutchings and whatever else. I told Senator Panizza of an entrepreneur who has managed to sell such wool to India for use in carpet, regardless of its micron. The fact was that it was cheap wool. This is where the discounted wool from the stockpile could be used. I suggest that such wool should be made available to Australia's carpet industry at the discount about which I have just been speaking. One source of a subsidy to pay for that discount is the $250 million which is necessary to meet storage and interest payments. That is a cost at the moment, but if the quantity of wool were removed it would no longer be a cost. That gives a hint of the source of the subsidy which could be used to attract the discount to provide that wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other things which are imported could be replaced with low cost, low quality wool. Again, those who are interested and informed in the wool industry recognise the fact that synthetic woolpacks can be replaced with woollen woolpacks, and have been, successfully. When I suggest there ought to be action rather than words, a very good example of government action would be to facilitate the development of the industry&mdash;which already exists, which needs expanding&mdash;by expanding the provision of woollen woolpacks to replace the synthetic ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As those in the wool industry know, synthetic woolpacks seemed attractive at first. When I was first involved in the wool industry we used hessian woolpacks, even before core sampling. At the time we took a few pounds of wool out of the top of the hessian pack, used that for display and repacked and restitched later. I did not like synthetic packs when they were introduced because they were awkward to handle, slippery and burned the inside of one's forearms when trying to move the things around. I think it would be great if we were able to replace those packs. I know what they are called in the industry, but I will not use that term here; it was not a favourable term that was used to describe the new breed of synthetic woolpacks. It would be a great day to return to a natural fibre, nothing which could be better than wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bounty for the production of such items is the sort of government action, initiative and intervention which would provoke a greater use of such material. I think the same government action is consistent with the support for what I previously described as snake oil remedies. They are only snake oil remedies when the proponent writes a letter to the editor and says, `I reckon we ought to knit the stockpile', or whatever. They become useful if the Government has the capacity to recognise their usefulness and to take action which would facilitate that use. The CWA has taken action; it is instructing children, particularly Victorian school children, in the fine art of knitting. In this Senate I remember challenging other senators to knit a square for National Wool Day last year. My square may not have been all that impressive but at least I completed it. I am disappointed that so few senators took up the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting for one moment that the Government fund every idea that flashes through the mind of every writer of a letter to the editor. I am suggesting that the Government demonstrate active consideration of a variety of actions, initiate an aggressive, broad-fronted attack on the matter and recognise the merit of the sorts of suggestions being made about alternative marketing strategies by the coalition. I am happy to admit that flashier thinkers than I have come up with alternative strategies which have merit. That is the step which is necessary to take in this place. Instead of politicking, it should recognise the merit of each other's arguments. I am happy to admit that some of the alternative marketing strategies suggested by the coalition have merit. I would like to see the Government recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation demonstrates that the Government recognises its responsibility to do something about the industry but it does not demonstrate the fact that it is doing everything possible. While what we hear from the coalition demonstrates concern, it does not demonstrate that that responsibility is being shared. There are many other areas of government where the coalition positively wallows in the Government's misfortune. We see it every day; whether it is the statistics or the indicators about unemployment, the balance of trade or inflation, a sort of glee comes across the coalition when a set of bad figures come across. </PARA>

It is like the Government taking credit for the relief of the drought some years ago. But it cannot be blamed for everything and, in the same vein, the rest of us cannot avoid responsibility. I believe we have the responsibility to be constructive, to recognise suggestions which have merit and to support those measures which can assist the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Amendment Bill 1993 is to extend the repayment of accumulated debt of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission from seven to eight years. While not opposing this Bill, because the rescheduling gives the woolgrowers an extra year to repay the wool debt, I believe it is important to join with my colleagues in pointing out to the Government the problems it has created and which it is currently perpetuating in the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years there has been a dramatic downturn in prices, a rapid and large accumulation of stocks and the abandonment of the reserve price scheme. This combination has placed the wool industry under a number of short to medium-term pressures. The most important of these is the cost of servicing debt incurred via the stockpile; the challenge of managing and disposing of the stockpile; the economic and social impact of a substantial decline in woolgrowers' incomes; and the need to adjust productive capacity. Add to this the disaster of one of this century's worst droughts and it should be obvious that the people of rural Australia certainly need assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is not obvious that the Government will take more effective action than the measures that we have in this Bill before us today. The very serious plight of the Australian wool industry and those players in it, including many people who are not woolgrowers, needs to be urgently addressed. The crisis extends well beyond woolgrowers and their families. The crisis involves everyone in rural communities whether they be directly employed as woolgrowers or whether they make up part of the community that services the wool growing industry. In fact, entire rural communities face nothing short of economic and social devastation if the current disastrous prices prevail in the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business losses for the average woolgrower over the last three years totalled $100,000 and similar losses are expected this year. The current stockpile of 3.9 million bales has barely shifted in the last nine months and it is an ominous shadow over the future of the entire industry. The forecast total production figure for greasy wool this year is 851 million kilograms. Next year this is anticipated to come down to 805 million; however, some estimates put it as low as 700 million kilograms. This provides further scope for wool to be sold from the stockpile without necessarily depressing the effect on sales through the auction system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We plainly believe that the Government could have done more for the wool industry in this hour of critical need. For example, the Government has failed to address the call from the Wool Council of Australia for a 12-month waiving of the 4.5 per cent debt repayment component of the wool tax. This single measure would have helped all woolgrowers. The Government could also have taken the opportunity with this Bill to slacken the strings which control the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. It could have given the AWRC increased flexibility to go out and market wool from the stockpile rather than wait for buyers to come to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could have removed from public scrutiny the operations of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission so that buyers would not know how much wool the commission was selling or at what price it was selling it and, therefore, what other buyers were doing. The Government could have allowed the commission to establish more markets, develop innovative trade deals and new uses for wool, but it has not gone down that path. Above all, the Government had the opportunity to send a clear signal to the market that there would be absolutely no chance of a fire sale of the wool stockpile. The Government has failed to do any of these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this Bill the Government has chosen to extend the repayment deadline by one year. This is a welcome move, but it really only puts the problem off for another year. In fact, it gives woolgrowers unfounded confidence only for them to find that the problem is still there when the repayment schedule advances 12 months further down the track. The coalition and the woolgrowers themselves do not deny the need to repay the debt. Growers have a vested interest in the rapid repayment of the debt, otherwise they will be burdened with the cost of servicing it and paying for the stockpiling of wool. These are additional costs that this wool industry could well do without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also conveniently ignores the fact that it removed drought from the natural disaster relief arrangements and so it is partly responsible for the crisis in many areas of the country, including many woolgrowing areas, now affected by drought. There seems to be a broad acceptance that drought is a recurring theme in this country. It is something that rural Australians have to be prepared to confront and to plan for when they can. However, given the economic climate in which farmers have been operating for the last few years, this task has been made exceptionally difficult. It is worth observing in any case that the severity of the current drought puts it into a category which no rural producer could possibly hope to plan for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, it is important to note that Australia's rural sector is one of the most productive in the world and that our productivity improvements in recent years have shown the rest of the Australian community what productivity improvement is really all about. It has a record of which it can be extremely proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this Government continues to fail to introduce the policies that are necessary to help this very worthwhile industry. This Bill is not a significant step forward in solving the wool crisis. There are many measures which the Government could have introduced along with this Bill, but it has failed to act. I cannot oppose the Bill because it does give small relief, but I implore the Government to act more effectively to help this industry by implementing some of the measures that the coalition has outlined today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tagged my name onto the end of the speakers list because there are a few specific observations that I would like to make about the wool package. The wool industry, probably Australia's greatest rural industry, is in desperate trouble. All honourable senators recognise that. People are coming up with so many different plans, and we have heard many of them tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has brought forward two packages: the Federal Government wool package, which is before us at the moment, worth $44.6 million, and the drought package, worth $6 million. In round terms, the two packages assist the wool industry by around $50 million. As well as this, $160 million has been provided under RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool industry now has assistance of around $200 million in interest subsidies and farm exits. This is a lot of money&mdash;no-one would argue that it is not. But I point out to people, particularly Government supporters, who would say this is a lot of money that in 1983 the Fraser-Anthony Government devoted the equivalent of about $700 million to saving the rural industries. We can debate that backwards and forwards, but this Government is the government at the moment and obviously its preferred options are not with the farmers. It has its own interests and people whom it wants to look after; unfortunately, the farmers do not fall into that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are about 60,000 woolgrowers who produce wool in some quantity. To the best of my knowledge, 18,000 to 19,000 dedicated woolgrowers produce about 48 per cent of the total wool output. The average farm loss for a wool producer is around $40,000, and 91 per cent of those 18,000 to 19,000 people are in that category and are losing money. About only nine per cent of woolgrowers are actually running at a profit. I would like to know how they are doing so; it is beyond me how anyone could make a profit out of wool with the way prices are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every kilo of wool sold at auction costs growers $2 to produce. The average debt in Queensland is around $250,000 per farm. We are told that growers are at risk if their equity is under 70 per cent. In Queensland, equity is around 58 per cent, and I imagine it would be the same in western New South Wales. Very many properties and farmers are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both packages contained in this Bill introduced today assist farmers. The wool package assists 5,700 farmers and the drought package assists another 820 farmers. So roughly 6,500 farmers out of 18,000 are receiving some sort of RAS assistance. I rose to speak tonight to bring this point to the attention of the Senate: what is happening to the other 12,000 farmers who are not receiving RAS? Some of them have off-farm investments and are not eligible for RAS, but there are a great many more who are not receiving any assistance at all. There are 4,500 farmers or their wives who are on Job Search allowance and there are 200-odd on farm household support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Crean went out to the west of Queensland and told the farmers that there was assistance for them. Mrs Greer, the lady from Thargomindah or somewhere out west of Queensland, was very grateful to see Mr Crean. Mr Crean made various statements in the media that there would be assistance for these particular hard-pressed growers affected by not only drought but also the low wool price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the only assistance available to those types of people, people that are at the desperation stage with no income because of drought and low commodity prices, is that of farm household support. When people do accept that, they are taking the first step towards exiting their property. Farm household support, which is the equivalent of Job Search allowance or unemployment benefit, is a loan. It is a loan for a period of nine months, and if the grower goes over that period, he has to pay back that loan and exit the property. That is why only 200 people so far have availed themselves of farm household support: people are terrified that if they take it they will have to pay it back, eventually sell their homes and get a $45,000 exit grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this package caters for about 6,500 people, it is not an adequate package. There are very many&mdash;up to 50 per cent&mdash;woolgrowers who are not receiving any assistance at all and they desperately need that assistance. Therefore, I believe that when Mr Crean goes out and makes statements that there is help, that there is assistance from the Government, he is not completely telling the facts as they are. While he is correct in some ways, in that there is assistance for people who have to exit, that assistance is not helping people stay on the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Senator Sherry or those in the advisers' box can correct me on my next point because I would love to be proven wrong on it, but I do not think I am. I believe that up to 50 per cent of woolgrowers who are in desperate straits and need interest rate subsidies are not receiving those subsidies. These two packages, in effect, top up the already existing clients of RAS and lift their interest rate subsidy from 50 per cent to 75 per cent or even, on some occasions, 100 per cent. As I said before, if Senator Sherry has received some advice to prove me wrong and if he can assure me that that interest rate subsidy is flowing to the wool producers who are in need of it, I will be the happiest person in the Senate. I know that the hour is late and that we have a couple of extra Bills to get through, but if Senator Sherry can allay my fears on that point, I will be very grateful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to deal with a number of matters in terms of the debate tonight. Firstly, I thank those senators who have taken part in this debate. I know that the last speaker, Senator Boswell, is quite ill. It is a mark of his commitment that he took part in the debate, given the difficult circumstances that I know he is in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the tenor of the debate tonight has been very positive. I intend to deal with points that have been raised by a number of speakers. I include in the positive comments the comments of my colleagues Senator Carr and Senator West. Senator West, who has been a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs with me, has had a longstanding interest in this area, as indeed have other senators opposite who are on that same committee, including Senator Calvert, a fellow Tasmanian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will deal briefly with the causes of the problems we face in the wool industry. I will then deal fairly briefly with the measures that the Government has proposed, some points made by speakers opposite and the reaction to the package proposed by the Government. Finally, I will make some comments about the theme of the amendment moved by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, in terms of the causes of the current problems of the wool industry, there is no doubt that the Australian Wool Corporation kept the price of wool too high for too long. There is no doubt that that is the primary reason we have the problems we have today. But let us be honest about it: all the politicians of all the political parties in both this place and the other place accepted that situation for a long time. All political parties supported the floor price scheme for almost 20 years. So when we are apportioning blame, we have to remember that it is all very well to look back at the circumstances surrounding the increasing of the floor price scheme, but very few politicians in either chamber envisaged what was going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is an international recession. I know that some people tend to scoff at the effect of the international recession, but there is no doubt that it has had a substantial effect on our wool markets. Coupled with that we have the situation in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc. Whilst I welcome the political and economic changes that are occurring there, they have certainly had unforeseen consequences for the demand for wool. We really face a quite serious problem in terms of what is happening in the former Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc. I have been reading some briefing notes on what is occurring in those areas. Unfortunately, much of our traditional wool market has been replaced by synthetics from other countries. That causes me some concern about our long-term prospects of regaining the market. We have also had some problems with contracts with China. I think they are the main reasons why we are in the situation we are in, and why we are debating this issue tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already commented about the lack of vision from all sides as to what was ahead, but I have been in contact with a Tasmanian woolgrower, a Mr McKenzie. I have a copy here of a local newspaper containing an article with the headline, `Wool crisis is looming' and written by a Mr McKenzie, who on 6 December 1989 rather accurately predicted what would happen. I will quote what he wrote in the article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having spent more than 40 years actively engaged in the wool industry, it is with much regret and sadness that I watch the potential, if not actual crisis, that may befall this great industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an active opponent of the floor price scheme at its inception, mainly because of the basic economic flaw that when you trade in the world arena there is no way you can continue to tell the markets what they must pay for your commodity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the reserve price scheme was first implemented, the price of wool was at such a low level that sheep numbers were falling and our competitors, such as synthetics, were getting squeezed by cost increases as a follow-on from the tremendous hike in oil prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the floor price plan to date in my opinion has been suspect and purely hypothetical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with any comparisons, there must be a `control' to measure it by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assume, however, that the scheme has had some success, the costs now can be potentially horrific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The floor price has long since departed from its original charter (due to the pressure from growers), to be just that, a floor price to become a price pusher.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on and it really is extremely accurate in predicting what would happen in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us tonight is but one part of the initiatives taken by the Government in a sound, solid and very broadly based package. I will not go into all the details, but the package is composed of four basic parts. Firstly, the Commonwealth is funding up to $44.6 million under the exceptional circumstance provisions of the rural adjustment scheme. I will return shortly to the contribution made by government above and beyond that. Secondly, the Government has determined that the wool tax will be maintained at 8.5 per cent for 1993 and 1994. Thirdly&mdash;and this is the central issue of tonight's legislation&mdash;there will be a restructuring of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's debt repayment schedule by extending the debt schedule from seven to eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Government has announced a review committee to be chaired by Professor Garnaut. I know Senator Boswell has some reservations about his background, but we should not concentrate too much on his attitudes to tariffs. I believe he is a very competent person, who, together with the other two members, Mr Rod Price and Mr Stephen Bennett, should be able to come up with some long-term measures and solutions in addition to what has been proposed by the Government to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) is to undertake an overseas trip. This is very important because today I noted some criticism in the media about overseas trips by politicians. Both sides of the Senate would recognise that these trips can play an important part, and Minister Crean's trip overseas will play an important part in helping to assess the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other people have put forward various measures. One suggestion is that we burn the wool stockpile. That is rather ironic, given that one of the great advantages of wool is that it does not burn. In fact, it would cost tens of millions of dollars to burn the wool stockpile. This was first proposed by a Frenchman. The second irony is in the nationality of the gentleman who proposed it&mdash;I forget his name&mdash;given the attitude of the French towards commodity prices and the support they give within the European Community. I was very concerned that such a far-sighted, responsible and dedicated premier as the Premier of Queensland, Mr Goss, picked up the suggestion. I thought that was particularly regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been other suggestions that it should be given away in the form of aid. Again, I think that is a little impractical. It would be very hard to track where the wool ended up, and I think it could well be a double-edged sword if it were given away. We have had suggestions from the CWA that it should be knitted. Certainly that would make some small contribution to reducing the wool pile, but I do not think it would address the central problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier the contributions under RAS. I have been informed that the Government underwriting through RAS of the total rural debt in this country&mdash;and I do not have the breakdown of the wool debt&mdash;is some $3.2 billion. I am not suggesting for one moment that there is a payout of $3.2 billion, but the underpinning of interest support on $3.2 billion is not an insubstantial amount of money that is being provided to the rural sector. I do not know the portion that is going to the wool industry, but it would be very substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the comments from the Opposition tonight, I welcome Senator Tambling's general contribution. He said that the Federal Government could slacken the string controlling the Australian Wool Realisation Commission so that it could better market the wool. I have already outlined that the package does include a review by Professor Garnaut, and hopefully that will include a review of marketing arrangements. I would like to make a comment here on the marketing of wool. It is not necessarily money that is spent on the marketing of wool. I am informed that over the last 10 years $1.2 billion has been spent on various aspects of wool marketing. That is an amazing figure. If we have spent all this money, what has been the result? It really is quite astounding. Of that, $277 million has been contributed by Government. So we have spent an enormous amount of money on marketing, but it has not necessarily been the solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding some of the other contributions, again, Senator Panizza's was generally positive. He challenged the notion that greedy woolgrowers had led to the current situation. I do not for one moment suggest on behalf of the Government that it is the fault of greedy woolgrowers. I have to say that if any of us were in the circumstances of woolgrowers where we were being offered a higher price for what we were producing, I do not think too many of us would knock that higher price back. I do not think any of us would knock it back. He made the point that the scheme was compulsory, but there were not too many woolgrowers clamouring to get out of the compulsory scheme because of the prices they were receiving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza made the point that the Government should make a greater contribution&mdash;without being specific about what the contribution should be&mdash;but I made the point earlier about the contribution through RAS of the underpinning of the support of $3.2 billion. Regarding our non-traditional markets and marketing, Senator Panizza referred to eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. I have alluded to some of the problems that we face in getting back into that market. It will be particularly difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that Senator Campbell's comments concerning the bureaucracy in the wool industry are probably right. I think he has a good point that there are so many vested interests and such a significant bureaucracy that supposedly is looking after the wool industry, and yet it seems to have not been doing a particularly effective job. Certainly I think that is one of the areas which needs a total review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation we have today is a pretty damning indictment of the various bodies in the wool industry, not to mention the various leaders of the wool industry. I referred to a media article earlier. I will not embarrass Mr Lempriere or Mr Cleland by further quoting what they said about the problems we were not going to face in terms of the wool stockpile. Unfortunately, I think there was a lack of vision by some of the persons in the wool industry at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree totally with Senator Campbell and a number of other speakers who commented that this crisis is affecting the entire community. I have been to rural and regional areas as a member of the rural and regional affairs committee and, recently, in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. There is no doubt that the wool crisis is ricocheting through the entire rural community and industry. It is affecting not just the woolgrowers and their families; it is also affecting small country communities and rural Australia as a whole. Ultimately, it will have a very substantial effect on our balance of payments and, in turn, the entire economy and community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that Senator Calvert approached the Minister about some positive contacts that he had made with the Latvian Government in an attempt to sell wool. I am glad to see that Senator Calvert made such a positive contribution to the debate. Senator Watson referred to fewer bodies administering the wool industry. I think he picked up the theme to which Senator Campbell referred. Senator Watson raised a new issue that should be remembered; that is, the two stockpiles that we face&mdash;the official one and the unofficial one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us tonight is relatively simple. It increases the amount of time for the sale of the stockpile from 7 years to 8 years. That is a responsible measure. We cannot extend the debt repayment period indefinitely. That would simply compound many of the problems that we face. The Opposition has suggested that we extend the debt, but that simply would not address the problem. Being conscious of the time, I conclude by suggesting that the legislation should be supported. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate too long at this late hour to consider the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill 1993 and related Bills. Basically, the purpose of these Bills is to give effect to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971. The subsequent legislation to ratify Australia's compliance with this international convention basically means that nine Australian oil companies which import into Australia 150 tonnes of contributing oil per year will be required to pay a combined total in the current year of $138,000, and just over a half a million dollars annually, to an international fund which will ensure that, in the event of a catastrophe involving oil spilt from an oil tanker, we will receive compensation of up to half a billion dollars to help in the cleaning up of oil spills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia there has been wide public attention drawn to the potential for oil spill disasters in recent times with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki </EMPHASIS>disaster off the north-west coast of my home State of Western Australia. Not so long ago there was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez </EMPHASIS>disaster off Alaska which cost in excess of $1 billion for the initial clean-up, with estimates of up to $4.2 billion to date for economic loss and long-term damage from that spill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition supports the passage of this Bill and the principle of ensuring protection of the sea generally. I am sure all honourable senators, all members of this Parliament and most Australians would agree that we need to ensure that not only are there sensible incentives upon those who carry oil at sea&mdash;those who export, import and trade in oil&mdash;but also sensible incentives aimed at avoiding disasters in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of compensation after a shipping accident needs to be looked at. More importantly, the Government and all members of Parliament need to ensure that we have a sensible set of laws in place to ensure prevention of any offshore oil disaster. As the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, has made clear on a number of occasions, particularly during Question Time, these matters naturally fall into the realms of international treaties and agreements. We all know&mdash;particularly as a result of the recent inquiry and report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that we do have disasters waiting to happen off the shores of nations all around the world. There is a rapidly ageing fleet of oil carriers, flag of convenience ships, very lax regulations internationally with ships registered in Liberia and Panama, rapidly ageing, out-of-date and lower level technology in the area of navigation and problems concerning the accreditation of skippers, navigational skills and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very hard for a nation as small as Australia to have much influence in this area. By ratification of this treaty and enactment through legislation, we are playing a small but important part in committing ourselves to the important principle of trying to prevent oil spills and disasters and ensuring that there is an international fund for compensation of oil pollution damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians live near the coastline and we all value the quality of the coastal environment for our own recreational and economic purposes. Australia can count itself lucky that we have yet to suffer the serious consequences of an oil disaster of the nature of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez </EMPHASIS>disaster off Alaska. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki </EMPHASIS>incident last year was a reminder that we are very vulnerable; we have a long coast and a lot of shipping movement off our coast. There is an enormous tonnage of oil travelling up and down the shipping passage between the Great Barrier Reef and the mainland of Queensland. It is absolutely crucial that Australia does everything it can to ensure that we minimise the risk of a disaster and have the infrastructure in place so that if such a disaster takes place it can be controlled and cleaned up. I am reliably informed that we do not have in place the sort of infrastructure we require so that, in the event of some disaster, we can limit it very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sanko Harvest </EMPHASIS>disaster off the south-west coast of Esperance&mdash;it did not involve oil; it was a large bulk carrier handling wheat&mdash;there was enormous indecision and bureaucratic bungling in trying to ensure that relief and rescue operations got down to the remote coast off Esperance very quickly. If that had been an oil disaster, it could have despoiled a very important section of the Australian coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the Opposition supports the passage of this Bill. We certainly support more preventative measures by the Government to ensure that we do not have an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS>-type disaster or a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>-type disaster occurring off the Australian coast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill will improve the compensation and liability regime for oil pollution in Australian waters. It will give effect to the 1971 International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage and to the subsequent protocols to the convention which have increased liability limits. It refers specifically to the carriage of oil in tankers into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation is so grossly inadequate that any improvement has to be seen as a major step forward. The Australian Democrats certainly support this package of Bills. However, the convention and associated protocols are not as stringent as they ought to be and certainly do not represent international best practice. The amount of compensation that could be claimed under the convention, as amended by the 1992 protocol, is still woefully inadequate when contrasted with the cost of the clean-up of a major oil spill. Senator Campbell has already mentioned that it cost $1 billion for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> clean-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been relatively lucky so far, given our huge coastline and the volume of traffic passing along it, particularly in certain areas. We can refer here to the 2,000 large ships which pass through the Great Barrier Reef each year, including more than 100 tankers carrying crude oil, petrol and diesel. I said in a press release earlier this year in response to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Braer</EMPHASIS> oil spill off the coast of the Shetland Islands that only good luck had prevented a similar accident on the Australian coast. Should it happen, and again I reflect the words of Senator Campbell a few moments ago, it seems as though our ability to get to those sites quickly and prevent serious damage is woefully limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics estimates that there is a 48 per cent chance of a major oil spill from tankers in Australian waters over the next five years and a 93 per cent chance over the next 20 years. In other words, there is roughly a fifty-fifty chance that a major oil spill will happen in Australia in the reasonably near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has certainly made some significant changes to regulations to improve ship safety in recent years. One of these has been the introduction of compulsory pilotage in that part of the Great Barrier Reef between Cairns and the tip of Cape York. Given that the Torres Strait and the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef have the highest accident rate in Australian waters, this was a very welcome move. However, the system only applies to the northern half of this inner route. Treacherous and hazardous areas in the Torres Strait and further south along the reef also need to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second change was to adopt amendments under the MARPOL agreement to make double hulls mandatory for tankers and to eventually phase out single hulls. Although the effectiveness of double hulls has been surrounded by controversy internationally, the Democrats nonetheless believe that this is a positive step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes highlight the fact that the best approach to combat oil pollution at sea is to set in place stringent preventive measures&mdash;that is, prevention rather than attempting to pay the cost of clean-up after a spill has occurred. Australia has in place a national plan and a reef plan specifically designed to cope with a spill in the Great Barrier Reef. However, the reef plan is being revised to cope with an oil spill of only 10,000 tonnes. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> spilt 17,700 tonnes off the coast of Western Australia in July 1992; the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> spewed some 36,000 tonnes into the pristine Prince William Sound in March 1989; and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Braer</EMPHASIS> spilt roughly 60,000 tonnes of oil into an area renowned for its wildlife. Clearly, there is potential for a very large spill. The plan is inadequate and should be upgraded, because there is a very real threat in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prevention also requires that the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame: inquiry into ship safety</EMPHASIS> report be implemented without delay. The report has been highly praised by interested parties and deserves international recognition. Whilst rust buckets and `lepers of the sea', as Senator Collins so aptly described the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, traverse Australian waters, even the toughest liability and compensation provisions could not prevent a serious pollution accident from occurring in our waters. A strict international regimen is, however, extremely important. As long as we maintain our addiction to oil, and as long as there remains an international shipping trade in this non-renewable resource, accidents will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the Bills before the Senate. The Democrats have some concerns over the stringency of the regimen contained in the relevant international conventions. Firstly, the fund convention, as amended by the 1992 protocol, does not make compensation available for damage to natural resources where these resources are not traded in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution stating that the assessment of compensation `is not to be made on the basis of an abstract quantification of damage calculated in accordance with theoretical models'. The assembly established a special working group to explore this issue. It found that compensation for environmental damage could only be granted where the claimant sustained quantifiable economic loss. We believe that is a defect in the present system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a very strict interpretation of damage and did not allow compensation for non-traded natural resources. The 1992 protocol to amend the fund convention addresses this issue further; it uses the definition of `pollution damage' contained in the 1992 protocol to amend the civil liability convention. The latter document has an improved definition of pollution damage. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . compensation for impairment of the environment other than loss of profit from such impairment shall be limited to costs of reasonable measures of reinstatement actually undertaken or to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>This new definition avoids the task of quantifying the decline in value of a natural resource as a result of an oil spill, but it continues to limit liability for natural resource damage. The key issue that has not been addressed in the protocol, and hence in this legislation, is the problem of assessing the monetary value of loss of aesthetic value, wildlife or ecological systems that have no economic value. Mans Jacobsson, the Director of the IOPC fund, actually said that `the marine environment does not have a direct economic value'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is essentially one of property rights. Property rights tend to be either deficient or non-existent for clean water or clean air, and too costly to enforce when they do exist. The fund assembly, along with shipowners and insurers, has clearly rejected the notion of compensation for other, more ecologically oriented, economic values such as option and existence values. Admittedly, these are very difficult to define. The Resource Assessment Commission has made some progress on this issue by conducting surveys using the contingency valuation method, which was used during the Kakadu inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impractical to expect that this kind of definition of pollution damage to natural resources will be adopted in the very near future in any further protocols amending the convention. However, the US Oil Pollution Act of 1990 does provide some guidance as to how an improved definition could be used. The OPA 1990 allows for the cost of restoration, rehabilitation or replacement, plus the diminution in value of resources pending restoration. The diminution of value aspect contrasts significantly with the limited definition in the 1992 protocol. The OPA 1990 also provides that the cost of assessing harm to natural resources is added to the total cost to ensure that natural resource damage cases do not fail merely because funding for assessments is unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is also major doubt over whether indigenous people would be able to use the convention to claim for loss of natural resources where the legal ownership of the natural resources is in doubt. This bears very much on the Mabo case. If a local community hunts or gathers food as a livelihood, there is no guarantee that the community would be able to claim for the loss of untraded goods&mdash;that is, goods in which there was not a dollar value.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, where a community uses a natural resource for cultural or spiritual reasons there would be no recourse for compensation. In contrast, the OPA of 1990 specifically allows Indian tribes and foreign governments to recover damages through legal action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the compensation limits set out in the protocol are too restrictive. The amount of compensation available under the new legislation will immediately increase to some $120 million, according to the Minister's second reading speech. We will have to wait at least five years for this amount to be raised to $400 million depending on when the 1992 protocol comes into force. It is worth restating the fact that the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics estimates that there is a fifty-fifty chance of a major oil spill from tankers in Australian waters in the next five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the US OPA-90 established a federal oil spill liability trust fund which allows compensation of up to $1 billion per incident. Of this amount, $500 million can be paid for damage to natural resources. In addition, $1 billion can be authorised by the federal fund. Although this seems a very high limit, it is sobering to remember that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> spent $US3 billion on cleaning up the Prince William Sound spill and a further $1 billion in settlement of law suits by the US federal and Alaskan governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the question of the limits to liability. The 1992 protocol to amend the civil liability convention states that a shipowner is not entitled to limit liability if it is proved that the pollution damage resulted from his or her own act committed with intent to cause damage, or recklessly and knowing that damage would result. This definition is far too strict. The US OPA-90 allows for unlimited liability where gross negligence or wilful misconduct occurs on the part of the responsible party or the party's agent, employee or contractee. Gross negligence allows for liability other than that contained in the 1992 protocol amending the civil liability convention. The 1992 protocol amending the fund convention does not allow unlimited liability as the protocol relates to oil importers rather than shipowners; however, the issue of whether importers of oil should be made jointly liable for damages, rather than shipowners alone, is a matter which should be given consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are keen to see that this package of Bills is referred to the Senate standing committee in such a way that a number of groups wanting to give evidence to that committee will be able to appear before it. Under the present terms of reference to the committee that is not possible, so at the end of this speech I will be moving an amendment to the terms of reference to the committee. The Democrats do not believe, however, that at this stage there is any likelihood of any amendments being forthcoming to this legislation. We are quite happy for it to go ahead at this second reading stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support an approach which will offer the greatest protection to the Australian coastline as well as the best regime for liability and compensation. No doubt a US-style Bill in Australia would be bitterly opposed by the oil, shipping and insurance industries; however, ultimately, it must be the protection of the marine and coastal environment and the establishment of strict avenues of justice for parties affected by a major spill which are accorded the highest priority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The possibility of oil pollution in Australian waters has not been considered a great risk by many in the oil industry or in some Federal government departments until very recently. An indication of a change of attitude on this question is the package of legislation that we are debating here tonight. Certainly the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame </EMPHASIS>program which so vividly examined the issue on commercial television recently, points to the enormous risks that are placed on the coastline of Australia every day due to the shipping of petroleum and petroleum products in Australian coastal waters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this package of legislation, which implements the provisions of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971, is an integral part of the international and national legislative program that has been established to ensure that safety standards are maintained and that compensation is available to third parties when pollution damage occurs. However, it is disappointing that after all these years this legislation is now being pushed through at the last opportunity to enable Australia to comply with its international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation and other legislation associated with the International Maritime Organisation and the oil industry is very complex and requires careful scrutiny to ensure that the interests of all Australians as well as the Australian environment are protected by their provisions. Senator Coulter has already gone through some of the complex and important questions that need to be addressed. I will not go over them at this point, but I do intend to support the referral to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which I hope will have an opportunity to engage in a further discussion of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has an enormous coastline on this island continent, together with fragile ecosystems such as mangroves and, of course, important reef systems such as the ones at Ningaloo and the Great Barrier Reef. We need to ensure that the legislation that is designed to protect the coastline and provide compensation to those whose lives will be affected by pollution damage is comprehensive and appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore think that the proposal to refer this legislation to the Senate Standing Committee is to be commended. I hope that this will allow sufficient time to enable proper public consultation on this issue, as I am aware that some members of the community would welcome the opportunity to express their concerns about the issues associated with this legislation. In that regard, I support the delay of the reporting of the committee's findings until the first day of the Budget session in order to facilitate that consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I cite an article by Michael White, QC, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS> of March 1993 entitled `Oil pollution in the Australian and New Zealand Region'. He points out very appropriately that government and departmental inquiries usually follow after disasters, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What would be more beneficial for Australia and New Zealand would be an adequately funded, wide ranging inquiry into marine pollution generally and oil spills in particular. The experience from other countries suggests that this will only occur after there has been a major casualty.

<PARA>The very recent example of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> disaster off the coast of Western Australia has already been mentioned. A very fortunate series of events involving wind direction and currents carried the oil away from the coast and averted a disaster of mammoth proportions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1993 is not opposed by the Opposition. One might say, `Well thank you very much. You can sit down', but I would like to make a few brief remarks. The Bill seeks to remedy a constitutional defect in the Bankruptcy Act 1966, as amended only recently in this chamber. If the Act is not amended in accordance with this Bill, the process of collecting compulsory contributions from bankrupts will be weakened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill, which we are dealing with now, and which amends the Bankruptcy Act, seeks to fix this constitutional defect I have referred to. It came into effect in 1991 under the compulsory income contribution regime introduced at the time. Under that regime, a trustee is able to make an assessment of the income that a bankrupt is likely to derive during the period of bankruptcy. Where the income is assessed at being above a certain level or threshold, the bankrupt is liable to make contributions from his or her income of 50c in each dollar above that amount. A particular section of the Bankruptcy Act enables a trustee to file a certificate in a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of amounts of these compulsory contributions which a bankrupt has refused or failed to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill which made amendments to the Act in 1991 provided that such a certificate would operate and would be enforceable as if it were a final judgment of the court in which it had been filed. It is that section that this Bill seeks to amend. The reason is this: the validity of that section is being challenged in the High Court, and the Government believes that challenge will be successful. If it is successful, then the income contribution regime of bankrupts will be put at risk. So it seems appropriate that we make the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge rests on the trustee's certificate being given the status of a judgment of the relevant court, thereby allegedly allowing a person who does not hold judicial office to exercise judicial power in that the trustee files this certificate and it is then a judgment of the court. That defect will be remedied when this Bill is passed. The trustee will still be able to file a certificate stating the nature of the debt and the amount owed, and in any proceedings that are instituted that certificate will be prima facie evidence of those things, but not a judgment as though proceedings had been carried and decided in favour of the trustee. In other words, in order to get a judgment, proceedings will have to be carried out. The trustee will not have, in effect, the capacity to make a judgment of a relevant court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention this only because it is a fundamental issue in a few lines of a Bill that was not picked up here. I notice that Senator Foreman tabled the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Alert Digest</EMPHASIS> of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills a few minutes ago. I happen to be on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, and it did not so adequately scrutinise the bankruptcy amendments in 1991 to pick up this problem. Nor did anyone in this chamber pick it up. The reason it was not picked up is that, as has happened every November-December since I have been in Parliament&mdash;that is, since 1985&mdash;a huge number of Bills suddenly appears out of I do not know where and these have to be considered in a rush. Every year we on this side&mdash;and I am told it has been the same when we have been in government, so I do not make these remarks in any partisan sense&mdash;say, `This is ridiculous; mistakes will be made'. And every year the Government says, `You are a bunch of incompetents. You have held up our program. You are responsible for all of this. We want these Bills'. So a guillotine is introduced and through they go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of dealing with legislation like that, of rushing things through, is that fundamental mistakes like this are made. If we add up the salaries of all these people here, the cost of running this whole show&mdash;I use that word not to denigrate the place but just to be inclusive of everybody involved&mdash;the taxpayer is entitled to say, `What are you doing? Two years later you are fixing up a fundamental mistake. As soon as it is pointed out to you it is as obvious as the days are long. It should jump out from the page at any of us. The reason you have made that mistake is that you will not slow down and give legislation the proper consideration it deserves'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel quite sure that if the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills had been given a longer period in which to consider this Bill, it would have picked up the mistake. I feel confident that if this chamber had been given a greater opportunity to consider this Bill, this mistake would have been picked up. I am not simply saying that if we slow down we will find these problems and fix them&mdash;the taxpayer is entitled to be annoyed that we have not done that&mdash;I want to add to that the cost of this kind of mess-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know who will pay for these High Court proceedings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go so far as to say that this is a disgrace,  but we all had the opportunity to spot this error and none of us did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to detain the Senate overly long. However, I feel that I ought to make a few comments on the Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1993 at the second reading stage. The intention of the Bill is to rectify a technical problem with the existing legislation. As Senator Vanstone has said, the technical problem is that, under the current legislation, a trustee who makes a determination as to the contribution which a bankrupt should make is making a judicial decision without being a judicial officer. For a long time it has been accepted that a trustee in bankruptcy is an officer of the court, but that is very different from being a judicial officer, because the trustee does not have judicial power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of suggestions in relation to this process. I still feel that we do not have it right. The reason why we do not have it right is simply this: the amendments before us tonight will make the certificate of the trustee prima facie evidence of the amount which the bankrupt has an obligation to contribute. The consequence of this amendment is that an application still has to be made to the court, because that is the competent authority. That, of course, costs money. The reason why trustees are generally very unsuccessful in getting contributions from bankrupts is simply that in many cases they are appointed to an estate that does not have any money in it, especially in complex cases where the bankrupt has so arranged his affairs that, at the date of the appointment of the trustee, there are not even any realisable assets or apparently realisable assets that will put money into the trustee's hands so that he can then proceed to carry out a proper investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention behind the original amendment to the Act, which we had in 1991, was to streamline the process so that a trustee could get a determination of a bankrupt's obligation to pay without having to go to the expense of commencing an action in the Federal Court or in the Supreme Court, say, in Queensland, under cross-vesting legislation. What we now have is a halfway house. I understand&mdash;and Minister Bolkus may correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the trustee still has an obligation to commence an action and to make an application to the court. All this legislation does is reduce the evidentiary obligations of the trustee upon making the application. The best way these particular matters can be resolved is in the same way in which the Act currently deals with the continuing effect of bankruptcy after the normal three-year discharge period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators know, a bankrupt is automatically discharged after a period of three years. When Senator Tate was Minister he made changes to the Act such that a bankrupt could be discharged early if it was shown, under certain circumstances, that the person concerned had adequately, sufficiently and in good faith discharged his obligations as a bankrupt under the Act and there was no public policy reason for maintaining him in bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also changes made to keeping bankrupts in bankruptcy longer. But the underlying principle of discharge from bankruptcy was not displaced. That principle is that a trustee generally can object to the discharge of a bankrupt by lodging an objection to discharge with the registrar in bankruptcy of the Federal Court in the jurisdiction in which the sequestration order was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that an appropriate way to deal with this may well be that a trustee in bankruptcy makes an application to the registrar for a declaration along similar terms that the bankrupt has an obligation to contribute a certain amount of money per week, per month or per annum. That declaration can then be overturned by an application, by the bankrupt or on the bankrupt's behalf, to the court itself so that the trustee is not actually making a judicial decision. The effect of that would be to enable trustees to quickly get an obligation from the bankrupt to make a contribution, and then it rests upon the bankrupt to make an application to the court to vary that determination or set it aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bankrupt is able to get legal aid, but a trustee in bankruptcy, who is appointed to an estate that has no assets or no apparent realisable assets, cannot get legal aid to bring the application to court, notwithstanding the fact that the application may well be for the benefit of numerous creditors as individuals. Of course the argument could be made that the trustee would have a right to get money under section 305 of the Act from the former office of Inspector-General in Bankruptcy which is now ITSA&mdash;the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with that is that section 305 funding for trustees is very limited. Some five or six years ago moneys were easily obtainable by trustees under section 305, but as a result of urging from the then Inspector-General of Bankruptcy, Mr Wenn, there were a flood of applications under section 305, and as a result it is now very difficult to get funding under section 305 of the Act. We cannot say that it is easy for the trustee to make an application; it is actually very difficult. The reason I say all of these things is that frequently there are cases where the estate is very complex and there are no apparent realisable assets but where the bankrupt still has a strong earning stream that derives from various investments or other business activities associated with the bankrupt and where it is not possible to succeed under the trust busting provisions that were introduced into the Act 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hate to say this to the chamber, but I think we may not have it right yet and I think some further consideration needs to be given. I am loathe to say that for the simple reason that we have changed the Bankruptcy Act so many times in the past couple of years that it is getting very difficult for the profession adequately to administer the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it is more difficult for a trustee in bankruptcy to administer the Act than it is for an ordinary accountant practising in some other area of accountancy is that in accountancy generally there are clients who are volunteers in their fate. But in the case of bankruptcy, where a private trustee is appointed, the situation almost invariably arises where bankrupts are anything but a volunteer in their fate. In those few cases where the bankrupt has presented a debtor's petition and a private trustee in bankruptcy has been appointed, frequently the allegation is made that the trustee is going to go soft on the bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very, very difficult for a trustee to actually enforce the Act when many changes are made. Because bankrupts are not willing participants in their own bankruptcy, they frequently look for every possible avenue to avoid compliance with the Act. That is why the Act has to be simple and that is why we have to minimise the number of changes that are made. Over the next 12 to 18 months we will probably see more changes to the Act. I would only hope that, when those changes occur, they are comprehensive and properly done, and that the Act is then left as it is so that the profession can get on with the job of administering the Act as it is intended, to the benefit of the general public. Proper administration of bankruptcy is very important for the business community, for confidence and for ensuring the economy functions properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter that I raised today in Question Time. It is a matter which not many people would be aware of but one which is of vital importance to Australia's rural communities. This matter relates to sales tax paid by primary producers and farm machinery dealers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may be aware that primary producers can register with the Tax Office for exemption from sales tax. The intention is that our farmers, who contribute so much to our export earnings as well as our quality of life, will not be burdened by sales tax when buying goods for use in primary production. In addition, farm machinery dealers can register with the Tax Office for an exemption from paying sales tax, on the basis that they are selling mainly to exempt primary producers, and this is commonsense. If a farmer can buy goods from a supplier and not pay sales tax, it makes sense that the farm machinery dealer who sells almost exclusively to primary producers can buy those same goods free of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I, along with many senators, fought to ensure that under the new sales tax legislation the right of farm machinery dealers to register for exemption was retained. We fought so that dealers already suffering a massive downturn in business due to the rural recession would not have to pay an extra cost that they said would put them out of business. So it saddens me to have to bring to the attention of the Senate an apparent anomaly in the current sales tax legislation which means that our rural communities will contribute an extra $10 million a year in sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this new streamlined sales tax system, which is a contradiction in terms, is that farm machinery dealers, and ultimately primary producers, will end up paying sales tax on reconditioned farm machinery. This is because dealers must pay sales tax on spare parts bought to recondition farm machinery. A farmer buying a spare part to repair a tractor or any other piece of machinery can buy that spare part free of sales tax but the farm machinery dealer must pay sales tax. Who will the dealer most likely sell a second-hand tractor or harvester to? A sales tax exempt primary producer, of course. The end result is that dealers will put up the price of reconditioned farm machinery by the amount of sales tax that they have to pay on those spare parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One dealer has told me that he spends an average of $3,000 reconditioning each piece of second-hand farm machinery that is traded in. It is not uncommon for a dealer to spend $10,000 reconditioning a header. Sales tax applied at 20 per cent means an extra $2,000 per second-hand header. Because of the reduced number of dealerships in the country now, even if a dealer sells only 50 reconditioned headers a year, on average he will have to pay out $100,000 in sales tax, which cannot be refunded. I use this case as an example to stress the seriousness of the situation for all rural Australians. How many farmers in Australia at present can afford to pay an extra $2,000, or anything extra, for a second-hand piece of machinery? How many dealers can afford to absorb an extra $100,000 in sales tax?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office was first alerted to this apparent anomaly in the sales tax legislation when we contacted many dealers throughout rural South Australia to inquire how the new system was working. We were told that dealers were confused about the new system because it was poorly implemented and poorly explained. These dealers had each implemented the streamlined sales tax system differently. All dealers expressed fear of an audit in case they had got it wrong. One dealer complained that he had used three systems over the last three months and he still was not sure whether he had got it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, this situation is now being clarified and at last information is getting through to dealers; however, I cannot be so positive about the situation regarding sales tax on spare parts. Because of the downturn in the rural economy, the price of new machinery is out of the reach of many farmers and they now look to reliable reconditioned machinery. Naturally, the proportion of second-hand machinery sold by farm machinery dealers has increased. Anyone who has seen the statistics that have been released in the last few days will realise just how much they have increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One dealer on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula&mdash;an area that over the past three years, during this rural recession, has suffered greatly due to drought, high interest rates and the fall in commodity prices&mdash;has told me that 75 per cent of the machinery he sells now is second-hand. Farm machinery dealers provide an invaluable service to farmers across Australia. They sell new and used agricultural machinery to farmers as well as provide parts and maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a normal part of business, dealers buy used machinery such as tractors and harvesters from farmers as a trade-in on new machinery. Dealers have to recondition that traded-in stock to make it acceptable to a prospective buyer. Some repairs are only minor but, because farmers and primary producers are holding on to their machinery for much longer, most of the traded-in machinery requires major repairs and a substantial outlay by the dealer, who has no guarantee that that piece of machinery will be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think I need to spell out how farm machinery dealers across Australia have reacted to the news that they will have to pay sales tax on all spare parts used to recondition second-hand machinery. It is of little comfort to them that the Australian Taxation Office has advised the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia that sales tax is payable because dealers are using the parts for the business's own use and the parts have not been sold directly to a sales tax exempt primary producer. As with everything else the dealer stocks, the spare parts could be sold directly to the primary producer free of sales tax. There is not even a chance of a refund of the sales tax when the machinery is sold to an exempt primary producer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting through it all; do not worry. Farm machinery dealers must carry the cost and pass it on to farmers. I think we all know that dealers cannot afford to carry the cost. The whole situation is ridiculous because the dealer will ultimately end up selling the reconditioned equipment to an exempt farmer. Surely it is perfectly logical that a dealer buying spare parts to recondition machinery which will be sold to a tax exempt primary producer should not pay sales tax on these parts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government gave assurances through a Senate committee that no additional sales tax would be imposed on farm machinery dealers, but there is no doubt that dealers will be forced to pass on the cost of this sales tax impost to the primary producers. This indirect tax will cost Australian farmers an estimated extra $10 million a year. This is a conservative estimate. Try explaining that to farmers in New South Wales and Queensland, who are experiencing drought, or to farmers in South Australia, who are currently desperately waiting for rain to sow their crops. As I said, this $10 million figure is only a conservative estimate that has been provided to me by the Tractor and Machinery Association. With the increasing number of farmers buying second-hand machinery, it is only feasible that this figure will rise considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot stress enough the importance of the farm machinery dealers to farmers across Australia. Australian farmers are some of the most efficient in the world and in order to maintain this efficiency they need a support network of manufacturers and dealers. Dealers not only provide a valuable service to farming communities, but they also provide jobs in country centres throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm machinery dealers have suffered alongside farmers in this rural crisis. Figures from the Farm Machinery Dealers Association show that the number of dealers in Australia has declined from 2,400 in 1986 to approximately 600 at the current time, which is almost a quarter of the number of dealers that there were in 1986. This is not surprising when one looks at the drop in sales of machinery in the 1980s. In 1983 there were 1,685 retail sales of combine harvesters&mdash;that is, both power take-off and self-propelled harvesters&mdash;in Australia. In 1992, this figure had dropped to 450, which was actually an improvement on the disastrous figure of 1991 when only 220 machines were sold Australia wide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost 12,000 tractors were sold in 1983 and only 5,798 were sold in 1991. Overall, 16,500 people have been lost from farm machinery dealerships across Australia since 1984. That is 16,500 people our rural communities could not afford to lose and 16,500 people our unemployment queues could not afford to gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics released by the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia for the first quarter of this year indicate that the industry is once again facing a tough year for tractor and farm equipment sales. After some signs of recovery in 1992, this year's opening quarter is little better than in 1991, the worst year on record for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward with interest to the TMA's state of the industry report due for release next Thursday, 27 May, at the association's annual conference in Canberra. The report is expected to predict a conservative outlook for tractor sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The downturn in farm machinery sales has implications for agriculture as a whole. Farmers are aware of the vital role that machinery plays in supporting agriculture and the effect that modern equipment has on farm productivity. The Government must also recognise this connection. The TMA is concerned that several years of dismal sales have caused a major downturn within the farm machinery industry and the survival of its remaining manufacturing and service base looks very fragile. The TMA's president, Mr John Henchy, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constructive, long term planning for the recovery of Australian agriculture and some incentives for farmers to invest in modern equipment are badly needed.</PARA>
<PARA>However, far from giving incentives, all the Government has given the industry is a new tax worth $10 million. If this causes more farm machinery dealers to close, even more farmers will be left with a depleted service. Not only will they have to travel further to their dealer, but also their productivity will also drop because they will have to wait longer for spare parts and service when their machinery breaks down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian farmers have always prided themselves on their efficiency compared to the rest of the world. But we risk falling behind other countries if we let farm machinery dealers go out of business and we allow farm machinery to run down further. The Tractor and Machinery Association has sent three letters to the Federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) about this situation. Apparently this issue is not deemed important enough even for a reply. I call on the Government to respond to this matter immediately. This apparent sales tax anomaly is nothing more than a revenue collecting exercise, but it is one that will have tragic consequences unless it is removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Office has apparently been very helpful to the farm machinery industry, despite the confusion caused by the legislation. But the Tax Office has been powerless to act because it is the legislation that is at fault. I therefore call on the Government to immediately remove this extra $10 million burden on the farm machinery industry&mdash;a burden which any sane person would know cannot be carried by Australia's rural community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the opportunity of the first reading debate for the package of Bills dealing with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to deal with two matters. The first relates to today's report that Dr Geoff Chapman, described in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning as the hero of racing's anti-GST campaign, has quit the Sydney turf. He is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's a slow way of going broke.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is, in view of the economic conditions imposed on all industries, particularly the racing industry, by the recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Chapman is reported as considering his future on the Gold Coast, with a return to medicine most likely. As Dr Chapman, in my experience, listens entirely with an open mouth, he will have great difficulty in discovering his patients' symptoms unless he changes the style that, quite frankly, marked his disgraceful performance before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Chapman is quoted in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training racehorses just isn't economically viable.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet before the election he attacked the Opposition, and he is described by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> as `one of the most effective racing representatives' on the question of attacking the GST. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He received wide exposure, and was on Paul Keating's thank-you list the day after the election.</PARA>
<PARA>I might add that the Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, went to visit Dr Chapman's stables, the Lord Ben Lodge, after Dr Chapman had participated in one of the most disgraceful and dishonest political campaigns I have ever struck. He simply told lies and repeated those lies, and he knew them to be lies. I was pleased that the owner of those stables, Mr John Dunnon, dissociated himself from Mr Keating's visit and expressed his concern about what Mr Keating's economic policies and his Government had done both to racing and Mr Dunnon's interest in property which had in fact forced him to dispose of those stables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get the facts exactly right. Dr Geoff Chapman may have been the hero of racing's anti-GST fight as far as Mr Max Presnell of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> who wrote this morning's report is concerned, but he was a disgrace to those people who expect industry leaders to tell the truth. Dr Chapman's campaign against the GST was based on lies and distortion. The centrepiece of his campaign was his totally false claim that amateur owners&mdash;about 90 per cent of racehorse owners in Australia&mdash;would have to pay a GST on prize money. That was simply false. He knew it to be false and yet he kept on repeating it for the benefit of his mate, Mr Keating. Weeks before Dr Chapman came out with this politically based lie&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That kind of frivolous point of order is the sort of thing I expect from Senator Bolkus who does not have the capacity to recognise the truth. I am now telling the truth about a disgraceful and dishonest campaign in which Dr Chapman enjoyed participating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weeks before Dr Chapman came out with this politically based lie, with other leaders in the racing industry he had attended a meeting with me accompanied by an accountant who was advising the racing industry. This accountant had clearly explained to these racing industry leaders, including Dr Chapman&mdash;who, as I said, appeared to spend that time listening open-mouthed&mdash;that there would be no GST on prize money earned by amateur owners who make up more than 90 per cent of all owners in Australia. Because of that knowledge, no other leaders of the racing industry in Australia supported Dr Chapman's lies. They would not support him and that is why he was the outspoken hero. He was the only leader of that industry who kept on repeating that lie and kept on getting massive media cover for that lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This knowledge that it was a lie, told to him by his own industry's advising accountant, did not stop Dr Chapman from spreading it. It had the effect of making him look a hero while the other racing industry representatives were made to look like wimps for not participating in it. It was interesting to note that some newspapers, such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS>, found it attractive and interesting to run Dr Chapman's nonsense, but would not run with anything like the same enthusiasm the comments made by leading trainers like Tommy Smith, for example, who said that the industry would benefit overall from a GST. Here we have leading racing people saying that what Chapman was saying was absolute nonsense, his own accountant was telling him and yet he continued to repeat this kind of lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that racing under the Keating administration is being destroyed. At least Chapman is right to that extent. It is not economic. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training racehorses just isn't economically viable.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that under the GST the trainers of racehorses would have had all GST expenditures refunded to them. So Chapman was wrong on almost every score. Sure, there were some problems for some amateur owners, and there was no doubt that there was a need to address them, but there was certainly nothing like the sorts of problems that Chapman pretended were arising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that racing is being damaged seriously. Local and provincial race clubs are in serious financial difficulties, not because of anything the Federal Parliamentary Liberal Party has done, but basically because of what this Federal Government has done to the economy. That is why racing is in trouble. That is why Dr Chapman is being forced out of racing. That is why he will have to go back to medicine. I just want to say in conclusion that if ever there were a man who is deservedly reaping the proceeds of what he sowed, it is Dr Chapman. I hope that if he returns to medicine his integrity in that field will be a lot greater than it was in racing and in his political stunts to serve the interests of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to very briefly deal with another matter. Mr Deputy President, you will be aware that a notice of motion I gave to this chamber was ruled out of order on three grounds the day before yesterday. It was a notice which was supposed to be whimsical. It was, in fact, a poem which rewrote a verse about the Duke of Plaza-Toro from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gondoliers</EMPHASIS> written by W.S Gilbert. That verse in its original form seemed to me to be very appropriate to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) because it went like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In enterprise of martial kind,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When there was any fighting,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He led his regiment from behind&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He found it less exciting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when away his regiment ran,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His place was at the fore, O&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That celebrated,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cultivated,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Underrated</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobleman,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Duke of Plaza-Toro!</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the Minister was quite prepared to have his bureaucracy suffer the slings and arrows in this matter while he was safely in the rear&mdash;or was it safely in Darwin?&mdash;not reading, not understanding, not caring about what the documents actually said. I get the impression that when the trouble started he certainly was the first to depart, to say, `It is not my fault; it is someone else's'. Whatever the report today said about the fault of the department, I must say that it is incredible that no Minister would have asked the department, `Is there anything you should point out to me in this matter which is significant?' In any event, I changed this verse to read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In enterprise like Pay TV</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When there was any tendering</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He left the job to bureaucrats</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Especially by gendering</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And while he took his salary</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His staff all suffered rough-ups</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That error-maker, gross mistaker,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overweight incompetent</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for stuff-ups.</PARA>
<PARA>There is scope in this chamber for a bit of humour, sarcasm and reasonable whimsy. It did have a sharp touch, but are we not taking ourselves a bit seriously when we will not allow that kind of thing to appear in the record of the Parliament? It seems to me extraordinary that we are taking ourselves so seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that disturbs me about this place is the savagery, the nastiness and the unpleasant exchange, such as we have seen from Senator Bolkus tonight. There is no way one could pretend that that had an edge of humour, that it had any grace or that it had anything going for it except bad temper, irritation and a lack of most of the decencies that one would expect from a Minister of the Crown. </PARA>

The point I was trying to make before Senator Faulkner's gibberish was that surely there is scope in this place for a little bit of humour. I know that Senator Faulkner is a persistent joke in this chamber, but I want some real humour and I had hoped that this notice of motion would be seen as such.

But I would like to remind honourable senators, although only a few of us are here, that certain resolutions were agreed to by the Senate on 25 February 1988 in relation to parliamentary privilege.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have done on previous occasions, I wish to speak about the hours of sitting of this Senate. I know that I am compounding the ill, but the situation really has reached a crisis point in relation to the staff of this chamber and the staff of other parliamentary departments. Senator Chamarette may have some angst about the prolongation of the business of the Senate, but I would remind her that her predecessor attributed her leaving this place to stress-related diseases in relation to her performance as a senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not concerned, as I have said on previous occasions, about the senators themselves. I wish to refer to previous speeches that I have made in relation to this very serious matter: first on 5 May 1992, and subsequently on 12 November 1992. The Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 imposes a duty of care on Commonwealth employers to `provide a safe and healthy workplace for staff, and to design and plan work schedules which minimise any unwanted effects on the physical and psychological wellbeing of employees'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner, as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, has an obligation to ensure that these absurd working hours for the staff of this Senate are not continued. I believe that he shares my feelings about the Senate's hours of sitting. But there is an obligation. It seems absolutely incredible hypocrisy that this Government&mdash;which is composed of shop stewards, union representatives and former State secretaries of the Labor Party and which occupies the treasury bench&mdash;should impose on the people who work in this place work practices that any employer would be prosecuted for in the courts of the land. Yet, the Government is imposing these work practices not only on senators themselves but also on its own employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One may think that this is just the ravings of somebody who is trying to make a point that is perhaps of no great significance. I understand that these practices have gone on for years. I have been here three years and I have been approached by senators in a medical capacity to give advice on their stress-related disorders. I know that some senators from both sides of the chamber are suffering at the moment because this chamber has been sitting for three weeks. Yet here we are still sitting in the early hours of Friday morning. I understand that last week some estimates committees sat until 2.30 a.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1991 the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff engaged a consultant to review its working environment and work practices. The key consideration was the hours of duty worked by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters. I understand that some changes have been made to address this problem. In the 1991-92 annual report of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff there is a reference to the high number of claims submitted by staff during 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at 30 June 1992, the department had 16, or 4 1/2 per cent of the total staff, active compensation claims against it. That was an increase of six over the previous period. In other words, there are the equivalent of 16 full-time employees off at any one time within this department.  I have estimated the cost of compensation claims to be about $15,000 a week in relation to this department. This is much higher than any other industry that I am aware of. So, apart from anything else, there is a financial consideration to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Labour Organisation defines night work as `occupational activity during that period of the day usually reserved for sleep'. It actually defines the hours of night work. We are asking the employees&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> reporters, the Clerk and the deputy clerks of the Senate&mdash;to engage in night work beyond the definition of the International Labour Organisation. If that does not get through to the Labor Party, nothing will. Those opposite have to take cognisance of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only three reasons that the International Labour Organisation says are acceptable for night work: one is technical, in other words the continuous operation of industrial processes; the second is economic; and the third is social&mdash;for example, hospital workers, police and people who work for newspapers. Many people can acclimatise to this providing these conditions become an habitual part of their occupation. If they are not acclimatised to these situations, decreased well-being may be associated with night work and in up to 15 to 20 per cent of cases the symptoms actually progress to health disorders. Night work is the most difficult part of shift work and extended hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place we are asking people to start work at 10.00 a.m. and go right through until the early hours of the next day. It is interesting that many of the major disasters that have occurred in the world have occurred during night work periods. For instance, the Three Mile Island disaster, the Chernobyl accident and the Bhopal disaster all occurred during night work hours because the work had an effect on the health of the workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to see Senator Collins's behaviour today and his reactions through the week. Admittedly, I understand he is living on a lettuce leaf at the moment&mdash;he said that he has lost 17 kilograms. Not only is he hypoglycaemic, that is fairly obvious from his behaviour, but he also erects this wall of sound to counteract debate. If ever there were a wall of sound that becomes a primeval scream for help, Senator Collins is the best example I can give. He is emitting a primeval scream for help and the wall of sound is a reaction to the stress that he is under. He is obviously under stress. I commend the surrealist paintings that are going around at the moment to you, Mr Deputy President, because they give a fair example of what I am referring to in relation to Senator Collins. There are stress related disorders primarily related to this. They may help Senator Collins in some respects because they include reduced appetite, but they also cause sleep anomalies, nervous disorders, fatigue, gastric and digestive disorders, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Think of the effects on the social and family life of the people who work in this building. The feeling of being cut off from the community and of not participating in the social life and collective responsibilities that occur. That also happens  to senators. We have it in this whoopee land that is our work environment; we ourselves, and the people upon whom we inflict the way in which we behave. It prevents the formation of normal social contacts. Do not tell me that there is normal behaviour in relation to social contacts in this place when one comes in in the morning at about 8.00 a.m. and leaves, if one is lucky&mdash;and I again apologise that it is now nearly 12.30 a.m.&mdash;the following day. Mr Deputy President, what sort of social contact have you had today, other than controlling the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed one of the Ministers was sharing a bottle of wine with one of the reporters when he got called back here. I thought that he was doing pretty well, from what I observed of him in the dining room at the time. He has the reputation of doing pretty well in the dining room at times with some of the reporters. He got cut off in his prime&mdash;if that is the word&mdash;when the division bells rang.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No&mdash;does Senator Faulkner feel guilty? I would not expect that. There are effects on work performance as well. Normal humans are day oriented. I think that after habituation in this climate perhaps that could not be said of my colleagues because we become night oriented&mdash;in fact, disoriented&mdash;in this environment. It is a fact of life that there is a circadian rhythm within the human being. Most of our body's functions show maximal activity by day and minimal activity by night and it affects behaviour, alertness, reaction times and mental capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that politicians are worse off than shift workers because the night work and extended hours of work are not constant. We never quite know whether we are going to be here at midnight or whether we are going to be here at 3 a.m. We can even go on in an interrupted fashion not being aware as to what is going to occur from one moment to the next. This has been fairly evident in behaviour tonight with the adjournment being abrogated and then a disruption as to whether we were or were not going to have particular Bills debated. There is a problem associated not only with the extended hours of work and the inconstancy but also with the fact that politicians, in particular, do not have time to condition themselves to the conditions of work as do shift workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, people are not machines. We cannot expect these people who work within the confines of the department to turn on and turn off just as we switch the lights on and off. I note tonight that the Deputy Clerk of the Senate has been frequently coughing and needing to clear her throat. It is believed by many people that an illness is going through the department at the moment. I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, in most cases it is not at all physical. I have had to stave off people who want antibiotics for this illness. It is a classic stress-related disorder where people get run-down and start getting coughs and colds or similar symptoms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something has to be done.

The obligation is on the Government to control the business of the Senate so that this does not occur. I seize this opportunity tonight. It is very early in the legislative program; it is time to take remedial action before it becomes an absolute scandal, not only in relation to the stress-related disorders of the workers within this department but also in relation to the associated costs because, ultimately, the taxpayer will have to pay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Department does routinely disseminate media releases by the portfolio Ministers to organisations apart from the national media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department has a responsibility to advise interest groups, relevant associations and the wider community of matters affecting its programs and services. Such announcements are usually made by the Ministers and advised to interest groups and others by distribution of the media release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The releases are circulated by two methods:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Department engages the NewsNet organisation to fax broadcast the media release to interested organisations or individuals on the day of issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department maintains a composite of lists of organisations/individuals who have requested information about specific subjects. This list has about 850 listings, divided into 30 interest-group categories including journalists. The broadcast list for any media release depends on the subject of the release. It is unusual that any one media release broadcast would exceed 300 individual faxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) On a monthly basis the Department produces a summary of the media releases issued for that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The publication is mailed to 415 external and 83 internal organisations/individuals who can nominate which media release(s) they would like to receive. These are then mailed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) During the past 18-months Ministers issued 287 media releases. The cost of NewsNet for that period was about $71,000. For the period October 1991 to October 1992 the Department mailed out approximately every two months a publication of major media releases at a cost of about $2,000 an issue, including external printing and mail house costs. A new system was introduced in November 1992 and a summary of media releases is now prepared monthly. The approximate monthly cost of this is $85 for in-house printing and distribution. This gives a total of $83,425 for the 18 month period. Therefore the approximate average cost of distribution of each media release is $291.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Media releases are usually reproduced using general purpose photocopiers in the Department and the cost of printing media releases cannot be isolated from other reproduction costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Records are not kept on the distribution of each release. The distribution is individually tailored to the subject matter of the release. There has been no particular need to maintain records in such detail.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Department has no established mechanism for the distribution of speeches. Occasionally, in response to a specific request, a copy of a speech is mailed. As this is not a regular or frequent event no records are maintained. The cost is very small.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In his correspondence to the Prime Minister of 23 December 1991 and 15 July 1992, Mr Doohan claimed evidence existed to suggest a cover-up of the sinking of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Mr Doohan's correspondence to the Prime Minister on the loss of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> was referred to the Minister  for Defence for response, as the issues raised by Mr Doohan fell within the Defence portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Mr Doohan's facsimile dated 16 November 1992 to the Office of the Prime Minister referred to correspondence from the Minister for Defence dated 8 October 1992 responding to claims made by Mr Doohan concerning the sinking of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS>. The Minister had informed Mr Doohan that there was a limit to the amount of resources his Department could expend on this issue. He therefore advised Mr Doohan that unless irrefutable evidence was produced which disproved the accepted version of what happened to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney</EMPHASIS> he now considered the matter closed. In his facsimile Mr Doohan confirmed his `intended compliance' with the request for such evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) At this juncture there is no justification for an inquiry. As far as the Department of Defence and the Naval Historical Section is able to ascertain, no such evidence exists. Nor has Mr Doohan as yet provided relevant, verifiable evidence. The Minister for Defence in his correspondence to Mr Doohan of 8 October 1992 noted that defence historians believed there is insufficient  hard evidence to warrant the type of open-ended research Mr Doohan advocates. The Government has no objections to Mr Doohan pursuing his private investigations through the Australian Archives and other avenues, but believes his case would be best assessed by reputable historians and their academic peers in relevant fields.</PARA>
