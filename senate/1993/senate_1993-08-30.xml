<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer is of course not, and nor can that allegation be made against anyone in this government. The only claim that has ever been made in this chamber about the breaking of promises was in the context of Mr Keating's statement before the last election to maintain the tax to GDP ratios we roughly have at the moment&mdash;`in other words, I am promising not to put up tax'. That particular commitment was made squarely, as I have said a dozen times, in the context of maintaining tax to GDP ratios.

In May of this year I announced the establishment of an advisory committee to look at the problem of the lack of women's participation in certain science and engineering professions in Australia.

Today I am pleased to announce that Professor Ann Henderson-Sellers has agreed to chair this advisory committee. In the next few days I anticipate announcing the membership of the rest of the advisory committee which will, of course, include men as well as women. Professor Ann Henderson-Sellers presently is a research director and teacher at the Climatic Impact Centre, a member of the ASTEC, a member of the research reactor review, and a member of a number of international organisations. She has risen to the top of her profession and has a well-recognised standing in her profession within the science community in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the community understand that as a community we lose because many women do not continue with their careers. Overwhelmingly it is a cost to the community to train people to be scientists and engineers. When many of them complete only a few years in their careers before they leave to have families and so on, and never return, the community has lost its investment in their training. It is not just at the university level that there is a problem with the number of women enrolling; there is also very much a problem of ensuring that the structure of their profession enables them to have families and meet their family commitments without in any way suffering in their career progression.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, maybe I will be able to get across all of them. I understand that Mr Alan Oxley, in a paper given to a recent Fenner conference on trade and the environment, indicated to the audience that he could not comment on the Tuna-Dolphin case that is before the GATT for the reason that he had been selected to sit on the panel. I should record, therefore, that I think that is an entirely appropriate action for anyone adjudicating on such a case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The panel consists of a former Brazilian ambassador to the GATT, Mr George Maciel, Mr Winfried Lang, a former Austrian ambassador to the GATT, and Mr Alan Oxley, the former Australian ambassador to the GATT. There are several criteria for selecting panel members. The panels are composed of people who are well qualified, either from government or non-government organisations. They cannot be from contending countries in the procedure before the GATT; they have to be from third countries. Panel members are to serve in their individual capacities and not as government representatives, nor can they represent any organisation. The governments cannot give them instructions or seek to influence them as individuals on matters that are before the panel and, importantly, panel members should be selected with a view to ensuring that they are independent and of a sufficiently diverse background and have a wide spectrum of experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsibility for appointing panel members lies with the Director-General of the GATT, in consultation with the parties involved in the dispute. Often they all agree on who should be on the panel. In default of agreement, in consultation the director-general can appoint members to the panel. In doing so, he calls on people who he thinks have the appropriate skills for the case that is to be considered. I believe that Mr Oxley was included in this particular case by the director-general. He was not on any list that we put forward, nor did he go forward on the sponsorship of this government; he was selected by the director-general himself and for this particular case. Mr Oxley is a former Australian ambassador to the GATT. He is now a managing director of a private company&mdash;International Trade Strategies Pty Ltd. The Australian government has had no role in his selection.</PARA>

There is a very valid reason for wanting to reduce the lead levels in the air breathed by citizens of this country.

There is no doubt at all that reducing the use of leaded petrol will reduce the amount of lead that is available for Australian children and adults to breathe. It is now clear that the lead levels that can have a deleterious impact on children are actually judged to be lower than was previously thought.

In answer to a question from Senator Spindler in the last sitting week Senator Cook described the proposed US energy tax which sought to tax the energy content of goods and services, including imports, as `a non-tariff barrier to trade' and, by extension, not a legitimate environmental measure within the terms of GATT. Could the minister list the criteria which have been developed within the Uruguay Round by which these judgments can be made, that is, judgments which differentiate between non-tariff barriers to trade and environmental measures?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the question I answered was asked on 19 August. The answer I gave was that Australia did not oppose anything the Clinton administration was doing on energy taxes in the United States&mdash;the BTU tax, as it was called then. What we did make representations about was a proposal attached to it which came from the House of Representatives that there be the imposition of an imports tax on energy&mdash;on the energy content of imports. In any case, that was knocked out in the Senate and the BTU tax&mdash;the British thermal unit tax&mdash;was then dropped by the Clinton administration. It is essential to get that point clear. One would have to say that the proposed tax that the House of Representatives was considering was not, in the classic sense, a non-tariff barrier but it was particularly discriminatory against imports and for that reason we were concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

In other words, these have been the standard rules for the GATT almost since the GATT's inception. Lately there have been some discussions about border tax arrangements. It is not part of the Uruguay Round outcome; it is part of the general rules of the GATT.

The GATT comprehends those, but its concern is to see that trade is not distorted by the manipulation of standards of whatever sort; to provide non-tariff barriers to trade and thus distort free trade patterns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also increased the money for the alternative birthing program which is very much part of the national women's health program. It is another program that has been very well accepted by the community. Increasingly women as well as men are arguing as to why we need to have so much interference at the time of birth. The evidence is a matter of concern. I have certainly asked questions about this in the past. I am now very interested to note in this new role the concern out in the community about the number of times that childbirth is initiated or manipulated by the profession or that there is interference such as a caesarean section or an instruments delivery. More and more people are saying that they should be given the option of a natural as possible childbirth. This program allows women to have the support of a midwife at home if they so choose or to have the baby born in an alternative birthing room in hospitals. Funding for those alternative birthing services in large hospitals has been one very successful part of this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the election we also promised, for the first time ever, a longitudinal study for women's health. This is a very exciting initiative by government because for too long we have had women's health judged on the basis of data about men. That is an insufficient way of providing facts or building policy on women's health. Not too long ago, as I have said before, data on 350,000 men was measured and provided to women along the lines of `If women want to know if they are fit and healthy, this data has been adapted for them'. That is not sufficient. This government is addressing that by initiating this longitudinal study which for the first time will give us a much larger database of statistics and data on which we can then build policies for women into the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will capitulate to others on the history lesson from Senator Harradine, but his question really went to the substance of why measures have been taken in this budget. That is the matter on which he really wants me to provide an answer, I am sure, and that is the matter to which I will address myself. I assume, for the purpose of the answer, that he is correct with regard to Andrew Fisher.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with which the government found itself faced was that the exemption, as it previously existed, provided credit unions with an unfair competitive advantage when compared with the tax treatment of other financial institutions. These days, credit unions provide a range of services similar to those of other financial institutions and there is no justification for the tax exemption on the basis of the sorts of services provided. Building societies and other financial institutions are taxed and have to compete with credit unions. Effectively, the tax exemption provided credit unions with a cheap source of funds subsidised by the taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group asset growth for credit unions has been higher than for building societies and substantially higher than for banks. The credit union industry has high levels of compliance with the new prudential standards, including risk weighted capital requirements. There is no evidence to suggest that taxation would materially weaken the overall capacity of the industry to comply with its minimum capital requirements because, without going into all the details about how it might apply, by definition, only profitable credit unions will pay the tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure includes a significant adjustment period, especially for smaller credit unions, which goes to some of the concerns that Senator Harradine raised. While the credit union movement has played a very substantial and positive role in Australian history&mdash;and I would not, in any way, wish to question that, having been peripherally involved in it myself&mdash;I do not think it can any longer expect to build its financial strength on a tax exemption and a competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the inherent merits and virtues of many credit unions will indicate that they will go on from strength to strength, notwithstanding the tax change. The credit union movement will survive and thrive on its competitive merits, on the quality of its services and the special connections it can develop with its members&mdash;which credit unions have a capacity to do over and above many other financial institutions&mdash;rather than being a tax driven advantage which does not seem to be appropriate any longer.</PARA>

It had much more than merely symbolic significance in my view, because what we were seeing on that day was the most elaborately transformed manufacturing project in this country's history. I think it is important more than from just a defence point of view; it shows that this country, when it puts its mind to it, can get itself involved in the most sophisticated manufacturing projects around.

<PARA>I rise to express my great concern about the effect on jobs in the wine industry as a result of the government's decision to lift wine taxes by 55 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I took the opportunity to accompany Senator Troeth on a visit to central Victoria and to speak to some 12 winegrowers in that area. The message which came through to me&mdash;I am sure it has come through to the government and hopefully to government backbenchers who hold seats in winegrowing areas&mdash;was that this tax will have a very serious effect on jobs in rural Victoria and indeed in winegrowing areas throughout Australia. It will have a very serious effect on investment in the wine industry and no doubt will affect the investment potential in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make is that the government went to the election with a promise not to raise taxes. Throughout every electorate, particularly throughout every marginal electorate, Labor members of parliament ceaselessly repeated that promise. Nowhere was that clearer than in the seat of McEwen in Victoria, which has extensive winegrowing areas. That was a seat narrowly won by Mr Cleeland by some 300 votes. It was very clear from speaking to the winegrowers in that electorate that they were certainly under the impression, as indeed I am sure all members of the electorate were, that the Labor Party was not going to increase taxes, particularly taxes which savagely affect rural Victoria. The two key taxes that have been raised are the fuel tax and the wine tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the Senate's attention a comment that was made by Senator McMullan some years ago, before he entered this chamber. I think it raises an issue which I urge Labor backbenchers in winegrowing areas to remember. They had a mandate not to lift taxes. Senator McMullan, in speaking to a Fabian conference some years ago&mdash;I am glad he is in the chamber&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I can use an innocent example, because it occurs in a safe Conservative electorate,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this was some years ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if the Labor Party had won the electorate based on the Barossa Valley and we were introducing the wine tax, why would it be the end of the Labor Party if the member for the Barossa Valley crossed the floor, saying I'm going to vote against the wine tax. In the current circumstances it would be carried with a majority of 14 instead of 16. There wouldn't be any doubt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the important point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the local Labor Party members would support what that person did and I don't understand why the Party would rock on its foundations.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely the message which I believe Labor backbenchers in winegrowing areas must deal with because they have a very clear mandate to maintain the promises they made to their particular electorates. Those promises, as I said, were not to raise taxes and now we have the dilemma that these backbenchers are going to be asked to vote for the rises in taxes, particularly the fuel tax and the wine tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that Senator McMullan's piece of advice, given some years ago, is one that those Labor members of parliament should bear in mind. I put it to the Senate that this wine tax can be overturned if two or three Labor backbenchers in winegrowing areas stand up and say that they are not going to have a bar of this broken promise. One of those people is certainly Mr Cleeland in the Victorian seat of McEwen. Another would certainly be Mrs Silvia Smith in the seat of Bass which, as Senator Sherry will be able to tell us, has extensive winegrowing areas and which was won by 42 votes. Another is the marginal seat of Lyons where there are also extensive winegrowing interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I put it to you and I put it to Senator McMullan that this will affect jobs.

He waxed lyrical about the exponential growth&mdash;to use his words&mdash;that was going to happen in the wine industry. He tried to indicate to us that this tax would have no effect at all. Therefore, I was disappointed that Senator McMullan had not become better briefed in the last week. He obviously has not been out in the electorate listening to the winegrowers. He has not been listening to the people in the towns that support the wine industry. Let me assure him that, like Senator Kemp and Senator Troeth, I have been listening to people in the wine industry in the Hunter Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I had the honour of attending the Hunter Valley wine show, where the premium wines from this year's harvest were exhibited. We tasted the premium wines from last year's harvest. Australia has some of the best wines in the world, and this industry is about to be undercut by the measures of this government. The sort of thing that will happen is not exponential growth, as the minister indicated, but a great cut in growth. Projected exports have been revised downwards by the year 2000 from $1 billion to half a billion dollars. What both ministers seem to fail to understand is that to create a successful export industry we need a very strong and profitable domestic industry, and the domestic industry is now 75 per cent of the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind both ministers that three-quarters of the winegrowers in Australia are small businesses. Take any small business and increase its tax by 55 per cent, and what will be the effect? There will be a similar sort of effect on jobs as happened in 1986. I remind both ministers what happened in 1986 when the government last increased the wine tax. At that time we lost 1,000 jobs in the grape growing industry; we lost 1,000 jobs in the wineries. This time the initial projection is that we will lose at least 650 jobs in the wine industry, and that is only an initial projection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This tax is typical of the budget strategy as a whole&mdash;tax and spend. Taxes are raised in order that spending can be kept up without any attempt at reining in expenditure and having that expenditure in reasonable limits. For instance, we will raise out of this tax on wine $100 million. We will spend $170 million to build Gareth's gazebo; a nice new building for him and his apparatchiks to sit in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the wine industry has become an export industry. It is providing jobs and it is providing export earnings which we sorely need because of the profligate policies this government has run for 10 years that have racked up an international debt in excess of $200 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points that Senator McMullan was trying to make from the United States experience would be better couched in terms of the facts. We are indebted to Mr Brian Croser, the President of the Winemakers Federation of Australia&mdash;who was mentioned by Senator Kemp&mdash;because he points out that in California wine is taxed at the rate of 50c a litre, whereas Australian wine will now be taxed at the rate of $1.47 a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about having a competitive advantage, having the ability to compete against a foreign competitor, having micro-economic reforms in place and removing the impediments that make it possible for us to export, the result of this tax simply makes it more and more difficult for Australians to gain access to those foreign markets. There is also a lot of empirical evidence which has shown that in Australia when wine merchants are going around attempting to have orders placed for their product, people are simply saying, `No, we will not buy at this stage.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the important input of Senator Minchin's question was: what research had the government done to ascertain what the impact of this tax would be on the loss of jobs. In the first attempted answer Senator McMullan simply ducked and wove&mdash;refused to answer; just ignored it. In the supplementary question when Senator Minchin again pushed the point, what did we get, `I'm not going to tell you what research or advice we got.' In other words, how dare Senator Minchin ask the government, as the executive, to account to the parliament for the research that it did to bring out the budget that it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the fact that Mr Dawkins said the object of this budget was supposed to be jobs, I can only conclude from Senator McMullan's answer that he cares precious little about ordinary Australians whose jobs are placed in jeopardy. He believes that they are merely a statistic of revenue he has to raise in order to spend in accordance with the policies that it believes are more important than ordinary Australians. One million unemployed Australians to me is not just a statistic; it is one million Australians who are hurting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import of this question today was that the government by its callousness, its disregard, or simply by planning, is going to put out of jobs an additional 650 Australians, and kill off the opportunity of other young Australians to get a start in an industry which has growth potential and strength in terms of an export market. Where is the justice and the equity in a tax system that takes no heed of how it impacts on ordinary Australians? I will tell honourable senators the answer: there is none. This government is about collectives but not individuals. Individuals can always be sacrificed to the collective. Six hundred and fifty Australian jobs can be sacrificed so that whatever the number of people can be comfortably ensconced in Gareth's gazebo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Make the trade-offs. Make the decision. Let the Australian people make the decision. Does this government evidence at any point that it cares about the Australian people? No, it does not. This tax&mdash;and the government's failure to show the research it had done on the impact it would have on the Australian people&mdash;is just typical of this government and indicative of the fact that it cares not at all. It is downright un-Australian. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to note firstly that the wine tax increase is an increase on the wholesale price of wine. It is not an excise increase as in the case of beer and other alcoholic  beverages. Therefore the tax situation in the wine industry is still significantly different from that applying to beer and other forms of alcohol. It is not an excise tax. Those opposite refer to a 55 per cent increase in tax; that is not the effect on the retail price. It is not a 55 per cent increase in the retail price as they attempt to make out. It is a 55 per cent increase on the wholesale side. That does not equate to a 55 per cent increase in the retail price. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take a few moments to support my colleagues. I think it is important that we look at this from the point of view of Tasmania, which is where Senator Sherry comes from. Senator Sherry mentioned that the price of a bottle of wine will increase by at least a dollar, but he has conveniently forgotten the freight component. The government's tax increases on fuel alone are what the winegrowers in Tasmania are most concerned about. They will increase the price of everything&mdash;bottles, corks, the whole shooting match.

While he was down there, Mr Keating took the opportunity to boast about his piggery industry, which he conveniently forgot to declare in his tax return some time ago. Here he was encouraging primary production in Tasmania at the same time as the government is cutting the Tasmanian wine industry off at the knees. Unlike New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, which are the established winegrowing areas, the winegrowing industry in Tasmania is a fledgling industry.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table two opinions that I have just obtained which will be relevant to honourable senators' consideration of the notice of motion that I have just given. The first is a joint opinion from Mr Anthony J.H. Morris QC and Mr Liam F. Kelly of the Queensland bar. I will read simply the conclusions of their opinion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the reasons . . . in this Opinion, we have reached the following conclusions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 will, if enacted, constitute a law "imposing taxation", and there is no substance in the argument that the Bill (if enacted) will not impose taxation, but merely increase the rates of taxation eligible under existing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)The Bill (if enacted) will not "deal with one subject of taxation only", and again there is no substance in the argument that the requirements of the second paragraph of Section 55 are satisfied because the effect of the Bill (if enacted) will be to amend a number of principal Acts, each of which deals with one subject of taxation only; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)For those reasons, if the Bill is enacted in its present form, it will be invalid.</PARA>
<PARA>I will read one more paragraph. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important, in our view, to emphasise the consequences of invalidity. If the Bill is struck-down by the High Court of Australia by reason of non-compliance with Section 55 of The Constitution, that will have the effect that all of its provisions cease to be operative. The invalidity of the Bill will not only affect those of its provisions which seek to impose a higher burden upon taxpayers; it will also result in the striking-down of those provision which are intended to reduce the burden on taxpayers, or to confer other benefits or concessions upon taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the opinion of Mr Morris QC unambiguously is that if the Senate passes this bill and if it is passed in the other place and becomes law, it will be attacked in the High Court of Australia and will fall, with the disastrous consequences presumably that some time next year all of the provisions contained in that bill will cease to be operative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the objection because I think that sort of offensive comment should be on the record. Rather than facing up to its responsibilities, all we get from this government is abuse and more abuse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second opinion is from the highly regarded constitutional expert Professor Colin Howard. Again I mention only a few paragraphs of his opinion because obviously it has to be studied carefully. In paragraph 11 of his opinion, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I conclude therefore that wherever the Bill increases a tax rate, which it does in clauses 12, 70, 71, 72, and 85, it seeks to impose taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>The next question he asks is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the Bill deal with other matters?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>The next question he asks is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is rendered ineffective?</PARA>
<PARA>I will simply move to the last part of his advice, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if in the present case the tax increases were held to be impositions of taxation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which he believes they will be&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">both the increases themselves and ancillary provisions necessarily dependent on them would simply be invalidated without consequential effects on the principal Acts.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this act would fall as a whole. This is worth noting, and perhaps Senator Schacht might even been interested in this. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This may well cause the government to reconsider the whole Bill, for as a matter of policy the provisions that in one way or another reduce taxation are no doubt dependent in a different sense on the tax increases.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I table that opinion also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In giving this notice today, I seek that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs address this very serious issue because, on the basis of the opinions that I have tabled, the government is asking us to enact legislation that is not only potentially invalid but also, according to these learned gentlemen, likely to be found invalid with the dire consequences that would flow from that. It seems to me that not only should the Senate be persuaded by that to certainly take the reference to its committee for further consideration, but that the government should also take away these opinions, study them carefully and act appropriately as a result of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand, from speaking to Senator Spindler, who I think has been delegated responsibility on behalf of the Australian Democrats, that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the motion in the terms that I have put. Senator Coulter nods his head, so I think that is further confirmation. Therefore, the Senate will take this reference and no doubt will take more learned advice. But what the government has sought to impose not only on the processes of the parliament but also on the people of Australia is extremely worrying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one more minute, Mr President, I will tell you what the government has done because it is worth understanding. The proper course of action was to bring each of these impositions of tax separately to the parliament. But in an unprecedented way the government linked together the impositions of tax with the other so-called benefits that it was giving by virtue of the budget, for the one purpose of making it difficult for this parliament to object to and vote down the tax increases. But in doing that the government was too smart by half because it would appear that it has run foul of section 55 of the constitution and put at risk the whole of the package that is contained within that Taxation Deficit Reduction Bill with all the consequences that would flow from it. That is what the government has sought to do. It ought to be condemned for that. I trust that the Senate will take this reference.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for you letter of 7 April 1993 requesting advice about the reasons for amending the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) regulations and the Wool Research and Development Corporation (WRDC) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adoption of a simple majority for motions relating to wool tax recommendations was a measure designed to improve the accountability of industry bodies to their constituents, and was made against the background of public concern and comment on the operations of the Annual General Meetings of the AWC and WRDC. You might also note that this approach accords with a Cabinet decision made in relation to the voting arrangements for annual general meetings of statutory marketing authorities. In addition, apart from the requirement that no confidence motions be passed by a two-thirds majority, I considered a simple majority to be the most democratic arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Regulations reflect similar changes to legislation covering other relevant rural sector bodies, and ensure that a consistent approach is adopted in relation to the legislation for which I have portfolio responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have noted your comments regarding the minor omissions in both sets of Regulations. I have requested that they be rectified when the Regulations are next amended.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Public Service Determination 1992/333, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 20 May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determination provides for the payment of a disability allowance for officers of the Industry Commission who are required to relocate from Canberra to Melbourne. Clause 3.1(2) appears to confer a discretion on the Chairman of the Commission to increase or decrease the amount of these allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned about the nature of this discretion. In particular, it questions whether it is appropriate to confer an apparent power to reduce allowances. On its face, this appears to be a surprising power. The Committee appreciates that persons who disagree with the exercise of the discretion may approach the Merit Protection and Review Agency. However, the Committee questions any need at all for a discretion to reduce allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is also concerned at the apparent possibility of prejudicial retrospective exercise of the discretion, as the determination was made on 23 December 1992 to apply to a disability which commenced on 1 August 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 24 May 1993 concerning Public Service Determination No. 333 of 1992. The delay in responding is regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Committee is concerned that, under clause 3.1(2) of that Determination, the Chairman of the Industry Commission is empowered to direct that an amount be paid in lieu of the disability allowance provided for in clause 3.1(1) and that the amount so paid could be more than or less than the amount specified in clause 3.1(1)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note that, on 27 May 1993, you gave notice in the Senate that, after 15 sitting days, you would move that Determination No. 333 be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Committee's particular concerns are that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Chairperson has a power to reduce allowances; there could be a prejudicial retrospective exercise of the discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to draw the Committee's attention to certain points:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the allowance under clause 3.1 is additional to the normal transfer allowance provided for in Public Service Determinations No. 10 of 1983 and No. 46 of 1984;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">this provision was in recognition of the fact that officers could be asked to relocate at short notice and was intended to provide for reasonably incurred additional transfer costs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">it was considered that some flexibility should be provided to allow for either an increase or decrease in the additional allowance to cater for particular cases in which the additional allowance was either excessive or insufficient;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Chairperson has, however, not had to exercise the power to reduce the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances, it has been decided that the Determination will be amended to delete the power under clause 3.1(2) to reduce the allowance.</PARA>

<PARA>Those are strong words: irreparable damage to all Australians; irreparable damage to the integrity of our democratic parliamentary process; the Keating government's deceitful litany of broken promises; the Keating government's budget of betrayal. The coalition makes no apology for the strength of this motion; we make no apology for calling it urgent because the broken promises of this government are a deceitful litany. The betrayal of all Australians in the budget is a matter of the gravest concern. No government should govern on a program of broken promises, betrayal or deceit, yet that is precisely what this government has done and precisely what it continues to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government won the 13 March election on the back of a huge range of promises. Many of these promises have since been wantonly and deliberately broken. Indeed, it is now crystal clear&mdash;it was clear to many of us before the election&mdash;that the government never had any intention of keeping these promises. They were the wild, irresponsible promises of a desperate government and a desperate Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who was prepared to stoop to any depths to retain power so that he could enjoy the perks of office and could thumb his nose at the rest of Australia with grotesque demands such as ordering a $24,000 foreign made Thai teak table for the Lodge, insulting Australian craftsmen and designers and Australians generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the election the government has shed itself of its promises as if they were, to quote Niki Savva of the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun, </EMPHASIS>`disposable nappies'. That was before the recent budget. That budget has upped the litany of broken promises stakes still further. Indeed, the list of promises&mdash;broken, bent, twisted or rewritten&mdash;comes close to rivalling the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> for numbers of entries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline first some of the Keating government's pre-election promises and their fate. The Prime Minister promised&mdash;it was in the policy document released at his election campaign launch&mdash;that all age pensioners would be removed from the tax system by 1995. Five days after the election, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said that it was as a result of a printing mistake that this promise had been made and that he had no plans at all to honour it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said that it would extend Medicare by buying 10,000 private hospital beds. Instead, the government has now said it will spend the money in other ways. Far from extending Medicare, the government has commenced dismantling it. The first major step is its decision to remove optometry testing from Medicare coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promised to introduce free dental treatment for low income earners from 1 July 1993. The introduction has now been deferred for 12 months. One would not want to bet one's shirt on that start date being honoured either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promised a $30 a week home child-care allowance to women to replace the dependent spouse rebate. The clear indication at the time was that that would be introduced this financial year. Only now are we told that the start date will not be before part way through the next financial year; that is, 1994-95. A similar situation applies with the promise to provide a cash rebate of up to $30 a week on child-care fees for all women who work, train or study, or are looking for work. It is almost certain, too, that that promise will be doubly broken through its being means tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government promised to match, dollar for dollar, the amount raised by charities. In a mean, churlish, petty and underhand decision the government broke this promise by matching only the money spent by charities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These examples are but the tip of the iceberg of broken promises. Time does not permit me to enlarge on all the remainder, but the daddy of them all is the Prime Minister's promises on personal income tax cuts. In his One Nation statement in February 1992, the Prime Minister promised to cut personal income tax by around $8 1/2 billion in two stages&mdash;the first, and about one-third of that $8.5 billion, on 1 July 1994 and the second, and by far the larger, on 1 January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his, I would describe it as infamous, interview on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program in November 1992, just as the election cycle was really hotting up, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I'm promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Mr Keating implied quite unequivocally that the personal tax cuts promised in One Nation would not be paid for by any increase in other taxes. So intent was the Prime Minister on deceiving the electorate before the election that he actually legislated the two-stage tax cuts&mdash;for 1 July and 1 January 1996&mdash;in late 1992. At the Prime Minister's luncheon appearance at the National Press Club just two days before the 13 March election, a questioner had the temerity to ask him whether there was any prospect of these tax cut promises not being honoured. The Prime Minister flew at the impudent journalist and, with savage sarcasm, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me tell you something, I thought you might have known&mdash;they've been legislated. They are not promises, they are law&mdash;L.A.W., law.</PARA>
<PARA>It has only now been revealed&mdash;in late July, by none other than the Prime Minister and Mr Dawkins themselves in an admission of what can be called nothing less than perfidy&mdash;that just five days after the election they discussed ways in which they could best break the tax cut promise with the least political damage. Indeed, the Treasurer admitted in the House of Representatives the very day after the recent budget that Labor knew before the election that it could not deliver on its election promises to introduce tax cuts, not raise other taxes and not increase the overall burden of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all that, as late as 4 July this year on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program the Treasurer said that the tax cuts were `set in concrete'. On 22 July, just 18 days later, the Prime Minister announced that the legislated&mdash;l-a-w, law&mdash;personal tax cuts would&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;be relegislated. The unequivocal promise had been broken and, instead, the bulk of the tax cuts would be deferred from 1 January 1996 to a later date, `probably 1998'. The Treasurer confirmed that in his budget speech. We all know what `probably 1998' means. It means never. Those tax cuts were never going to be delivered. The government knew they were never going to be delivered and yet it allowed the Australian people to go to the election on the basis of a promise that they would be delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has revealed another act of perfidy by the government, another smashed promise, another lie. The government told the electorate before the election that it would not increase taxes. No less a person than the Prime Minister himself said so. He said, `What I'm promising is not to put up tax'. What is the reality? The reality is a savage increase in taxes across the board. Sales tax is going up by between 10 per cent and 20 per cent. The tax on wine is going up by 55 per cent. The tax on petrol is going up by up to 10c a litre&mdash;or at least it was until today; I will come back to that later. There will be a huge and retrospective increase in the tax on accumulated annual and long service leave and increases in a whole raft of other taxes and charges. Incredibly&mdash;indeed, criminally&mdash;low income earners receive virtually no compensation for these savage tax hikes that will, on the government's own figures, treble the consumer price index increase in the next year. There is a sop to the low income earners&mdash;a lousy, measly, insulting $1.92 a week tax rebate for persons earning less than $23,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the government had to put up taxes. The Treasurer had said that the basic commitment of the government in terms of the election was to get the budget deficit down to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. He said, though, that that was all going to happen quite easily&mdash;the budget was going to whirr back into balance; no doubt about that. Anyone with half a brain and half an understanding of the economic process and the finances of government would have known and did know that that was simply not true. As a result, since the election huge tax increases have been built into our fiscal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the government's figures, in the next three years of 1994, 1995 and 1996, the real increase in the total tax take in Australia&mdash;by real, I mean after we account for inflation&mdash;will be 8.1 per cent in the first year, 6 per cent in the second year and 5 per cent in the third year. The government was not prepared to give those figures in the budget. It required action by the Liberal and National parties in the Senate the week before last to force those figures out of the government. No wonder it sat on them, because they show massive hikes in the real tax take over the next few years and a progressive increase in the proportion of tax to our total national income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In absolute terms, the amount of tax to be collected, on the government's own figures&mdash;if we believe these figures&mdash;between the year just concluded, when the tax take was $92.4 billion, and the following four years, concluding with 1996-97, will rise progressively each year to $121.4 billion. They are staggering tax increases whichever way we wish to look at them, yet the government went to the election promising that there would be no tax increases. No wonder there has been such an enormous outcry over the budget from all sections of the community, particularly from lower income earners, Labor's own so-called natural constituency&mdash;the so-called true believers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget hits the low income earners very hard. The gap between rich and poor will inevitably increase still further. That gap has already widened dangerously over Labor's decade in office. This is a mean budget; it is a cruel budget; it is a budget that creates not one more job; it is a budget that is divisive&mdash;it divides Australian from Australian&mdash;and it is a denial of the very Australian concept of a fair go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of Michael Easson's comments, Senator Short got it wrong. In terms of the quote `act of bastardry', Michael Easson was referring to the alleged retrospective tax on untaken annual leave and long service leave. He was not referring to the budget in general.

I understand that Senator Short has to leave the chamber. I understand the time constraints. I will not abuse him for leaving while I am talking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three themes that I wish to take up: firstly, the strategy and integrity behind this budget; secondly, the continuing criticism that we get from the opposition about the statements of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that there should be no negotiations in this place; and, thirdly, some&mdash;it would take too long to go through them all&mdash;of the specific promises in this budget  that we have kept. Let us deal with some of the positive rather than some of the negative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first theme that I will address is the integrity of this budget, which was well out-lined in the budget speech by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins. Our intent over the next four years is to reduce the budget deficit to less than one per cent of gross domestic product; in other words, approximately $6 billion. Why is this our approach? We wish to ensure that we can reduce the budget deficit to reasonable levels so that the government is not borrowing too much and not depriving the private sector of the necessary funds to borrow in order to expand and invest. That is one of the central elements in the strategy of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second central economic element is that, if we maintain a significant budget deficit over and above our aim of one per cent of gross domestic product, there is no doubt that interest rates will rise significantly. These are two of the important macro-economic objectives of this budget. We are setting down a four-year strategy for reducing the budget deficit to one per cent of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note what is happening overseas. Whilst, at times, looking overseas can be a little too fashionable, the facts are that the United States&mdash;despite all the heartburn it has gone through in constructing its budget under the new president, President Clinton&mdash;will still have, in 1997, a budget deficit of three per cent of gross domestic product. Canada will only get its budget deficit down to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product&mdash;that is, of course, if there is not a change of government with the election that is expected shortly. Germany will get its deficit down to only four per cent of gross domestic product. Even in the United Kingdom&mdash;the doyenne of conservatism that is continually quoted by those opposite&mdash;the public sector borrowing requirements will be seven per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of deficits are unsustainable in the long term. This government has taken a brave and courageous approach to addressing the budget deficit four years out and doing something about it. It is in that context that the budget strategy has been developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we intend to address the budget deficit? There will be a mixture of expenditure restraints and a mixture of tax increases. Those tax increases include&mdash;and we do not shy away from these measures&mdash;a revision of the income tax system. It will be tightened to ensure that the income tax system is applied in a more equitable way. That measure will raise over $600 million. There will be an increase in the rates of excise on petroleum products and tobacco. Aside from the obvious revenue implications in that measure, the secondary goal&mdash;and I think very important goal that has been scoffed at by some people&mdash;in the petroleum area is to ensure that we phase out leaded petrol. I am not going to speak in detail about that today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at the lead in petrol conference representing the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee). There are important reasons why we are going to establish a differential on petrol. The issue that has not been mentioned in this debate very often is that if we do not have a petrol differential to encourage the phase out of leaded petrol it becomes very difficult for the oil refineries to change over from leaded to unleaded petrol. </PARA>

It cannot just switch over from leaded to unleaded fuel overnight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are about halfway through that conversion and regrettably the conversion has slowed down. That is why we are adopting a price differential on petrol. That price differential will mean that the original target date of 2002 will not be advanced. It will make sure that the original date of 2002 will be maintained by the overwhelming majority of the car fleet being converted. If we do not adopt the price differential, it will mean that we will have to import the unleaded products at a cost of about $270 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the other revenue increases that will achieve our objective of reducing the budget deficit, there will be an increase in sales tax in two stages over the next two years and there will be an increase in the sales tax on wine, which I commented on earlier in another debate. We do not shy away from having to make those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been made about the comments of the Prime Minister and Treasurer prior to the election. Those comments should be seen in the context of Australia being a low tax country. I recall that Senator Short in a speech in this place last year acknowledged that Australia was a low tax country by comparison with other OECD countries. It is interesting to note that in 1982-83 when we came into office the taxation revenue, as a percentage of gross domestic product, was 24 per cent.

Generally tax levels in this country have decreased&mdash;they have decreased, not increased. I do not hold to the notion that we need to continually reduce the overall tax burden; I frankly do not think that is possible. We have to pay for the provision of government goods and services, and that has to be paid by taxation revenue. It was in that context that the commitment was made by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first theme was the integrity of the budget and the issue that I want to refer to now is what will be done with the revenue that is being raised from the tax increases in the budget. Not one cent of that revenue is going to increased expenditure. In a responsible approach prior to the election this government committed itself to funding its specific promises&mdash;many of which I will be referring to shortly, if I get the time&mdash;through savings in the budget structure. All of the revenue increases that the government is predicting from the tax changes will go to reducing the budget deficit. That is a highly responsible approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite go out into the community and say, `Well we don't want this tax and we don't want that tax', I challenge them to say how they would balance the budget. The opposition has retreated from its promise prior to the election&mdash;and I understand why, given the political problems it encountered with that policy&mdash;and it is now saying that there will be no goods and services tax. What is the opposition going to come up with in order to balance the budget?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a curious twist of history that the 1993 budget is an indirect consequence of the launch of Fightback in October 1991. First of all we have the coalition's unblushing claim in Fightback that everybody would be better off. That was open to question. Then we had a rudderless government. Mr Hawke was paralysed by the problems of the leadership struggle. His flat-footed response became his swan song as Prime Minister. We then had a new Prime Minister (Mr Keating), anxious to regain the initiative, crafting the now famous and discredited One Nation statement, which also promised all gain and no pain&mdash;income tax cuts without a GST.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fightback and One Nation were cannons with a mission to destroy each other. But, instead, they both self-destructed&mdash;one under the weight of fanciful and now discredited growth predictions and the other because absolutely no amount of hard sell could disguise its fundamental inequities. Out of the ashes of Fightback I came a kinder and gentler Fightback II. Then we saw an increasingly desperate Labor Party showering promises on the Australian people as a sort of last hurrah, only to find itself stuck with having to implement them or to justify breaking them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to this pathetic and inequitable budget&mdash;a failed attempt to turn a pastiche of ill-conceived and unrelated promises into a cohesive economic statement. The document has come unstuck because the cumulative effect of wild promises and macho grandstanding is that the government has backed itself into a corner. The Keating government has to take the rap for its own mistakes. Having said that, it is quite clear that this budget is a product of one of the more bitter gladiatorial contests in Australian political history. The Keating and Hewson war has always threatened to claim struggling Australians as collateral damage no matter who won the 13 March poll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real rot in this budget set in when the Prime Minister decided that income tax cuts were a political imperative above all others and set about passing them into law with the support of the opposition. This urgency motion talks about `irreparable damage . . . to the integrity of our democratic parliamentary process'. That damage began when the One Nation tax cuts became l-a-w law. Labor confronted this chamber with an unprecedented and unprincipled attempt to tie the hands of an incoming government&mdash;which it did not expect to be itself&mdash;to the tune of $8 billion of unaffordable and inequitable expenditure, and the coalition voted for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government has tied itself in knots to produce this horror budget, it has completely failed to look beyond the bottom fiscal line at the real economic and social needs of this country. Yes, it is a budget of betrayal. It imposes petrol prices without adequate compensation to those who can least afford to pay. It delivers large tax cuts to higher income earners at the expense of those at the bottom of the pile. It imposes retrospective tax on the accrued leave benefits which form a legitimate part of the financial plans of impending retirees. It undermines Medicare&mdash;one of the primary issues on which this government was re-elected&mdash;by terminating benefits for optometry services. It takes yet another swipe at students in a way which will hit the most disadvantaged the hardest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is too early to conclude that the damage to the Australian people is irreparable because it is within the power of this government to make it fairer. But it remains to be seen whether this will be done. There is no doubt that the document as it stands is highly regressive. It hits and hurts the true believes who voted this government back into office because they feared the alternative, only to find a wolf inside the other wolf's clothing. In short, it is grossly unfair and utterly cynical. But fairness is not the only vital ingredient which is missing from this budget. In fact, the Democrats would argue that there are other gaping holes which deserve as much attention, if not more. The fundamental failure of this budget is that it does almost nothing about jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the budget was being drafted the government flirted briefly with the idea of a jobs levy&mdash;a small tax surcharge to fund new job schemes for the long-term unemployed. But whenever the government went to make any decision, tax cuts worth $8 billion got in the way. The government could not deliver income tax cuts with one hand and then take some of them back with the other, so it did nothing. It was too bad for the jobless; they would have to wait for the rest of the world to catch up, as I was trying to tell Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been nearly six months since the election. There is still no sign that the government has finally woken up to a fact which is taken for granted by the world's successful economies: if a country wants substantial and lasting industry development, governments must guide that development with sector by sector planning and assistance. The increase in the sales tax on wine is a classic illustration of this failure of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be a case for increasing the tax rate on wine to bring it more into line with other alcoholic beverages such as beer, but not at the expense of the viability of an increasingly export oriented industry. I would be very interested to find out whether the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) had any input into this decision, and whether he asked his department to assess what this would do to industry viability and the economic health of wine producing regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petrol prices are another case in point. The only measure to reduce lead in the atmosphere that the government is proposing is the blunt instrument of price hikes. Meanwhile, a golden opportunity to seed the development of a renewable fuel industry producing a blend of petrol and ethanol has been completely overlooked, even though it could phase out the need for lead in petrol within a few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is perhaps the greatest betrayal. The government has betrayed millions of Australians who see unemployment, the trade deficit and green economic development as top priorities which have not been addressed in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the statement in this motion which deplores the damage done to our democratic parliamentary processes. No-one in this chamber will be in any doubt that many Australians see this budget as a deceitful and dishonest document. It has undermined still further the credibility of promises made by any politician during an election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the election, the Democrats see faults on all sides. No matter how up-front and honest the coalition claims itself to be, and no matter how much the government blusters in its defence of this budget, the fact is that both parties did try to lie and misrepresent their way into office. One side claimed we were heading for a double-dip recession&mdash;remember it?&mdash;the other looked forward to a diminished trade deficit and no threat of new taxes. Rubbery figures bounced all around the political landscape. Nobody knew whom to believe&mdash;let alone the voters who were trying to make a choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are at the no negotiation stage of the argument in this debate in the chamber tonight. I think this whole notion of no negotiation&mdash;and Senator Sherry's support of it as a legitimate part of a negotiation process&mdash;where you start off saying no, raises the `when the Prime Minister says no does he really mean yes' debate to a new high. </PARA>

The government has taken this abuse of the democratic process to a new high in the past week with its deliberate and orchestrated attempt to spook the markets and scare the Senate into passing the budget unchanged. The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) claimed that the budget deficit target was under threat by the Democrats, despite a press release and newspaper article which specifically said that we would respect the deficit reduction strategy of the government, but by redesigning key budget measures in an essentially revenue neutral way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was immediately obvious that the government was trying to use the markets to undermine the Senate's legitimate role as a house of review.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the shenanigans do not end there. We are also faced with the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, which is designed to force the Senate to deal with the package on a take it or leave it basis. We have had the government attempt to say that the budget is non-negotiable, only to be forced into an embarrassing backdown because of the self-evident reality that it does not control this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now up to the Senate to repair some of the damage which this motion deplores. The Democrats believe that it is beyond our mandate to totally overturn this budget or to undermine its deficit targets, but we are well within our rights to make it fairer or at the least to make it much less unfair. It is also up to the Senate to restore some integrity to the democratic parliamentary process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Short's urgency motion, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The irreparable damage caused to all Australians, and to the integrity of our democratic parliamentary process, by the Keating Government's deceitful litany of broken promises and its 1993 Budget of betrayal.</PARA>
<PARA>Having listened to Senator Sherry a little while ago, I wonder whether he has really listened to what the people are saying and crying out about, to what most of the commentators have been saying and to what most of the papers have been saying over the last week or so; that is, that this budget which has just been brought down by Mr Dawkins is a litany of broken promises. Probably never in the history of Australia has a Prime Minister so mishandled the truth and so callously and arrogantly misled and deceived the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) went to an election with no formula for economic recovery and no plan for the future of the country. He went to the polls intent only on one thing: absolutely distorting the truth about the coalition's policies and pork-barrelling to such an extent that he all but promised the sun, the moon, the stars and everything else that goes with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether he really expected to win the election. In fact, I do not think he did, and he made all the promises in the world. He had no intention, if he won the election, of delivering any of those promises. He just worked on the old people in the community. He used the `you can fool some of the people some of the time' routine. He slipped into the vaudeville of trying to fool people by great charades, which he does so often and so well. Call it what you will, it all adds up to the same thing: the Prime Minister is laughing all the way to the Lodge at the expense of the Australian elector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said on election night&mdash;do all honourable senators remember very clearly? I suppose I do because I was a bit disappointed on that night&mdash;`This is one for the true believers'. How he and Mr Dawkins have deserted them! He should have said, `This is one for the suckers, and I sucked you all in yet again'. But even the true believers are realising just how arrogant and cold this Prime Minister is. Even the trade union movement turned on him after he delivered his clanger of a budget. Mr Martin Ferguson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wouldn't want to be a worker who drives a leaded vehicle or smokes or drinks because, frankly, they wouldn't be sitting at home in front of the television thinking about voting for John Dawkins in a double dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have come a long way in 10 years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, we have come a long way with wholesale taxes which have trebled; the tax take has trebled from this government in the last 10 years. And he continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . why risk throwing it away and embracing a policy mix that will reduce the standard of living and increase inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what this budget will do. It broke so many promises that if we stayed here all night we would not adequately cover them all. Senator Sherry says, `There's a few we didn't break and I'd like to quote them again'&mdash;which he did not quote today but he would have liked to have done so. There are a few that the government has not broken but it has broken a lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to contain my remarks just to the rural sector because it has been slugged the hardest. People in that sector are among those who are least able to afford what has happened in the budget for a number of reasons. They fall into the under $20,700 net income&mdash;indeed, many people in rural areas have no income at all and even have negative or negative negative incomes. The wine industry is a rural industry and it has been slugged by a massive 55 per cent increase in excise. Country people are heavy users of fuel, particularly leaded fuel. All the research into leaded fuel has been carried out in areas where a lot of leaded fuel is used in close proximity&mdash;for example, in the western suburbs of Sydney. Country towns have high levels of unemployment but no new initiatives were provided for regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the policy speech delivered in February of this year we have to remind ourselves that the Prime Minister said that he recognised the significant role played by rural Australia. To reward them for this significant contribution, what did he do?  He offered to extend the JJJ network to all parts of Australia with populations over 20,000. I fail to see how this could be classed as any sort of inducement for rural Australia. Given how little Mr Keating knows about it, one perhaps has to forgive him for thinking that bankrupt and drought stricken farmers would get a real buzz out of listening to heavy-metal music. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what else the Prime Minister has done for rural Australia. Perhaps the greatest attack on people in rural areas is, as I said earlier, the increase in fuel prices and the proposed extra hike for users of leaded petrol. This government has treated users of leaded petrol as environmental bandits when in reality it is those people unable to afford newer cars who are forced to use leaded petrol. A survey in last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> showed clearly that people living in places like Campbelltown, Blacktown and Liverpool use more leaded than unleaded fuel; while people living in Woollahra, Kuringai and Lane Cove use more unleaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel is the lifeblood of rural Australia. Those of us who live in the bush use it every day to live, to work and to earn our income. Apart from rural families, most rural services use leaded or diesel fuel. Country fire services use either leaded or diesel fuel and these increases will add thousands to their annual operating costs. The transport industry is another that is struggling. It too will be hard-hit by these increases. It will have to put up its charges and again rural people will be the losers as far as getting their products onto and off their farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diesel fuel rebate is about the one remaining assistance offered to rural Australians. The government has often claimed that it will not remove it. Technically, it has not done so, but a new administration charge is to apply to cover the cost of public servants processing the claim forms. It is estimated that fuel taxes now cost the agricultural, transport and value adding industries in Australia $1.3 billion. Obviously that figure will increase. It costs the government some $6 million to administer the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It is estimated that the one per cent administration charge will bring in an extra $10 million altogether, which means basically a tax on top of the charge for administration. By any standard it is just another new tax, a new twist to the user pays: the user pays with the government getting that cop on the top. The other day in the Senate I said that when the user pays system is working, if the government wants the producers to pay money for administration, maybe we should be charging the government for the cost of coping with all the forms that we in the rural communities are required to fill out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool tax is another unbelievable attack on rural Australia at a time when the wool industry is barely struggling to stay on its feet. The wool tax is going up from 8.5 per cent to 12 per cent. Today, for those who are interested in the wool market, the indicator is at about 417c, which is down 17c on last week. It shows that wool is selling below the cost of production. Yet another $68 million will be taken out of the pockets of an industry that is in desperate straits at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sales tax for local councils will also have a big impact on country councils. They will be faced with the choice of cutting services or increasing rates. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this budget establishes an economic framework over four years&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Sherry remarked on that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a framework for continuing low interest rates and continuing low inflation, which, combined with reduced company tax and generous investment incentives, will support increased business investment for future growth in production and employment.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot see it happening either now or further down the track because this budget has knocked the guts out of everyone in the country areas. Yet having said that, the increase in fuel will be inflationary and the fuel increase could raise the CPI by as much as 1.7 per cent. The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other commitments include action to enrich the culture of our country, protect its environment, and support those living outside the major cities.</PARA>
<PARA>I would say something, if I could in this place, that is attached to the cowyard and is on the ground most of the time. But instead of assistance, there are positive disincentives, fuel being just one. On wine, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wine is currently more lightly taxed than beer and spirits. From tonight, tax on wine will apply at the 31 per cent rate. But the government is committed to retaining the exclusion of wine from excise.</PARA>
<PARA>So we did not have an increase in excise, but excise is just another name for tax. We had a massive rise in the wholesale sales tax on an industry that has really started to perform in recent years. We have already heard today about the massive loss of jobs likely to result in the wine industry. We have also heard the cynical response by Senator McMullan, as I am sure every winegrower heard today in question time. It is estimated at least 650 jobs will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine exports to the UK now account for some five per cent of wine consumption in that country. It is becoming a vital export for this country but, like all exports, it is being taxed out of existence. The increase will add in direct costs to the Australian wine industry about $100 million; in domestic sales about $445 million in potential vineyard and winery investments; and $126 million in potential export growth. That is not helping that industry much either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another promise from the government has been broken. While the government claims that it will protect export industries, it taxes them to damnation and extinction. Indeed, sales tax and customs and excise will bring in the staggering figure of $22,260 million this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a budget that will get Australia back on its feet. A litany of promises, some implied, have been given to rural Australia with nothing delivered. The budget is a pea and thimble trick from one end to another. The original Artful Dodger would be proud that his modern day namesake is carrying on the family tradition so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has claimed that it has increased spending on the rural adjustment scheme when it has passed the buck to the state governments&mdash;$104 million coming from the states and only $53 million from the Commonwealth. Mr Dawkins tells us in his papers that spending on the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service will be reduced by $20 million over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told that streamlining and efficiencies have brought about this reduction to the service for which farmers have to pay. Yet when one examines the budget papers, one sees that spending last year was $171 million and by 1996-97 spending will be $166 million. This is $5 million over four years, not the $20 million promised. In order to get the $20 million, the government threw in a few one-offs for this year to inflate the figure&mdash;another deception and another fraud on the Australian people. As I said, the Quarantine Inspection Service is a very contentious issue for rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a budget that has been brought to the parliament which we will be looking at very closely and voting on in the next week or so.

<PARA>The real issue is that this motion is factually incorrect. Many Australians have benefited directly from the billions of dollars of government expenditure. The budget with its $16 billion deficit will provide a stimulus to the economy, while at the same time, in the longer term, the government is addressing the question of debt. As Australia works towards being a more effective player on the international markets, the Labor government is moving towards its objective of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By international comparisons Australia's deficit is small. Canada's deficit, for instance, is larger than Australia's, as is Germany's. In fact, the case might be adequately made for an expansion of the Australian deficit, not its further contraction as is argued by the Liberal Party. Therein lies the absolute hypocrisy of the motion before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party's policy is to cut government spending, as we have heard from Senator Bishop this afternoon on the question of wine. Its approach is to cut $10 billion out of the budget. As Senator Sherry pointed out, we have not heard exactly how it plans to do that. The budget delivers real gains to many millions of Australians&mdash;in education, health, transport, social security, arts, culture and child care. The list is quite extensive. At the same time the government is developing an economic strategy to strengthen our fundamental economic foundations&mdash;greater trade with Asia, improved export performances, lower inflation, long term interest rates, which are now at a 20-year low, and productivity growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also providing for increased social reform and equity with improved social security benefits for families and children; the seniors card for low income pensioners; improvements in newstart allowances; Commonwealth dental programs for low income earners; and improvement in women's health programs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion before us refers to the integrity of our democratic processes. I am very surprised that the opposition has the nerve to raise this point, given its behaviour in this chamber. Over three weeks ago, on 19 August, we saw rammed through this chamber proposals to restrict the level of parliamentary debate by making it mandatory that legislation would only be considered  where it met with strict time lines&mdash;that is, bills have to be introduced before the cut-off date of 1 October. We have some 84 bills in 50 packages which these restrictive procedures have effectively undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear lots about whether people should participate in full parliamentary debate, but the whole proposition that was put before this Senate was to restrict the capacity of the House of Representatives to debate legislation. The whole idea was to frustrate the work of government. As we heard from Dr Hewson just last weekend, the whole strategy of the Liberal Party in this place is to refer as much business as it can to various committees in order to tie up this chamber, to filibuster, to prevent legislation passing. So when we talk about integrity and the work of government, we can see who is at fault in that regard. This is a very good government, but the opposition intends to make it a very bad government and to undermine the whole process of government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic function of the Senate, in the opposition's view, is to turn it from a house of review to an opposition grandstanding chamber. Not content to restrict the house of the people to try to limit its rightful job of managing government business, the opposition has on a daily basis taken up the time of the Senate with a string of inane motions, such as the one we have before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real point behind this is the fact that the Liberal Party, having faced five election defeats in a row, is under enormous strain. Paralysed by internal conflict and leadership speculation, constantly challenged by the few moderates who still remain within its ranks&mdash;that is, those who have not been purged&mdash;and devoid of any coherent policy since the election, the opposition has had to face complete rejection by the Australian people. To hide that basic fact the Liberal Party seeks to tie up the business of this chamber with meaningless motions such as that now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, on the other hand, has a clear agenda for building a new society looking towards the 1990s and beyond. The Australian Labor Party is leading the community debate on the sort of society we need, the sort of society we are trying to create as we face a new century. All institutions are under review in that process. We are examining critically all sorts of social relationships. No clearer point could be made than in the examination of our national identity. The budget's programs go to that very point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an extensive commitment to preserve Aboriginal culture and heritage, improved access for all Australians to cultural heritage through the expansion of and support for museums and other cultural institutions, and the establishment of the foundation for Australia's cultural development based in Melbourne, which will work with local government, community organisations, museums and other cultural bodies in the lead-up to the centenary. All of these are examples that come out of the budget which highlight the direction we are taking, which contrasts sharply with the inane propositions we have heard from the opposition today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also seeking to ensure that Australians outside the capital cities have access to art and culture, which the National Party does not seem to talk about too much. Art and culture do not really apply to the National Party; it is the sort of concept National Party members find beneath them to discuss. We are establishing national tourism programs. We are attempting to assist young artists. Over $2 million has been allocated to establish a festival of youth arts. All these are important issues. The Senate ought to recognise that there have been substantial benefits for a whole range of people in the areas of children's television, assistance to the government primary schools and the upgrading of the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sum of $1.1 billion growth funding has been provided in this budget to TAFE over the next four years. Currently 250,000 Victorians enjoy TAFE programs in Victoria. We do not hear anything about the positives of those programs from the opposition. The sum of $1.3 billion has been expended for labour market programs this year, which is an increase of $136 million. There have been further improvements in newstart and jobstart, improved consumer protection for renters, improved child-care facilities, with cash rebates of up to $28 a week for one child and $61 for two children. There is additional assistance for the introduction of child-care initiatives for sick children, the new dental health program, and measures to crack down on overservicing by doctors&mdash;medifraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason for this motion is that the forces that Senator Short represents in Victoria were defeated on the weekend, and this is a device to try to get over that fact. The opposition is looking for an opportunity to draw attention to, as it sees it, the government's failures and to hide its own. This follows numerous defeats in recent times as the opposition comes to the grips with the fact that it lost the last election and, the way it is going, it is going to lose the next. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry, when he was debating, talked about the integrity behind this budget, which at least is part of the motion. There is no integrity behind this budget. I was appreciative of the fact that Senator Kernot in her speech referred to the lack of integrity, the lack of cohesiveness, the lack of any direction, in the budget. That is something which the opposition has been pointing out ever since the budget was brought down. Senator Sherry did, however, purport to claim that the Liberals are in Disneyland in talking about carving dollars out of the budget. I would suggest that perhaps the boot is on the other foot. If there is anybody in Disneyland, it is the Labor Party, especially when evidenced by a diatribe like we have just received from Senator Carr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry also said that to say no negotiations, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) did, was not a silly thing to do. I think perhaps Senator Kernot has also dealt with that and I will not waste my time on it. We are not in the habit of putting out ambit claims for budgets in this country. We expect the government of the day, knowing the financial problems and situation of the nation, to put down a budget which is fair to the country, fair to the people of the country and which recognises the financial responsibilities that it has. If members of the government are listening to this community, as Senator Sherry was prepared to say they were, they must now be deafened because the people of Australia are speaking, and speaking non-stop; they are anguished about the budget which has been brought down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only today we have seen just what has happened as a result of the government's mismanagement, flowing through as it did into the foreign debt. An interesting thing in today's figures that I thought was particularly notable was the growth in the foreign debt that was caused by the public sector. The public sector net foreign debt has grown to $63.4 billion&mdash;an increase of $7.5 billion. That means that the public sector has been responsible for over 60 per cent of the increase in foreign debt in the last quarter. If that does not damn this government for its financial mismanagement, what will? What we are seeing with those figures is the burden that is being laid on our children and grandchildren. Never was such a stark example seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget is a disaster for all Australians, but my concern is particularly for those on low and middle incomes. They are the ones who really will suffer from the realities of this budget. As we know, the battling families have been hit with a raft of nasties, some of which my colleagues have already spoken about, yet apparently they have been bribed&mdash;if the government thinks they are foolish enough to be bribed by it again; I think it is sadly mistaken. The bribe is a magnanimous not quite $2 a week by way of compensation. Get this: that bribe does not get paid until the end of the financial year&mdash;after those families have been paying for all these tax increases for the whole of the financial year. Some compensation!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that in the Fightback package where there were going to be effects on family budgets we bent over backwards to make sure that compensation was not only payable but supergenerous so that those families in particular would have been protected from tax reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that we would all have to agree that the most appalling part of the budget is the bit that we do not hear so much about because it is not related to tax. It is the fact that there is no recipe for doing anything meaningful to change the unemployment status in this country. Every thinking person in this nation must weep tears of blood thinking of those people who stay on those unemployment queues for month after month after month. We all have family members now who have gone through the indignity of applying for the dole when they thought that never in their lifetime would they be dependent upon the welfare state, yet they have to accept that assistance because there is no hope of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now talk about the taxes. Even after the backdown measures of the government on leaded petrol, it will still increase by 7c a litre by February 1995. With the across-the-board increases in sales tax, families will pay more every time they venture into supermarkets and department stores. Let me mention again that there is no compensation for it&mdash;no real compensation at all&mdash;like there was in Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Think of the heavy smokers in low income families. In my experience, people who come to political offices for assistance who are disadvantaged are frequently very heavy smokers. Who would blame them? They need some comfort. But now this government has chosen to particularly target them. They will be slugged by more than $10 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families will also suffer more in getting pharmaceuticals. They will no longer receive drugs free after hitting the safety net and it will take longer to reach the net. That access to free drugs was particularly important to low income earners. I notice that the government's prediction for inflation is that it will be something like 3.5 per cent. Some people might dismiss that with a wave of the hand and not think too much about it. Once again, it is the low income earners who are particularly disadvantaged by inflation. We have heard some quotes here today. Let me quote. On the day after the budget, Martin Ferguson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wouldn't want to be a worker who drives a leaded vehicle or smokes or drinks because, frankly, they wouldn't be sitting at home in front of the television thinking about voting for John Dawkins in a double dissolution.</PARA>
<PARA>What about Michael Easson? He described the budget as an act of bastardry. Of course, he was referring to the retrospective ripping-off of tax from people's long service leave. What does his wife, the MP, Mrs Easson, have to say about that? We know what Merle Mitchell, the president of ACOSS, has said about the budget. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am extremely disappointed with (the) tax changes, a lack of action to bring down unemployment and a failure to implement recommendations on national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me tell the Senate what some of the Labor politicians in my home state of Tasmania have said about the government's budget. The honourable member for Bass, Mrs Smith, recently supported a call by the Tasmanian pensioners union for the price increase in leaded petrol to be scrapped, saying that the people of northern Tasmania already had high cost petrol. The honourable member for Franklin, Harry Quick, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmanians already pay higher petrol prices relative to the rest of Australia, and a tax on leaded petrol would mean Tasmanians would be relatively more disadvantaged by being required to assist in paying for a problem in the larger States.</PARA>
<PARA>Even our new ALP senator, Kay Denman, sworn in today, has expressed publicly her concern about the Medicare changes and the paltry $2 a week tax rebate. She has vowed to fight the petrol tax increases. Let them show their disgust. Let them cross the floor when these measures come to this parliament. Then we will take some notice of what they have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not forget that it is not just the taxes that this government has been deceiving the public about; there are the changes to Austudy and the changes to HECS&mdash;once again, particularly a problem to low income earners with several children. But at no stage during the election campaign did this government, trying to cadge for votes, tell those families that it would be making those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have 16-year-old secondary school students being moved from Austudy to the basic family payment. The rate at which the HECS will be clawed back is to be increased and the threshold is to be lowered to average weekly earnings. Ken Fowlie, the national president of the National Union of Students, summed up this attack by saying that the government had slugged the students to help it overcome its financial problems. There is somebody who has worked out that two and two make four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This home child-care allowance is another deceitful measure that the government promised during the election campaign and is now messing about with Australian families on. That will not be brought down for another 12 months. That means that the carers in the home, mostly women, will have been waiting more than a year and a half since the promise was first made. Anyway, it is a pea in a thimble trick because it is cashing out the dependent spouse rebate, and the net gain to a family in a week will be $2.80. It hardly indicates a real commitment to mothers in the home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not forget the optometry benefits. The changes there will mean that there will be a $50 for a first consultation fee and $25 for a follow-up consultation for average families. At the moment they pay nothing because 90 per cent of the optometrists bulkbill. This is effectively a tax on spectacle wearers of about $50 a year. It is in clear breach of the government's election platform. The Optometrists Association pointed out in its press release that was made available to members and senators that the government was talking before the election about its platform which included optometrists' services and it said, `all Australians are entitled to exactly the same quality of care'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was talking about Medicare. Yet here we see the first step in dismantling Medicare. During the election campaign the government spent its time trying to portray the opposition as wreckers of Medicare when in fact our concern was that Medicare needed support and improvement. Because this government is not prepared to take the measures necessary to support Medicare by encouraging private health insurance, it is having to further ration health resources. We have rationing of pharmaceuticals. We now have rationing of opticals. We have rationing of physiotherapy. We have rationing of hospital beds. That is because this government is not governing properly for all Australians. The health budget fails to tackle in any substantive way the real problems in the health portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are claims that the government is going to reduce medical fraud and overservicing. That is quite unbelievable because its previous activity does not indicate any commitment to reducing any fraud or overservicing that is present. The funding in the budget to reduce hospital queues is inadequate and it is an effort of sleight of hand. At first sight we would think that the government was introducing the first stage of its election promise of $100 million over four years to reduce queues, but if we look at it more closely we see that it is just not true. Last year there was an existing program and the government committed $48 million to the states and territories to reduce waiting times. This financial year that program will get only $12.4 million. But the government is introducing a new program this year to which it has allocated an additional $12.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have after that sleight of hand is a reduction of about $36 million in the old program and an amount of $12.4 million in the new program. That means that the moneys available for getting extra hospital beds out of the private sector appears to be about $23.6 million less than last year. So much for that election promise. It was not a very good promise anyway because it would have reduced the number of people privately insured. We have seen the rationing, we know what the government is up to, and it is simply not up to managing the health care of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson, in announcing his expansion for palliative care services, has pointed out that there is a need for people to die with dignity, but Australian families want to live in dignity rather than with the continuous struggle they have now to keep their heads above water. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman continues to argue Fightback. Judgment has been passed on it. It is like the outcome of the Liberal Party federal council at the weekend. The council looked back in anger on Australian history. The Liberal Party seems incapable of looking to the future, of looking to the next century of our constitutional development, to the next century of our political framework.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen as a consequence of the determination made at the Liberal Party's federal council at the weekend is just as has occurred on every occasion this century. When the nation takes a step forward, the conservative parties will be found, at best, in the baggage train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem the coalition faces is reflected in the urgency motion. It cannot accept the result of the general election of 13 March. Four defeats in a row were a lot to absorb&mdash;there is no question about that; the Labor Party has been there and understands that&mdash;but a fifth consecutive defeat was more than anyone in the coalition could comprehend or was prepared to concede. So that is why we have a circumstance in which the coalition in the Senate seeks only to delay, obstruct or frustrate the measures of the elected government, just as occurred previously in our history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the election has been raised in the course of the debate, I recall the night of 13 March vividly&mdash;the tally room, the looks on people's faces. Senator Newman raises the state of Tasmania. Of course, it was the state of Tasmania that started the landslide against the coalition, an absolute and utter landslide. Why did that happen? It happened primarily because people could see first-hand, through the actions of the Groom government on industrial relations, what was likely to be superimposed on that system by the prescriptions of Fightback. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a matter of the GST, and Senator Newman deludes herself if she thinks the electorate merely rejected that tax. True, it has had a savage impact where it has been introduced elsewhere in the world, as the conservative government in Canada will find out in a couple of months. But the coalition deludes itself in thinking the election loss was merely because of the GST. It has to look at the whole value system that was bound up in the Fightback package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An American friend of mine said to me over dinner late last year&mdash;he was on his way back to the United States after having spent a sabbatical in Australia looking at federalism&mdash;`Why on earth is the coalition in this country running on a platform that Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan ran on in 1979 and 1980 respectively?'. The best answer I could give was that the coalition really believed that the decade of the 1980s was theirs but that it had been snatched from them by the Labor Party. Labor had gone on in national government to introduce landmark reforms right across the board in terms of internationalising the Australian economy and modernising our economic framework. While Thatcher and Reagan had been in power in the UK and the United States respectively, the coalition felt cheated. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events of 1974 and 1975 were not pleasant experiences for anyone. They were not pleasant experiences for the Australian people, who were forced to an election for a Labor government again in 1974 and forced, about 18 months later, to yet another ballot in December of 1975. They were forced to the polls when the government should simply have been allowed to run its full term, its three-year cycle. I have always believed that if the government had gone its full cycle there probably would have been a change at the end of 1975. If it had gone a full cycle from May 1974 to May 1977, there probably would have been a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not good enough for those opposite. They would like to use their raw numbers in the Senate to usurp the role of the House of Representatives and to force the government to the polls. That is precisely what Senator McGauran said earlier. He said, `Absolutely' when I asked a rhetorical question. If people are silly enough to respond to rhetorical questions and get themselves on the public record, they can wear it. That is the kind of vandalism of the democratic parliamentary processes that all of us ought to reject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was something else said here a week or so ago. Senator Hill rose to speak. From the conservative back benches someone made the remark to the President, who was in the chair at the time, that `The majority leader must be heard'. That is a term alien to Australian politics; it has no place in our system. That is a reference to the United States Senate, which unquestionably has greater constitutional authority than this Senate. It is reflective and indicative of thinking opposite&mdash;that this place has greater powers than the House of Representatives in our constitutional framework, as the opposition maintained during 1974 and 1975. That is why we</PARA>
<PARA>see these arbitrary limitations placed upon a government's capacity to legislate; that is why, in matter of days or weeks, a government is expected to have all its budget legislation drafted, debated and in place to come to the Senate chamber. That is an absolute nonsense. Again, that is the vandalism of our democratic parliamentary processes which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Mr Beazley have referred to over past weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a lot of things that can be said in support of this current budget&mdash;the four-year framework, the development of labour market programs and the deficit reduction strategy. A whole range of issues can be canvassed in a light very positive to the Labor government. I am more than pleased to do that. From the perspective of Australian history, it is very important to get those opposite on the record tonight as to what their real agenda is. There is no effective budget reply, no matter whether we read Senator Bishop's speech or Dr Hewson's speech. We can take either of them; there is no effective budget reply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those opposite are doing is delaying, obstructing and frustrating.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of what the budget sets out to do, I want to make a couple of points about health and one or two other policy areas because it is important that they be re-enforced. For example, the federal government, through the office of Senator Richardson, the new health minister, is about cracking down on fraud and cheating in health. We are not doing this in an arbitrary way; it is not to be done by the 5 a.m. doorknock. It is being done in cooperation with the Australian Medical Association and the Health Insurance Commission.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Loosley has given an interesting speech. At the beginning of his speech he mentioned that Tasmania led the charge in returning the Labor government at the 13 March election. That is true. He also mentioned that one of the factors involved was the Groom government's industrial relations legislation. That, also, was a factor. I engaged in a very vigorous public campaign on television and radio as well as through speaking engagements against those measures because I thought they were putting the boot unfairly into the workers of my state. At a time when unemployment was so high, it was giving an unfair advantage to employers and encouraging unscrupulous employers to have a competitive advantage over the more responsible employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It remains to be seen whether this government's Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) will go along that particular track. If that is going to be the case, that will be a double deception of the people of Tasmania because a very important factor which influenced voters in Tasmania was the concern over the GST. Make no error about that; the people of Tasmania know the effect of indirect taxes on them. That was a matter of genuine concern. This budget has ignored the community's justifiable concern. It has not only ignored it, but it has also treated the people with contempt because this budget will impact upon regional Australia and Tasmania more than upon other states or other people in other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is remarkable about this budget is its lack of historical vision for this country. After all, in the words of Edmund Barton, federation was supposed to recognise that this was a continent for a people and a people for a continent. No small part of that vision was the linking together of the Australian colonies into one great common market. What is being done now by the government's measures&mdash;for example, in the fuel tax area&mdash;is to disadvantage many outlying areas of the Commonwealth, including my state of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is a document not only of deceit but also of contradiction. In his budget speech, Mr Dawkins speaks of Australia becoming more competitive and of the tyranny of distance giving way to the benefit of proximity to Asia-Pacific markets. His own budget actions, which of course speak louder than words, proceed to hobble a large part of our transport infrastructure with additional fuel tax burdens. Not only land transport, which is bad enough, but also shipping will bear the brunt of the additional imposts on petrol and diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incredibly, the excise on marine fuel is to rise by 92 per cent by August next year. Any gains in productivity on the wharves and in our coastal shipping trade is being snatched from the people of Tasmania by the federal Treasury. In case one did not guess, the federal government has no plans to compensate Tasmanians for the increased costs across Bass Strait through proper adjustment of the freight equalisation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the way that the government appears to be taking advice from the Treasury on a number of issues. I pointed one out&mdash;credit unions and friendly societies&mdash;this afternoon in a question to the minister representing the Treasurer. I pointed out that Fisher based his views of these institutions on some very fundamental principles which are at the heart of the labour movement and which were at the heart of the Labor Party. I pointed out that in 1974 Treasurer Crean overcame a decision of the High Court by giving credit unions tax exempt status. I asked the minister to tell the Senate what principles now motivate the Treasurer. They are not Labor Party principles&mdash;they are not traditional Labor principles&mdash;because those decisions will affect the worker and workers' organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real failure of this budget is this: it fails to deal with what I believe is probably the most important economic and social question facing this country, and that is chronic unemployment. My feeling, and the feeling of a lot of people in the community, is that we are not in a recession but a painful transition to a situation of continuous drops in standards of living, with a permanent underclass of unemployed and underemployed. In that situation, one would have expected better from this government. But this government does nothing to tackle the unemployment question. It does nothing to look at the question of the participation rate in the paid work force. If the participation rate now was the same as it was 20 years ago, theoretically, in all events, there would be four per cent unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of winning three lower seats and a Senate seat from Labor was never going to be easy, particularly in view of the formidable trade union campaign waged against us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While as a professional campaigner I must congratulate the Labor Party on its victory on 13 March, I note that a clear majority of South Australians voted for a change of government and for the policies of the Liberal Party. I have no doubt they will also vote for a change of government at the impending state election in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state of South Australia is suffering significant economic problems which are bound to sweep away the incumbent government. The $3 billion South Australian State Bank debt is the disastrous proof of the wisdom of my long held view that governments should avoid involvement in the ownership and operation of business enterprises. The government's role in the economic life of the state and nation is to set the rules and act as umpire, and to avoid being one of the players. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conflict of interest inherent in performing both roles invariably produces disastrous outcomes as we have seen not only in South Australia but also in Western Australia and Victoria. This government, to its credit, has at last accepted the need to privatise federal business entities. However, I urge it to move with the greatest possible speed towards extricating itself from the improper role of commercial player. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern politics is in many ways a debate about the proper role of government. It is gratifying that in several areas the Labor Party has, albeit reluctantly and slowly, accepted the Liberal view of the role of government in relation to privatisation, the deregulation of the financial sector and opening up the Australian economy to international competition. It is to be hoped that this government, which clearly is as surprised by its victory as anyone, will accept the need to press on with structural reform of the economy, including reform of the labour market, as has been advocated by my party for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for economic reform is no more clearly highlighted than in Australia's horrifying level of unemployment, which is a matter for national shame in a country with our assets. Unemployment is acute in my state of South Australia, which frequently records the highest jobless rate of any mainland state. Federal policy must surely have as its overriding objective a massive reduction in the numbers of people who cannot find a job. A situation in which almost one million Australians are unemployed must be unacceptable to every member of the Commonwealth parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every practice and policy of government should be critically assessed against the backdrop of mass unemployment. The poverty, depression and human misery occasioned by unemployment are intolerable in a country like ours. The millions of Australians affected by unemployment are no doubt frustrated and angry that while they suffer, the national political debate is dominated by discussions of Mabo and the republic.

My responsibility is not to be ideologically correct but to seek out practical solutions to our number one problem&mdash;mass unemployment. My support for giving managers and workers greater freedom to negotiate their own industrial relations arrangements is based not on ideology but on a desire for good outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current level of unemployment sends out one clear message about our industrial relations arrangements&mdash;they are simply not working. The federal parliament has a responsibility to do everything possible to ensure that our industrial relations arrangements operate so as to maximise employment. That responsibility applies to every facet of federal activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view every piece of legislation should be subject to an employment impact test. If the proposed law is likely to restrict employment opportunities, then a heavy onus rests on its proponents to say why it should be passed. Indeed, such a test should certainly be applied to the proposed increase in the wine tax. Real job growth can only occur when businesses are sufficiently healthy to be able to employ more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am an unashamed advocate of pro-business policies for that simple reason. A strong, growing business community will employ more Australians. That growth will be a function of the internationalisation of the Australian economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the courage of a great South Australian Liberal, Bert Kelly, who has fought so hard to demonstrate the benefits of free trade. Australian businesses must be given every opportunity to penetrate overseas markets, which provide the potential for continuous growth in our living standards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great economic principle to which I subscribe is that of competition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation is another area where real reform is required if we are to maximise employment opportunities. The tragedy of the recent election campaign is its effect on the great cause of tax reform. Almost every objective Australian with an understanding of our tax system believes we must broaden the tax base by replacing our wholesale sales tax with a value added tax on goods and services and commensurate reductions in income tax. No-one has argued the case better than our current Prime Minister, who was unfortunately ambushed by the unions in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To his credit, John Hewson put policy virtue ahead of political reality in convincing my party to advocate such a proposal prior to the last election. As a professional campaigner I was not at all surprised that our political opponents made the GST the centrepiece of their campaign, and effectively diverted attention from their record in office. However, as an Australian concerned about our country's economic future, I despair that the 1993 election means more wasted years of struggling under the burden of a hopelessly inefficient tax system which is a barrier to higher employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 election confirmed that an opposition will almost certainly never win by promising a new tax. The only way we will achieve sensible tax reform is by an incumbent government, with bipartisan support, biting the bullet. I hope this government will have the courage to put the national interest first and replace our ramshackle indirect tax system with some form of broad based, value added tax as advocated by the Prime Minister in 1985. It is absolute madness for Australia to tax its exports in the way that occurs under our current tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any discussion of unemployment must address the impact upon the supply of labour in the 1980s caused by high immigration and the increase in the number of women, particularly women with dependent children, entering the paid work force. Net immigration from 1982 to 1992 was just over one million people&mdash;an increase of nearly 50 per cent on the previous decade. In the past decade the female work force participation rate has increased by 40 per cent. Since July 1984 the number of married women in the labour force with dependent children has increased by 27 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government policies have played a big part in the significant increase in the supply of labour in the last decade which puts an even greater responsibility upon the federal government to have policies which result in a high demand for labour. Immigration has declined to a net 62,700 in 1992-93 and, in my view, should stay within that figure into the foreseeable future. Women are now reaping the benefits of years of struggle to achieve equal opportunity in the paid work force. However, I have a particular concern for those women with dependent children who have been forced by economic circumstance to seek paid employment when they would prefer to be concentrating on their role as mothers and homemakers. </PARA>

My interest lies in seeking to restore a realistic choice to those women with dependent children who want to devote themselves to the jobs of mother and homemaker which, for far too long, have been undervalued. The nurture and care of children should be celebrated and those who undertake this task need all our support. </PARA>

Mothers who want to be with their children in those critical preschool years should be given that choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Federal Government should introduce a single universal form of child rearing assistance to replace all existing child care and child rearing allowances and subsidies. This single method of assistance could take the form of a tax credit or benefit paid to all mothers with dependent children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a firm believer in policies designed to maximise choice and equity, I find it unjust that families in which the mother sacrifices her earning potential to be a full time mother and homemaker end up subsidising, through their taxes, the costs of child care for mothers who have paid employment. Equity demands that mothers with dependent children be treated equally by way of a benefit replacing all other child related allowances and subsidies. </PARA>

Those pressures are a significant factor in family breakdown, divorce, domestic violence, disturbed children, youth suicide and rising crime.

Consistent with my strong support for maximising individual choice, I hold firmly to the view that Australians should be free to choose not to vote in federal elections. I am delighted that the Liberal Party of South Australia is committed to the introduction of voluntary voting following the next state election and I look forward to the federal coalition adopting voluntary voting as policy. I am pleased that our federal council has just reaffirmed its support for voluntary voting. </PARA>

My 14 years full time work as a senior official of the Liberal Party has convinced me of the need to end compulsion. It is a distasteful anachronism that should be abandoned in the interests of the health of our democracy. I regret that while our political opponents continue to believe that they gain an advantage from compulsion, we are likely to continue being one of the very few countries in the world where a voter can actually end up going to gaol for choosing not to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take this opportunity to note that I am only the second state director of the Liberal Party to be elected to the Senate. The first was Sir John Carrick, a former Leader of the Government in the Senate and a man for whom I have the highest regard. Sir John's devotion to the development of a culture of cooperation in Australian workplaces to replace our culture of conflict is something I admire and share. I happen to believe that the skills and experience acquired in full time party employment are an appropriate background for a parliamentary career. </PARA>

The Liberal Party is more favourably disposed to granting Senate preselection to its former state presidents, five of whom currently serve as senators in this place&mdash;all with great distinction, I might add. I do note that the Labor Party has a very different approach to this issue, as is evidenced by the fact that five former national and state secretaries of the party are currently serving in the Senate. </PARA>

Sir Stewart remained Premier for only three months; I trust that my tenure in the Senate lasts a little longer than that. I had another great great grandfather who was the first director of the Adelaide Zoo&mdash;an occupation not unlike that of director of a political party but one which is no doubt viewed by the public as much more worthy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come into the Senate as a primary producer and woolgrower, recognising that for prosperity our nation needs a healthy farm sector. I know the hurt felt by farmers is not a statistic; they are flesh and blood, they have been my flesh and blood for four generations and they have recently had a hell of a time.

Fortunately for them, he said they could remain in their accommodation until things turned around. I doubt whether this farmer will ever recover. His flock has been reduced from 18,000 sheep to 6,000. His agistment and feed bill have broken him, but his spirit is unbowed.

Without it, the modern Labor Party might not have had its beginnings in the woolsheds of Queensland in the 1890s. Without wool and of course gold in the early days, there would never have been the inland infrastructure and development from last century until recent times. Without wool Australia would, more than ever, be a nation of coastal dwellers, and certainly our standard of living would have been lower. The nation owes all primary producers and all our export earners a great debt.

However, it is our last chance to get it right. The government must listen to the industry and confidence must be restored in the auction market by whatever means. The opportunity now exists to increase wool's share of world fibre markets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>When the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation was initially reappointed on 30 May 1993, a specific term of reference was to inquire into and report on the operations of the Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund, known as the QPOASF. This report, the eighth report of the Select Committee on Superannuation, is actually being debated before the sixth and seventh reports, which you presented to this Senate during the last sitting period, Mr President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These earlier reports were developed under the dedicated and efficient chairmanship of Senator Nick Sherry. I remind the Senate that under Senator Sherry's leadership the committee met on 93 occasions during a two-year long inquiry. I think it is a tribute to both the chair and to the members that only on two or three occasions did that committee divide. By any standard, that is a remarkable achievement and a tribute to the potential that parliamentary committees have in breaking down party political differences, which are often based on ideology as opposed to sound logic. I trust that under my chairmanship the committee will continue to work in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry into the Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund grew out of a submission from one Mr Desmond O'Neill, received by the committee in November 1992 under its original terms of reference. While this submission included material and various allegations outside the scope of the committee's work, one significant matter involved the transfer of funds out of the QPOASF to certain beneficiaries in 1987. That transfer and matters related to it provided the focus for this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The QPOASF was established under a trust deed on 11 June 1985. It was sponsored by the QPOA and the Professional Officers (Queensland) Credit Union for the benefit of the employees of those two organisations. As provided in the trust deed, the trustees change over time but are always the president, the treasurer and general secretary of the QPOA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiative to pursue an inquiry was not without precedent. In its earlier work, the committee's attention had been drawn to a number of instances of maladministration of superannuation funds. In its first report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Super</EMPHASIS>, the committee reported on two funds, ABC Engineering and Byrnwood, where trustees had not properly discharged their duties. With the QPOASF the issues raised were germane to several of the committee's original terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also saw the opportunity to reassess the adequacy of superannuation supervisory legislation now proposed by the parliament. After receipt of the O'Neill submission, the inquiry actually followed three stages. The first involved seeking the responses of persons and organisations named in the submission. In the next stage the committee held two public hearings in Brisbane in April and May 1993 where a number of witnesses gave oral evidence and various documents were tabled. Finally, the report on the inquiry was drafted and discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of its inquiry, the committee experienced problems in confining the evidence to matters relevant to its work. This was because amongst those involved with this fund were complainants about various activities of the executive of the QPOA which were not necessarily connected with superannuation. Some of these matters have been examined by the Cooke inquiry and the Criminal Justice Commission in Queensland and debated in that state's parliament. The committee encountered claim and counterclaim in connection with the QPOASF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in spite of the obvious differences of opinion on the part of the witnesses about the operations of the fund, a number of unanimous conclusions and recommendations have been made by the committee. The first and the most important is that in a number of respects the trustees of the fund breached their fiduciary responsibility to their beneficiary members. The committee was unable to examine a proper set of minutes for meetings of trustees but was informed that trustee decisions were taken when the trustees were present at council meetings of the employer, namely QPOA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was unable to establish that the trustees treated fund members equally. It would appear from the evidence available that trustees decided that four of the beneficiaries should be singled out for special treatment and then allowed to transfer their superannuation entitlements into a private super fund. As these four members were not leaving the service of the QPOA or the credit union, the trustee proscribed this action. This wrongful action was compounded by the fact that two of the beneficiaries received entitlements beyond the vesting provisions of the fund. A report of the actuaries, Towers Perrin, who were contracted by QPOA, found that the excess withdrawals by three of the fund members would require the employer sponsor topping the fund up by $34,000. Incidentally, Towers Perrin congratulated the committee on the production of its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the story does not end there. The committee found that there was an attempt to ensure that the membership did not find out about the wrongful transfers. Members claimed that they were not provided with information about the fund, not given details of retrospective changes to the trust deed to legitimise the transactions, and not given the opportunity to participate in the scheme to allow for private superannuation accounts. Had the trustees been doing their job, they would have sought proper advice from the fund administrators or consulted with somebody with expertise in trust law prior to sanctioning the withdrawals. The trustees were unable to provide the committee with any evidence of their seeking expert advice. Had they sought that advice, one of the trustees who stood to gain from the transfers would have stepped aside when the decision was taken. By his own admission that trustee became involved in a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which was a cause of considerable concern was the inability of agencies connected with the fund to provide the committee with copies of key documents. If the committee came close to establishing that there was contact which warranted prosecution, it was when it probed the benefit request forms. But it was unable to get them. In fact, the benefit request forms for the QPOASF provided the employer and the trustee with a mechanism to advise the administrator to transfer the benefits to the individual funds. The authorised officer who signed those forms apparently ticked the `leaving service' box. This box was ticked because leaving service was the only way under the trust deed other than the death of a member that allowed the funds to be transferred. The trouble with this is that none of the four beneficiaries was actually leaving the service of the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the committee tried to obtain a copy of these forms, it entered into a round robin  or `flick passing' competition which at best could be described as farcical and at worst an attempt to deprive the committee of its evidence. The QPOASF could not find a copy of these forms. National Mutual said that it had given its only copies of the forms to the Cooke inquiry. The Cooke inquiry by way of letters from the State Archivist and the Department of Industrial Relations informed the committee that it had forwarded the documents to National Mutual. National Mutual said that it had received a batch of documents but that the four benefit request forms were missing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of observations that I wish to make about this farce. The first is that none of the organisations contacted by the committee showed any evidence of keeping copies of documents. I find this an extraordinary state of affairs. The second is that none of the organisations showed any evidence of keeping a register of incoming or outgoing documents by name, by recipient or by donor. The committee was so concerned about this state of affairs that in an unusual move it has recommended that the Queensland Attorney-General and Minister for Justice investigate the circumstances surrounding this so-called loss of documents. The committee has further recommended that the Queensland government review its archiving policy to ensure that proper records are kept and that retention of evidence tendered at quasi-judicial inquiries becomes standard practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the sums of money involved in the irregular dealings of the QPOASF were small in comparison to the stock of national superannuation assets, the principles at stake were great. Those fund members and former members who were concerned about the administration of the fund were frustrated in their attempts to search for the truth. They tried the EARC, the CJC and the Cooke inquiry but it was the Select Committee on Superannuation which gave them a fair hearing without the need for the legal trappings. The cost of legal representation at some of the quasi-judicial hearings which preceded the committee's hearings could only be described as astronomical. The committee's hearing on the other hand provided witnesses with a low-cost yet equitable environment in which to express their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the only other avenue for an aggrieved superannuation fund member is the state equity court, which has jurisdiction over trust law disputes. The committee is pleased that the government intends to set up some sort of legislation for a low-cost and accessible dispute resolution mechanism. This matter will be before the committee when it considers the superannuation industry supervision bills this month. The QPOAS report allowed the committee to consider yet again the need for far-reaching legislation to govern the way superannuation trusts operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of the report the committee concludes that it will use a number of principles to test the legislation currently before the parliament. These principles are: trustees should give members access to any information about changes which may materially influence their superannuation fund; trustees should act in an impartial manner, ensuring that potential or actual conflicts of interest are avoided; trustees should become aware of the provisions of the trust deed which they administer and seek advice should they be uncertain about the correctness of their actions; trustees have an obligation to inform members about proposed changes to the trust deed and to seek their views; and, finally, members should have access to a low-cost dispute resolution mechanism should they wish to challenge a ruling of their trustees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry, therefore, has been a very productive exercise. It has established that there were irregularities in the operations of the QPOASF and it has allowed the committee to make further conclusions about the nature and shape of the new superannuation regulatory regime. In fact, one of the spin-offs of the inquiry is that a detailed report has been produced on what not to do on being a trustee or administrator of a superannuation fund. I expect that the report will be much sought after by trustees, employers and fund administrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I note that this report has been commented on in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Queensland. It does distress me that the producer of this program has for some reason been sacked. I think this is a deplorable situation but I do commend the report to the Senate.</PARA>

As I am only a recent appointee to the Select Committee on Superannuation and did not attend the hearings, I will limit my remarks to matters that have not been canvassed by the chairman, Senator Watson. This report clearly demonstrates that in the case of the Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund, a Senate committee was the only agency which Mr O'Neill, the person who triggered the inquiry, could turn to. It is indeed disappointing that a state body was unable to examine in detail the operations of that fund.</PARA></TALK.START>

I was distressed to hear that $300,000 had been spent on legal, administrative and actuarial fees in getting&mdash;or perhaps, in truth, not getting&mdash;to the truth of the matter. The committee has inquired into the matter to the best of its ability and within the confines of its very limited terms of reference. Had the committee been able to access the documents in question&mdash;that is, the four benefit request forms&mdash;its findings may have had even more force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent seven years in the superannuation industry prior to entering parliament. Some of the matters that were raised during the hearings on this particular reference relating to the Queensland Professional Officers Association were to me quite incredible, in particular, the apparent loss of documentation. Superannuation is a very difficult subject for many Australians to understand and they rely on the knowledge and the integrity of others to make sure that their funds are well administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still well remember the plethora of forms that I was required to fill in, in order that there would always be a record of any transactions that took place. Sometimes even those filling them in felt the forms were going to some sort of an excess, but it was done in order that there would always be a record, usually in triplicate&mdash;one owned by the person who signed it, one owned by the company and one to be stored for records. To me, the fact that those forms could not be found by anybody during the investigation of this hearing is just an amazing situation and it certainly left the committee wondering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that this matter is now in the hands of the parliament to pass laws to strengthen the prudential control of superannuation funds. The SIS bills have been drafted to do this and the committee will be examining these bills in the coming weeks. The matter is now also in the hands of the Queensland Attorney-General, who has been advised by the committee to inquire into and report on those missing documents. The Queensland government will also need to ensure that it has a more secure archiving system which does not have the capacity to lose such important documents as those that were lost during the course of this hearing or prior to this hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At stake in this fund was about $30,000 dollars which, when it was disputed, cost the employer, the union and the credit union more than $300,000. This is a fact which has not been disputed. I am concerned that in the future larger amounts of money will be lost from the superannuation system as a consequence of fraud, malpractice or maladministration. That is why this parliament must act to make sure that superannuation moneys are more secure. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that with the funding provided for 1993-94, especially as regards overtime, it will be difficult for the department to continue to provide services at the current levels. Moreover, provision has not been made for the higher printing costs which were experienced in 1992-93 and this will also lead to difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>I also observe that, again, the Department of Finance failed to provide adequate opportunity for there to be meaningful negotiations between the Department of Finance and the responsible minister and the Department of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a member of that committee, that as far back as 1982 a resolution of the Senate noted a number of things, not the least being the right and responsibility of the Senate to establish its own appropriations. It observed that in the event of agreement not being reached between the President of the Senate, then the Leader of the Government in the Senate, as a member of the Appropriations and Staffing Standing Committee, should be consulted. It also observed, inter alia, that, in turn, the Senate expects the government of the day to take into consideration the role and responsibilities of the Senate which are not of the executive government and which may at times involve conflict with the executive government. I emphasise that that was in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, in 1985 the committee and the Senate as a whole reaffirmed their resolution, requiring the Minister for Finance to process the Senate department's estimates as early as practicable to enable any differences between the Minister and the committee to be resolved in accordance with the resolution and expects that the resolution will be adhered to in determining those estimates for the future. As has been observed on every occasion in the last decade, the Minister for Finance and the Department of Finance have failed to fulfil their obligations and responsibilities in respect of that resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that Senator Graham Richardson chaired the Estimates Committee A in 1982 that constructed the resolution which was unanimously carried by the Senate. Yet on this occasion we find that the department wrote to the Minister for Finance on 26 May 1993, forwarding the committee's deliberations and determinations in respect of the amounts judged necessary to be concluded in the parliamentary appropriation bill. This did not occur until 5 August 1993, but a handful of days prior to the budget being brought down, which made it quite impractical, and in real terms quite impossible, for there to be negotiations, consideration and deliberations between the Minister for Finance, the appropriate minister and the estimates committee. In fact, to put it another way, it was simply a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $992,000 had been taken off the appropriations for the Senate and the Senate was told that at a date so late it was impossible for there to be any deliberations. I note that the President, Senator Sibraa, continues to write to the relevant minister and to the Minister for Finance drawing the resolution of the Senate to the attention of the government, but it seems that that resolution is treated with capricious and reckless disregard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not need to remind you of the distinction between the executive chamber of the parliament and the Senate. Now is not the time or the place to give the Senate a lecture about that. We are a chamber of second deliberation; we are a chamber of second consideration; and we are a chamber that has an opportunity to examine legislation with care and commitment, clause by clause. We are a chamber which is able to reflect upon and consider the intentions of the government by way of its legislation and its other activities. One of the foundations of that opportunity manifests itself in the committees. On this occasion the level of appropriation has prejudiced the prospects of those committees properly and carefully to examine legislation as it comes before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say no more, except that it goes back to the time of the Stuart kings when governments starved the parliament, with the deliberate intention of ensuring that they did not function properly. I well remember a previous Minister for Finance, Senator Peter Walsh, threatening that he would ensure there was not appropriate funding to allow for proper consideration of the legislation if we referred any more legislation to committees. In other words, the functions of the parliament would be strangled by the funding of the government. </PARA>

His intention on that occasion was to ensure that the Senate did not properly examine legislation. I do not suggest that on this occasion that is the intention, but whether it be the intention or not, the result and effect are exactly the same. We now find ourselves in a situation where committees, which are forever daily attracting greater responsibilities and greater workloads, are now finding themselves prejudiced in terms of being able to fulfil their obligations and commitments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dare say that there would hardly be anyone amongst us, other than the executive, who would argue that the role of the committees in the Senate is not an intrinsic and valuable functioning of this chamber which provides a proper check and balance on government. When that unique function is prejudiced, it prejudices the very system of government in Australia. I can do no more than hope that on the next occasion, if there is disagreement between the executive and the parliament in respect of funding, the due processes set down in resolutions in 1982, 1985 and 1993 will be set in place in a proper way so that the mechanisms will allow for a resolution of those disagreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cute advantage of not entering into negotiations until it is too late is that one does not have to justify one's position. The executive simply will be able to take off $992,000 from the funding of this Senate and not put forward one argument in justification. That is where we find ourselves at present. The minister on the committee was at a loss to be able to explain the cuts because he had not been advised either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious in taking cognisance of the resolutions of the Senate&mdash;and if those members of the Senate who belong to the government are prepared to accept the fundamental responsibility of the parliamentary system&mdash;I will expect on the next occasion to see a timely consideration of the differences. I hope that the Department of Finance understands the difference between the process of arriving at appropriations by the Senate and by other departments. We already find ourselves disadvantaged by this crazy efficiency discount, which simply does not apply to the Department of the Senate. I trust that we will not find ourselves having to go through this debate again in 12 months time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak to this report as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. I do so in a totally bipartisan and, I suppose, non-partisan way, because I think this is the way that this matter should be addressed. This committee is an all party committee. It unanimously considered, as in this report, that, with the funding provided for 1993-94, it would be difficult for the Department of the Senate to continue to provide services at the current level. Services to whom? Services to us. One might say, `That's a big deal; services to senators', but they are services that enable us to perform our proper functions in the interests of the people who have elected us. It is a very serious matter indeed for a committee unanimously to say that, with the funding that is now provided, it will be difficult for the Senate to continue to provide services at the current level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter. We on the committee request and insist upon the officers of the Senate justifying all their proposals for funding. As Senator Crichton-Browne has indicated, we have arrived at the situation where no negotiations have taken place, and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has simply knocked off about one million bucks in funding and left it too late for any negotiations to take place. Quite frankly, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you know from your former position&mdash;which you held with such distinction&mdash;that is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were informed that the minister has now responded that there will be a review undertaken jointly by the Department of the Senate and the Department of Finance of the workload of Senate committees and the appropriateness of current support arrangements. The review will determine the efficiency of the current structure, the resource requirements of the committees, including estimates committees, the committee office and the most appropriate method of measuring committee workloads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 3 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clerk of the Senate advised the committee that while he had some doubt that a reliable measure of committee workload can be developed, he had no in-principle objection to a review being conducted of the department's support arrangements for committees. The review would take place after estimates committees have considered the 1993-94 estimates under the new procedures, and will enable a more accurate determination to be made of the likely staffing resources required by estimates committees under the new procedures.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee will receive that report, but it must be borne in mind that we in this chamber refer an enormous number of issues to particular committees. If we refer them to the committees, we expect the committees to do a job on them. I suppose that, of all things in this parliament, the committees are essential to our representative functions, because they enable ordinary citizens&mdash;people in all parts of  Australia&mdash;to  make  submissions  to  let us know how they feel about matters that are being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Minister for Finance that in these straitened times every effort should be made to make savings. I agree with that very strongly. I and my staff personally make every effort to make as many savings as we possibly can. But when the committee has gone through the budget proposals of its officers who, in turn, have gone through their cost-cutting measures, and made a recommendation, and then been knocked off by the Minister for Finance for almost one million bucks out of an appropriation of $22 million&mdash;that is a lot of money&mdash;it is no wonder that we came to the conclusion that, under the existing arrangements, it `will be difficult' for the Department of the Senate to continue to provide services at current levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply rise tonight to alert honourable senators to that factor. If senators happen not to get the services that they think they require to undertake their responsibilities to their electors, they should not blame us, because this is a unanimous decision. We have warned them about it. I hope that everybody around the chamber will be able to indicate in their various ways and use their good offices to get the government to recognise that these are important issues. We should not be in a situation where it will be difficult to provide service to senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that we do not go down the track that might be ultimately necessary of separating the supply bills, so that those dealing with the parliament can be dealt with separately from those dealing with the executive government departments. It may come to that. The parliament may have to consider separate bills for the allocation of moneys which are appropriate for the parliament to exercise properly its functions. I do not know whether I would like to see that, but it is important for the government to understand that that may be the end result of any non-cooperative approach it may continue to take in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should properly consider the recommendations that emerge from the examination of the current support programs and the recommendations that are made by the Senate staffing and appropriations committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>I will deal, first of all, with the report on ministerial portfolios. The Auditor-General provides this parliament with great assistance. His reports into the activities of government departments and other organisations provide us with a level of information which is vital in exercising our tasks effectively. The timing of these reports is also important in that we are, at present, undergoing the Senate estimates procedure where there are many appropriate questions to be asked of the departments and the ministers arising from the reports of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal not with the individual reports on each department, which, as I said, provide material for the Senate estimates procedure, because it would be duplicating in this chamber what we are doing so interestingly until the early hours of the morning in our committees&mdash;I believe one sat until 2 o'clock the other morning&mdash;but to deal with a current report in Audit Report No. 1 relating to cross-portfolio audits. The Auditor-General deals in a more general sense with some matters affecting various departments. In particular, I want to deal with two matters: firstly, financial administration and management effectiveness audits and, secondly, adherence to finance directive 2F&mdash;are in-house services fully costed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first inquiry was into a series of small performance audits of financial administration and management activities in a number of departments and agencies which disclosed, according to the Auditor-General, a need for tighter controls particularly in devolved organisations. The Auditor-General said that senior management of departments and agencies needs to ensure that tests of accountability and cost effectiveness are met. He said that the management of property operations, procurements and debt needs particular attention. This is a vital element of any government's management and, fortunately, the Auditor-General has been able to establish where there is clear need for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in 1992-93 that the audit office undertook a number of these small performance audits. They enabled the audit office to review some of the effects of the substantial devolution of financial management responsibilities to managers in state, regional and local offices. This is important because, as the Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such managers are now responsible for ensuring control over a substantial element of the . . . $11b or so of annual expenditure on the administration of government programs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General finds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst many audits indicated good results in local administration, the majority of audits resulted in detailed recommendations to agencies and substantial action by them, aimed at improving performance, greater control over resources, compliance with the law, or greater economy and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>In general, they do indicate areas of vulnerability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this is so important, and why I want to draw it to the attention of the Senate, is that this is the same Auditor-General who is being squeezed for resources by this government; who had to make an announcement just before the budget that because this government was not providing him and his office with adequate resources he was putting off 100 employees. So here is the Auditor-General pointing out while there is the need for significant improvements that would save this government multimillions of dollars of taxpayers' money, he is being squeezed for resources and will not have the capacity to make these sorts of inquiries. It seems just crazy, unless one looks for other motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it in this government's best interests for it not to be embarrassed by Auditor-General's reports pointing out that things could have been done better, that some managements are slack and that they should smarten up? In one of the small performance audits the Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope for savings of at least $3 million in administrative expenses was identified.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General also looked at accommodation and property management. He notes that there has been some disagreement about what should happen to incentives for new tenants, such as rent free periods and cash incentives, which are now commonplace in property market operations, and whether the department should get the benefit of the cash free period or incentive payments or whether the money should be paid into consolidated revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does raise the question that if there are all these incentives, such as rent free periods for new tenants, how come the Auditor-General's office is being forced by this government to pay a massively excessive rent to occupy the Australian Labor Party's head office building in Canberra? This matter has never be satisfactorily resolved. I would have thought, in view of the present situation, that the Labor Party would have been offering the Auditor-General a discount and perhaps a cash rebate in order to get its space occupied rather than have this incredible ratchetting up system whereby, as time goes by, it has to keep paying an even higher rent than the excessive rent it is already paying. The Auditor-General does make some comment about ratchetting up rents, and I will come to that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office, as it says in this report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has commented in the past on the need for agencies with housing stock for purposes of staff rental to consider carefully the appropriateness of their housing stock levels. The ANAO identified one agency which had over 200 residential properties, valued in excess of $20m. The ANAO found that there was a need for the agency to rationalise and divest itself of residences in a number of locations where an adequate private rental market existed. In addition, rental contributions from employees were low, resulting in a negative return on investments. The agency has accepted the ANAO recommendations concerning the need for review and rationalisation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why it is so vital that the audit office has adequate resources so it can save taxpayers' money in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO noted cases where organisations did not have sufficiently clear national policy and planning arrangements for their accommodation needs. The need for effective review mechanisms was identified in one instance where `dead rent' of some $1.3m may have been incurred for leases which were no longer required because of a move to new premises.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not incredible? Dead rent of $1.3 million was unnecessarily paid. The audit office notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiation entered into following ANAO recommendations led to the agency saving $0.5m of this exposure.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is another half a million dollars saved by proper inquiries by the Auditor-General, these sorts of inquiries being obviously put to some sort of risk by this government squeezing the resources of this money saving organisation&mdash;the audit office. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANAO identified the case of an agency leasing a number of large offices in CBD or high rent areas at above current market rents.</PARA>
<PARA>This seems to relate to the Auditor-General's office itself which was, as I understand it, forced into the situation where it had to become the tenant of the Australian Labor Party at a rent in excess of the current market rate. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO estimates that the excess of annual rent above market rent for 1992-93 was some $3 million. This included $1 million due to the effect of `ratchet' clauses, which prevent any downward adjustment of rents in declining markets.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to be pointing the finger at one particular deal&mdash;the one that the government imposed on the Auditor-General himself to occupy a ratchetted up rental situation. The Auditor-General also observed instances of inadequate documentation of procurement decisions. He says that this meant that it was not clear to the audit office that value for money had been sought or obtained. There were instances of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.no limit indicated on the amount of a purchase order</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.no formal contracts between the Government agency and suppliers of services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.tender documents of unsuccessful tenderers destroyed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder what is happening to the failed tender documents of those people in the broadcasting area who are involved in the farce of tendering for the satellite and the other curious broadcasting contracts that the government has made such a mess of. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.purchase order requests which did not sufficiently justify the purchase of goods and services (including consultancies)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is amazing where some of these consultancies seem to go&mdash;and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.insufficient documentation of how quotes were evaluated and why successful tenderers were selected.</PARA>
<PARA>In many instances we are often inclined to wonder why various successful tenderers were successful in the circumstances. There is one fascinating situation which the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) who is at the table, knows of only too well. That is the matter of a $4.9 million contract which was investigated at some length the other night in Senate estimates committee hearings, a contract which has gone to an organisation the principals of which appear to be very friendly to various members of the Labor Party. The tender was a farce, naturally, and the people who actually provided the work&mdash;many of them disabled people&mdash;have in fact not been paid for the work they did for this agency, this organisation, which claimed to be acting on behalf of the government because it had this contract. It looked like a mates contract. One of the principals had sought some time ago, unsuccessfully, to be a Senate candidate for a political party. There is no need to guess which political party. Other examples of deficient procurement practices include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a duplicate payment to a supplier of $380 000 as a result of a breakdown of controls within an organisation's accounting area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.goods and services received or cheques raised prior to the raising of purchase orders. This practice could lead to unnecessary purchases being made or funds not being available to pay for the goods and services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.payments made in advance of need (which the ANAO estimated in one instance provided a benefit to the suppliers concerned of $40 000 in interest)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>surely the government should have got the benefit of that, not the supplier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">and inadequate acquittal processes for payments made in advance, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.incomplete specifications leading to incorrect goods and services being provided to Government bodies.</PARA>
<PARA>I will briefly deal with the question of adherence to finance direction 25F which relates to in-house services and whether they are being fully costed. Finance direction 25F requires that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a Commonwealth department or agency that operates on the public account produces or plans to produce goods or services that would otherwise be purchased on a commercial basis from the private sector or another Commonwealth body (e.g. the Department of Administrative Services) such in-house production must be justified having regard to its full cost to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the audit found that, while departments affirmed their intention to obtain value for money, the in-house production of services was usually not justified in accordance with Finance Direction 25F. For example, in relation to printing facilities costings undertaken were not complete and values were not attributed to such features as security, confidentiality and convenience.</PARA>
<PARA>They are obviously important matters but the departments have to establish that there is a reasonable value applied to those which overwhelms the need to get it done at the cheapest possible price, which may often be from an organisation outside the department. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the majority of property functions such as leasing, construction and fit-out did not require such justification as they were supplied under contract by the agencies of the Department of Arts and Administrative Services . . . On the other hand, property-related functions such as the co-ordination of repairs and maintenance and other facilities management requirements were provided in-house without the cost justification required by the Finance Direction.</PARA>
<PARA>What concerns me is that there is a need to ensure that Commonwealth agencies thoroughly and regularly review their operation and regularly assess the potential for gains in efficiency and effectiveness from competitive tendering leading to contracting out. Another problem is not simply the question of saving money; it is whether or not some departments are empire builders and seek to increase the scope of their activities. One area in particular that concerns me is the making of film or television video material. Film Australia used to have a monopoly over this. I must say I am not in favour of such monopolies and I think the removal of that monopoly was a sound idea so that departments could seek to get the best possible deal from wherever they could. The problem now is that there seems to be some evidence that some departments are in fact building up in-house empires that have the capacity to provide facilities that would be much better supplied by Film Australia, for which I have a very high regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final comment relates to print reproduction services. The report states that in response to an estimates question from Senator Parer, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet `sought to briefly justify its printing facilities'. Senator Parer asked whether they could be justified and whether the printing could not be done cheaper outside. An extensive evaluation was not considered warranted by the department because it considered that an in-house facility was obviously cheaper than external suppliers. However, the report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then, the Department has completed a review of departmental corporate services where outsourcing options for a number of services including photocopying, stores and consumables and library services, were being considered.</PARA>
<PARA>At last it is now recognising that the Auditor-General's view that the department had not sought to justify the existence of the facility in accordance with the direction, but rather relied on a short analysis in response to Senator Parer's question, was not enough. The audit office `considered that this exercise could not be viewed as a quantification of the full costs of the Department's printing facilities'. This goes on through quite a lot of departments which simply have ignored the requirement to ensure that they got the best deal done to save taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the failure to follow this procedure is also evident in the Department of Primary Industry and Energy, particularly in the management of properties in the states, which is carried out in the regional offices of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. The Auditor-General found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The justification and supporting cost analysis for the establishment of the property management function did not meet the requirements of Finance Direction 25F. The on-going allocation of resources to facilities management was also not evaluated in accordance with the Direction.</PARA>
<PARA>Is it not fortunate that the Auditor-General is prepared to show the government and departments where the government's own requirements are not being met? I think the Auditor-General is playing a vital role, a role that this Senate should support with great enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note in passing that many other audits are in progress, as noted in the back of this report. One of them is an audit into Australia's preparedness for marine oil spills, which may interest the Australian Democrats, who so often seem to express great concern about these matters. I hope they will be supporting the Auditor-General in his endeavours to examine this thoroughly. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An audit of Australia's preparedness to deal with a major marine oil spill is in progress. The primary focus of the audit is on the adequacy of contingency planning arrangements, with particular emphasis on the integration of the various levels of Federal, State and Industry response, completeness of the plans and the regularity of update.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the report of the audit will be tabled in the 1994 Autumn Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA>I look forward to looking at that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I mention it is to demonstrate that the Auditor-General is not simply looking at simple annual returns, annual reports and figures. He has a significant social role in this parliamentary process of reporting to this parliament. That is why I am so angered by the attempts of this government to cut back on the resources of such a vital organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report by the Auditor-General&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Report No. 2: Project Audit: Australian Bureau of Statistics</EMPHASIS>&mdash;contains some matters that should be brought to the attention of the Senate, particularly matters relating to the confidentiality of important computer material. There has been a lot of discussion in the past about the census and how many people are uneasy about the volume of information that the census collects, particularly as it is personal information. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the information collected in the Census is of a private or confidential nature. As a result, the ABS has an obligation to protect the confidentiality of the information collected in the Census.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says that the same situation applies to many other similar surveys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to assure the Australian people&mdash;I am glad the Auditor-General has done this&mdash;that the report has concluded that the Australian Bureau of Statistics computer system could not be used to facilitate the release of personal information in contravention to the law. In other words, the computer information that emerges from the census is simply not available to anyone who could identify that personal information through the computer system. There is information in printed form which is destroyed by the Bureau of Statistics. I stress that there is no capacity for the computer to provide personal information relating to individual respondents. I think that is a very important finding by the Auditor-General and should bring comfort to those people who are uneasy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the Auditor-General has pointed to some problems that I think we should recognise. While the Auditor-General says that the ABS computing environment is not able to be accessed from outside the premises of the Bureau of Statistics, the risk to the security of ABS information is confined to individuals&mdash;by the way, it does not relate to the census, because the original information is not put into the computer&mdash;from within the ABS to whom the statutes apply. The problem is that the ABS multi-user computer platforms hold aggregated information of significant commercial value&mdash;for example, what the balance of payments and the unemployment figures will be, as well as a whole range of very significant matters which affect markets. In the opinion of the audit office, security of these computer platforms is inadequate. That is a very serious problem. The audit office therefore considers that sensitive aggregate information is unnecessarily vulnerable to unauthorised access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that I have often been concerned about the fact that just before some official statistics come out about various matters of substance, senior governmental people suggest that the figure will be very bad or at the top end of the range. It seems a consistent pattern. Then a couple of days later the figure for, say, the balance of payments comes out and it is not as bad as the government had led one to believe. Everyone says, `Isn't that marvellous? The deficit this month is only $1 billion instead of $1.2 billion'. We have to recognise it is the difference between someone being run over by a 15-tonne truck and being mown down by a 12-tonne truck: the person has still been run over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about this continual pattern of what appear to be governmental leaks&mdash;the government certainly appears to be well informed&mdash;of information that is about to come out. They are always a little worse than they eventually turn out to be. So the media response is, `They're not quite as bad, thank heavens. Isn't that wonderful?'. The proper response should be, `This is a disgraceful, disastrous figure'. It just happens too often.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I am very concerned when I see that in the opinion of the audit office security of these computer platforms is inadequate, and that  the Auditor-General considers that `sensitive aggregate information is unnecessarily vulnerable to unauthorised access'. The major factors the Auditor-General says contribute to the inadequacy of the ABS computer system are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the time of the audit, there was no approved ABS IT security policy . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">users are not required to be personally accountable for their use of the computer system in all situations . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This situation results from the use of functional computer user identification codes rather than codes which are uniquely identifiable to a given user&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . password usage on network and mid-range computers is not adequate . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . privileged access to the mainframe is granted too freely . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There are therefore too many staff members whose actions, whilst logged into the computer system, cannot be directly controlled or accounted for and the design and use of the mainframe database system does not provide for the proper identification and authentication of users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General says that the ABS accepted all 15 recommendations, three of which were accepted in principle, and is taking action to implement them. But I still say that it is a matter of major concern to me that this has taken place. This lack of personal accountability is clearly a weakness in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General believes that the weakness is because the ABS does not assign user IDs, which is the functional user identification, on a personal basis, in that the system promotes sharing of user IDs and passwords. Where user IDs are shared, actions performed on the computer system cannot be traced back to source. The ability to make users personally accountable for their actions while logged into the computer system is fundamental to the achievement of a satisfactory standard of computer security. I am glad that the ABS is now accepting over time the Auditor-General's recommendations. The Auditor-General does say, particularly in respect of one important point, that the response of the Bureau of Statistics will, when implemented, meet the thrust of the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise for taking much longer than I had intended, but this is a very important matter. Many other matters should be raised, particularly the fact that the current level of security on the Unix and LAN platforms is below the standard that would be required for the protection of sensitive statistical information within ABS. I hope that these improvements do take place. I commend the Auditor-General for his very effective reporting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would firstly make the observation that it is a pity in a way that the wording of the motion does not more accurately reflect the remarks that have just been made by the Acting Manager of Government Business, the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan). The motion looks very open-ended. I refer to the Minister's remarks about the Senate authorising:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the extension of the House Monitoring Service television coverage of the proceedings of the Senate and Senate committees to persons and organisations, as determined by the President, on terms and conditions determined by the President.</PARA>
<PARA>We discussed this today at our party meeting and felt that it was not possible to determine exactly what was being intended,  how far it was intended to go and what sort of organisations might be included. Generally, it was the view of senators that this ought to be something that is determined by the President. Originally, broadcasting arrangements were discussed in this chamber and determined by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the minister might consider rewording the motion so that it does more accurately reflect what has been discussed. I know that a number of senators feel that the coverage ought not be extended in line with what is covered in this motion. A number of issues came up in relation to how far coverage could go, how selective it could be, what sort of things might be included in it and other matters of a like nature. When I first read the motion I felt that it did not give any indication of what was behind it or what was intended. The minister's explanation gives some further elucidation of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be better for the motion to be held over and considered on another occasion when we have had an opportunity to reflect more accurately upon it. I do not know whether the Senate would pass the motion as it stands, but at least we now have some of the words and thoughts from the government as to what the motion actually means. One of my colleagues suggested to me that the motion should include the words, `on terms and conditions determined by the President or the Deputy President'. Another suggested that it ought to be a matter `determined by the Senate'. But at least we now know what the government is talking about, and I think that is useful.

<PARA>I would like to take just 45 seconds to emphasise to the coalition that this is yet another opportunity to vote for its own policy&mdash;the policy described by Senator Tambling in his speech during the second reading debate on the bill to establish the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, which I now seek to amend. During the second reading debate, Senator Tambling said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Bruce Lloyd, pointed out in his speech during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives that he was unaware of any other country in the world where producers are required to pay in full, as this Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>now the act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">requires, for a public health facility.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in his speech Senator Tambling said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As these are Budget Bills, the coalition parties will not be opposing them. However, as Mr Lloyd has already said in his speech during the second reading debate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I emphasise this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on being elected to government, the coalition will amend this legislation and return to 50 per cent cost recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what this bill offers, and I invite the coalition to support it. I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my second reading speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the previous few weeks the Coalition has made a remarkable discovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has discovered that the senate can deal with, and amend, measures imposing taxes and that it can modify bills amending charges or levies. Last year we were repeatedly told by the Coalition Senators that these sorts of things were really Budget bills and couldn't be tampered with. As a result of that view, thousands and thousands of pensioners became pretty upset with the efforts of Coalition Senators when they allowed the Pensioners Shares Bill to pass through the Senate last December. Senator Patterson, for example, well knows that they are extremely angry with the Coalition on this issue. Pensioners know that if it hadn't been for Senator Patterson and her colleagues, they would not now be selling their shares and ringing up Democrat Senators for advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am surprised that a lot more farmers are not just as angry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year we considered a truckload of bills dealing with levies to pay for the National Residue Survey. The Democrats regard this Survey as quite useful and sensible. We need it because we seem to think that we have to keep on throwing chemicals all over the place and at everything that moves in order to grow a decent carrot or potato. Unfortunately we also know that there can be too much of the stuff, with the consequent severe risk to the health of those of us who finish up eating the produce. For that reason we have set up a testing program, monitoring the residues of chemicals left in our produce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However there are a number of criticisms of the survey.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many argue that export produce dominates at the expense of produce for domestic consumption&mdash;particularly fruit and vegetables. We are not saying that there is too much testing of export produce; indeed we have some concern about the absence of residue testing of Tasmanian potatoes for example and I will be investigating that further. Rather the concern is about the limited testing of agricultural produce for domestic use. There is also concern about the range of chemicals tested and this is another area I will come back to on another occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other criticism, and the one being addressed by this bill is the funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently a levy is placed on producers. On producers whether or not they use chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite simply the funds for the survey should be met from the source of the need for the testing; that is the chemicals. The funds for the survey should come from the sale of the chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed just today I lodged a petition about this issue and its incompatibility with principles of ecologically sustainable development. The petition requests that the Australian Government place a levy on the sale of agricultural chemicals, in proportion to the toxicity of the chemicals. It goes on to note that the practice is incompatible with the principles of ecologically sustainable development about which this government trumpets so much when it suits it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just as we now recognise that the polluter should pay for the costs of polluting, so should the chemical manufacturers be required to pay for the monitoring of chemical residues in our food.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For now though we would settle for 50%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is actually the policy of the Coalition and we would expect that they would vote for their policy. Believing that the Coalition would actually support its own policy, I moved the content of this bill as an amendment to the levy Bills introduced last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However I was very surprised to find that they weren't interested in their policy. They simply wanted to support the government. It was a budget Bill we heard. Referring to my amendment at the time, Senator Tambling explained how the Coalition, and I quote,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"believes that it is a reasonable apportionment of the public health situation versus the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats agree, we said so, and I moved the amendments. The Coalition voted them down. They said they were Budget Bills, and anyway they were going to win the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I quote again from Senator Tambling:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"on being elected to Government, the Coalition will amend this legislation (that is, the levy Bills) and return to 50% cost recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But of course the Coalition didn't win the election and just as on the Pensioner Shares issue where thousands of pensioners are left with the choice of selling their shares, the farmers affected by this legislation have no further recourse. Perhaps I am being too cynical but it smacks of pure political cynicism. The Coalition's dirty work was actually done by the Government while the Coalition wallowed in the luxury of having a policy that couldn't get implemented. The Coalition should come clean; it had no intention of repealing the Pensioner Shares Bill, it had no intention of reducing the Residue Survey levy on farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that is not right, Mr President if they did intend to implement their policy they will support this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have come full circle. The coalition has come to realise that the Senate can after all deal with these sorts of measures. So they have the chance, today, to prove that what they say is what they do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly rise with pleasure to speak on this debate this evening. It is a measure that has been around for a mighty long time. I can remember that in all the years Senator Button was here he tried get it through. I point out to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, to the whole chamber and anyone who cares to be listening tonight that I have no problem with this legislation involving the declaration of senators' interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in local government in Western Australia, councillors' interests had to be disclosed if they were voting on a matter that they may have had interest in. There was no such formality to declare councillors' interests, as the government is asking for now. There was simply a book to sign if one was thinking of voting on a matter in which one may have had an interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was shire president, I used to wait for people to declare their interests before the discussions started. I used to throw the book at them to sign. Once they had declared their interests, they were not allowed to take part in the debate or to vote. Furthermore, when that debate was over and the motion was passed or lost, it had to be noted in the minutes that councillor such and such was not entitled to vote and did not vote. So I am used to that sort of thing, and I am not frightened of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and anyone else here in this chamber: what is the use of the form that Senator Gareth Evans's motion has proposed for the declaration of senators' interests? Last May he went through the fiasco&mdash;if I may call it that&mdash;of getting the Labor senators to declare their interests. I will come to them in a moment. As I said, I am not worried about any such sort of declaration, except in relation to points that I will come to later. But I must ask: what does it achieve?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To find out what it achieves, I looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Register of Members' Interests</EMPHASIS> of the 36th parliament. I flicked open a few pages and took the first example that I saw, which was none other than Laurence John Brereton who is in the other chamber. I went through the details, not because he was Mr Brereton but just to see what these declarations exposed to the Senate and to the people of Australia. The first heading states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shareholdings in public and private companies (including holding companies) indicating the name of company or companies. </PARA>
<PARA>For himself, he put down, `Nil', which I presume is the situation. For his spouse, he put down, `Not known to me'. The next heading is `Family and business trusts and nominee companies'. I suppose if all these things are there, they are supposed to be filled in to the best of one's knowledge. Once again, for himself he said, `Nil' and for his spouse he said, `Not known to me'. For his dependent children he said, `Nil'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next one, which refers to the nature of operation, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in which the Member, the Member's spouse, or a child who is wholly of mainly dependent on the Member for support, is a trustee (but not including a trustee of an estate where no beneficial interest is held by the Member . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, Mr Brereton said, `Nil' and for his spouse he said, `Not known to me'. On the question of real estate, he put down his property, his home and a weekender and then for his spouse he said, `See above'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We move on to registered directorships, For himself, once again he said, `Nil' and for his spouse he said, `Not known to me'. The next heading states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Partnerships indicating the nature of the interests and the activities of the partnership.</PARA>
<PARA>For himself he said, `Nil' and for his spouse he said, `Not known to me'. Then No. 6 refers to the nature of overdrafts, liabilities et cetera, and he explains his own situation. This time he knew what was going on with his spouse because he said, `See above'. For the next one relating to bonds, debentures, et cetera, once again, for himself he said, `Nil' and for his spouse he said, `Not known to me'. So what one can know about one's spouse can be a bit selective. The next heading states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Savings or investment accounts, indicating their nature and the name of the bank or other institutions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>For himself he said, `Nil' and for his spouse he said, `Not known to me'. Then he goes on to say what his children are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, how can Mr Brereton&mdash;who seems to have children and obviously a wife, though he does not seem to know what she is doing at all&mdash;not run a bank account? I would like to know where Mr Brereton's pay goes, whether it goes into a bank account or whether this parliament sends out cash in an envelope. I would just like to know how one can operate a family situation and not have a bank account? I thought for a while that one did not have to declare cheque accounts, but then I looked at other members and senators who have disclosed their cheque accounts. But in this case nothing was disclosed at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The form goes on to refer to the nature of other assets. Mr Brereton states that he has part share of two boats, et cetera. The next one refers to other substantial sources of income. For himself he said, `Nil' and for his spouse he said, `Not known to me'. The form continues and he is asked about membership of organisations he belongs to. The final one is No. 14, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any other interest where a conflict of interest with a member's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise.</PARA>
<PARA>For himself he said `Nil', and for his wife `Not known to me'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stupidity of this legislation is the fact that the form is there for those concerned to disclose these details. I object myself to disclosing the spouse's situation, but in this case here one can get around that by saying, `Not known to me'. I believe that if one shares a home and a family life with one's spouse, one has some idea of what is going on in one's spouse's life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also when one looks at a fellow like Mr Brereton, who is a minister in this government, one may say that he is a man of very moderate means. It hardly seems right that a minister does not have a bank account. But Mr Brereton is a very presentable fellow; he is well dressed; he mixes with the best of company; he took leave when in Europe to attend a high society wedding in London. I expect then that he has a bank account, or at least has some knowledge of what his spouse does or does not do. Surely there should either be a section relating to the spouse which we should complete, or no section at all. We should not accept the stupid excuse of the person concerned being unaware of what the spouse is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then I picked up another declaration. It happened to belong to Senator Gareth Evans, who caused this situation in the first place, and who lashed the opposition because we were not in a hurry. Section 9 of the statement of registrable interests asks for details of `the nature of any other assets (excluding household and personal effects) each valued at over $5,000. Maybe Senator Evans was in a hurry with this section. It is a bit hard to understand his writing, anyhow.  But I have looked at this section to find where a motor car fits&mdash;there is no other place it could fit&mdash;and, as I have seen other declarations showing motor cars under section 9, I presume from this that Senator Evans does not own a car, or at any rate a car worth over $5,000. Going on the average age of Australian cars, any car that is worthy of a minister to drive should be worth $5,000. But there is nothing mentioned. So what do these forms mean? What do they tell us? They tell us nothing whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, including Senator Evans, made big play of the fact that Labor Party members had filled in these forms so  I went through the forms of the ordinary people on the other side, the ones who are not ministers. I saw Senator Cooney's form but I turned his over, and I came to Senator Childs. Senator Childs went through his form and completed it but it is unsigned. It has been tabled unsigned. So what are these documents worth?  They are not worth the paper they are written on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else do these forms show? They show that you may have a bank account; it does not tell anyone how much you have in the bank account. You are asked about liabilities. I do not think you are asked for details of the extent of the liabilities. So the whole lot is a sham, especially considering one form has been tabled unsigned. I take it that more than half the senators opposite do not own a car. I take it that a few ministers of the government do not know what their spouses are doing. I maintain that if you share a life with a spouse you must have an idea of what their situation is. If you do not, you should not be pretending that it is a family unit. If we are going to have sections asking for spouses' details, let us fill them in properly or let us not fill them in at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask what all this achieves. There is a wide range of declarations that worries me. It worries me that we have to disclose what a spouse is doing. We also have to disclose details regarding children `wholly or mainly maintained'. In this day of equal opportunity, I find it rather insulting that I have to disclose my spouse's situation. There is more than one reason for that. I might be like Mr Brereton, and not know what my wife is doing. But I do claim that I know. It may embarrass my wife in regard to what she has. It might embarrass her more in regard to what she does not have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I come to the children. When do children become independent? Sometimes they return to your dependency. Even my party room laughed when I said that, but it does happen. Senator McMullan is smiling at that one, but has he not had the experience I have had and that dozens of others have had? Children may finish a degree, work for a few years and then go back and do a higher degree. The government is not very benevolent towards them; someone has to keep them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Someone has to keep them while they are doing that second degree or higher study. So what do you?  You bring them back home. Then you have to ask your grown-up children exactly what they own. I believe that this is a futile exercise as it stands now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go through some of the finer points of the situation. The resolution says that within 28 days of making or subscribing an oath each senator shall provide a statement of that senator's registrable interests of which the senator is aware. But I might be like Mr Brereton and not be aware of what exactly I own and what I do not own. You have to register the details of yourself, your spouse and your children. If a senator or member is a share-trader&mdash;and I presume we are expected to share in the equity of Australia and Australian businesses and invest in businesses that may produce for Australia; I presume there is nothing to be ashamed of in being a share-trader or a share investor&mdash;then what do we have to do? We have to put in an updated version every 28 days.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 1(2) of the resolution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That any Senator who:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) knowingly fails to provide a statement of registrable interests to the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Registrar . . . by the due date;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) knowingly fails to notify any alteration . . . </PARA>
<PARA>that is, every time you buy and sell a share you have to notify that alteration&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">within 28 days of the change occurring;</PARA>
<PARA>you might have sold those shares off again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">shall be guilty. . . </PARA>
<PARA>But it says `knowingly'. There are not many places where you can use not knowing as a defence. The tax department does not take as a defence that you were not aware of something. So once again as far as I am concerned you can drive a bus through the measures of this registration of senators' interests. This government is trying to create the impression around Australia that members of the coalition might not be the most honest of people. That is all government members are trying to do. They went through the stupid exercise of declaring their interests and having to table them and yet one of them was not signed. I could speak all night on this issue, but unfortunately I am running out of time. Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to pay tribute to, and express my condolences on the death of, a great Tasmanian and a great Australian who is a former member of the other place, the House of Representatives, Charles William Jackson Falkinder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charles Falkinder was born on 29 August 1921 in Tasmania. He had not long left school when he enlisted in the RAAF on 27 May 1940 at the age of 19. He served with tremendous distinction in British bomber squadrons in the European theatres of war. In fact, he released the first bomb over Europe on 6 June 1944, D-day, the invasion of Normandy, which signalled the beginning of a rapid end for Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill Falkinder rose rapidly through the ranks of commissioned officers in the RAAF and ended the war as the most decorated bomber-navigator in the RAAF. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in 1943 with bar the year after. In 1945 he was accorded the very great honour of the Distinguished Service Order. A bomber crew's life was short and tenuous, yet Bill Falkinder flew a remarkable 107 sorties during the war in both heavy bombers and mosquito bombers, the famous plywood planes which required the bravest and the most daring pilots and navigators in order to be flown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war his brilliant career continued. On 28 September 1946 he was elected to the Commonwealth parliament representing the southern Tasmanian seat of Denison. At the time of his election he was just 25 years of age, the youngest person ever elected at that time to the federal parliament. Indeed, the Liberal Party had then been in existence but two years. Bill Falkinder was one of the very first group of candidates elected as members of the Liberal Party only; that is, candidates who had never been elected under the name of another party. Bill Falkinder and his parliamentary peers in the Liberal Party in 1946 presaged the great and seminal election victory in 1949. In 1946, they were harbingers of this victory three years later and of the golden age that Australia was to enjoy for the next two decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill Falkinder retired from politics, perhaps prematurely, at the age of 46 on 31 October 1966. He had enjoyed re-election to his seat seven consecutive times after 1946. As a politician, Bill Falkinder was forthright and articulate. His primary concern, however, was always with the men and women of his electorate who had actually put him into parliament. We would all do well to consider the way in which this man of such considerable achievements and stature never forgot those who put him into parliament and why he was there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He understood better than most that his role was to serve his constituents. In fact, his maiden speech dealt with a scheme in existence at the time which was of assistance to the apple and pear orchardists of his state. Some may have thought that a prosaic topic with which to commence a parliamentary career, but Bill Falkinder knew that to his constituents there was not a topic of more interest and importance at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his last speech on the budget in 1966 Bill Falkinder warned against the dangers of elective dictatorship, to borrow Lord Hailsham's phrase, by the executive. These were not the words of a mere back bench dissentient, but the assertions of a man of principle who believed strongly in the virtues of representative democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criticising what he termed the deluded view of the divine right of cabinets, he argued that backbenchers had given away their rights as individuals to have an expression in what becomes law through parliament. Such remarks are perhaps even more apposite three decades later and those opposite may do well to note his comments. Following his resignation from parliament, he worked in Sydney as a public relations consultant, finally retiring in 1980 whereupon he returned to his home town of Hobart to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill Falkinder represents or symbolises a number of things. For Liberals he represents what must have been a fascinating and exciting period&mdash;the birth of the Liberal Party and its first dramatic successes. As a parliamentarian, he represented the Australia of the 1950s and 1960s, a time now falsely excoriated as cloistered and dull by historical revisionists for their own shabby political purposes. It was in truth a time of unparalleled growth, prosperity and contentment. In the 1990s, the placidity of that time does not seem such an unenviable quality. Above all, Australia was then a land at peace with itself, a state we can now only aspire to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, Bill Falkinder represents the brave and courageous young men who fought for Australia's liberty so selflessly in World War II. We should never allow ourselves to forget that it was the sacrifices of these young men and of their fathers a generation before in the Great War that enable us to live in the free and rich society that Australia is today. A man of many parts, I, as a Tasmanian, take special pride in Bill Falkinder being a son of my state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Justin O'Byrne would like to join me in these expressions of condolence. Justin is a former young Australian fighter pilot in the air battles over Europe. Like Bill Falkinder, Justin served in the parliament for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I express my condolences to Patricia, his children, Suzanne and Christopher, and his five grandchildren, Amanda, Mark, Fiona, Nicholas and Aruna. Vale Bill Falkinder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A recent declaration by the World Health Organisation that toxic chemicals and the illnesses they cause are the plague of the present decade is a chilling thought. But in view of the stories that I have been presenting to the Senate over the past 12 months, and will continue to present to the Senate, that should not come as any surprise. Indeed, a colleague of mine has recently put it very succinctly. Sufferers of chemically induced illnesses will soon be making claims in courts that will make the asbestos fiasco look like pocket money for the pictures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to find a way now to redress this scourge that we have created. The most effective way to do that is to open up the channels of information. A number of members of this government used to be very vocal about the need for open government. Of course, that was before they came into government. The first time around they were perhaps a little more vocal, but now we do not hear very much about that cliche of open government. It is a long time back. There were prophets who would talk in the style of Ralph Nader and they would quote his famous piece of wisdom that information is the currency of democracy. There is now a genuine developing pressure to significantly open up the information files on chemicals to the general public. The sooner the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the example of Mancozeb. Mancozeb is a fungicide used in potato production. It is marketed under the names of Mazeb, Dithane 945 or Dithane M45. Information which is supplied with the product says that inhalation, skin absorption, eye contact and ingestion may be harmful and that the effects of overexposure, acute overexposure and chronic overexposure are not known. The safety data sheet supplied by one company says that Mancozeb is considered to be practically non-harmful by all exposure routes, while prolonged skin exposure may lead to mild irritation or dermatic effects. In other words, what we are being told is that it is not exactly a cordial, but then it is not particularly dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chemical name is Maneb. I have here a copy of a hazardous substance fact sheet provided by the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maneb can affect you when breathed in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maneb should be handled as a Carcinogen&mdash;with extreme caution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overexposure can irritate the nose, throat and eyes. Repeated skin contact can cause a rash.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High or repeated exposures may interfere with thyroid function, cause damage to the nervous system, affect liver function, or cause kidney damage.</PARA>
<PARA>The Canadian facts sheet includes much more: it suggests workplace exposure limits, ways of reducing exposure, health hazard information, medical testing, workplace controls, protective equipment and emergency advice. All this is important information. It is produced by the New Jersey Department of Health and is not generally available in Australia. What we are told is something slightly different. One of the strongest criticisms that I have been hearing over recent months is just that&mdash;that information is not readily available. There is concerted reluctance, and in many cases even a refusal, to provide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, I can quote the example of a constituent of mine who came into my office for help the other day. In the course of his work, labouring on a Tasmanian government project, he was required to apply chemicals from a can marked `Mineral turpentine'. No advice about safety or protective equipment was supplied to him. After suffering some horrific skin ulcerations and loss of sleep for weeks at a time, headaches, kidney and abdominal pains, he found that he had been exposed to Agent Orange. It had taken several years of persistently battering the bureaucracy to get information, which should have been supplied when he was asked to administer whatever it was in that can marked `Mineral turpentine'. The information came too late for him to be able to use it through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People should not have to resort to freedom of information provisions on these issues, nor should they have to go through a bureaucratic minefield of stonewalling evasion or even hostility, as was the case with Lorinna residents in Tasmania recently, to whom I will refer in a moment. People should not have to go through that sort of messing about to obtain the information from overseas. It should be available here. United States experience suggests that public access to information about chemicals through a legislative framework is an important means of promoting a safer environment, reducing the usage of toxic chemicals and preventing pollution and initiating clean methods of production. These are all issues that are now too important to be trusted simply to the secrecy of government and industry, which are trying to make a profit from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Australian chemical industry, sensing that the tide of public opinion is gaining support in its demands for greater access to information about the chemicals it produces, has undertaken the development of a responsible care program. Part of this program is the inclusion of a version of community consultation. The extent to which that is translated into action remains to be seen because so far industry has baulked at disclosing information about its products, making the usual claim of commercial considerations. That is the record so far. This is all we have to judge these companies by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public consultation is still an illusive concept and it does mean different things to different people. Because the need has now become so urgent and important, because the issues have literally become a matter of life and death for so many people and because our agricultural resource base is under threat, nothing less than full disclosure of the relevant information upon request can be acceptable. Nothing less than a national information resource providing information on formulation, toxicology, exposure data, labelling and legal, health and medical data on all toxic chemicals is required. It must occur and I will be pursuing this during these sittings. </PARA>

This was a special school for children with a wide range of disabilities. That school closed down after reactions to the children following a routine spraying for argentine ants. Although it was authoritatively claimed at the time that everybody was suffering from a winter virus, many attribute the `emotive reaction' to the toxic chemicals which were used on that site. Not only has there been no obligation on authorities to provide the full information after investigations, there was a clear refusal to even consider that insecticide poisoning had been responsible for what occurred; yet the authorities saw fit to close down the site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We increasingly have situations where people are expected to quietly accept the advice and the word of government or industry. That is no longer good enough. In Tasmania, for example, we had the recent case of the drinking water contamination by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission and the use near Lorinna of the herbicide Atrazine. The people of Lorinna were told that the chemical Atrazine was quite safe, yet it is listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organisation as a category 2B carcinogen. Is that quite safe? We do not know. In other words, Atrazine is described as a substance for which there is sufficient evidence in animal tests, or degrees of evidence considered appropriate, to classify it by that body as a possible human carcinogen. In response to a question on notice, the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Atrazine is a residual herbicide with relative persistence . . . Atrazine is no longer approved for use in Sweden due to concerns over possible water contamination.</PARA>
<PARA>The central point is that it is not for government alone to be making assessments about the safety of a chemical and holding the information in secret files. People who will be affected ought to be able to gather information about, in this case, the toxicity of the stuff which ends up in drinking water. That right ought to exist and there is absolutely no excuse to withhold that right any longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed to tangible benefits that would result from full disclosure of information about chemical use in our society. Specifically, the United States experience is that its Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act 1986, which gives citizens access to information about corporate uses and emissions of toxic chemicals, has enabled chemical use to be reduced by up to 20 per cent compared with 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another piece of legislation is California's proposition 65. I am sure honourable senators will be aware of how California's legislation in the form of propositions comes to force. These are propositions which originate from the community. California's proposition 65 requires businesses to warn citizens beforehand if they may be exposed to a significant amount of a chemical known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. In addition, the burden of proof was reversed so that industry needed to be able to demonstrate that exposure to listed chemicals posed no significant risk. A very important aspect of that is well endorsed by the experience which has subsequently ensued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those legislative initiatives, emissions have decreased to the point where six listed chemicals are no longer emitted at all. A number of companies have made public commitments to reduce emissions. For example, the Monsanto Corporation has pledged to reduce by 90 per cent its worldwide toxic emissions. AT&amp;T of the United States has set a goal of eliminating toxic air emissions by the year 2000. I would suggest that a very important catalyst in bringing about these pledges by these companies has been the legislation that I have described so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is part of society and must be accountable to it. Full disclosure enables the public to better understand the effects of chemicals on health and the environment. Public exposure and involvement will enable better emergency planning and a greater ability to plan for potential disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coode Island disaster of 1991, for example, highlights the need for much better access to information on toxic chemicals. Indeed, the final report of the review panel recommended that legislation was needed to assist the public understanding of hazardous materials and production processes. Currently, the responsibility for planning for emergencies is entirely with government agencies. In the United States, the communities are involved in local emergency planning committees. Information on the location and nature of the storage of toxic chemicals is required by those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Canadian city of Vancouver, for example, has legislation which requires that when pesticides are applied to areas under its jurisdiction&mdash;including parks, schools, community centres and theatres, et cetera&mdash;signs which feature the well recognised skull and crossbones, the symbol of danger, have to be erected for a certain time. In Australia, nothing less should be acceptable. Residents surely have the right to be informed and, more importantly, warned about activities such as blackberry spraying and other weed control measures that are occurring in their neighbourhood if those activities are dangerous. How many councils in Australia actually do regard it as their obligation to signpost their spraying operations? I suggest that to do so would inevitably draw attention to another sort of pesticide poisoning, aerial spraying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of great concern is the composition of pesticides and, particularly, whether labelling is adequate. I am sure that many honourable senators will have been confronted by the sorts of labels that can be seen on pesticide cans. While the concentration of the active component is shown on those labels, little information is supplied about the other inert components in the mixtures. For example, some products contain toxic spectator compounds that function as solvents to be able to carry the active agents. They might carry wetting agents or dispersants to make the active ingredient work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Toxicology testing is conducted on the active ingredient rather than on the mixture as it is used in its application. In other words, when it is all mixed together, we really do not have a clue about the effect that it might have. Unfortunately, despite that, there is no evidence that industry is about to regulate itself towards recommending that toxicological testing be conducted on the actual mixture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also relevant to refer to the mixtures of different chemicals that are frequently used in agriculture and elsewhere. Often, two or more chemicals are either mixed for the purpose of application or applied in tandem, perhaps to save passing continuously by one form of equipment or to meet a seasonal requirement that it be done within a certain time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am continuously being asked by people to insist that government and industry start toxicity testing on the basis of real life situations&mdash;not laboratory testing but actually as things are applied. I have just mentioned that chemicals are used in tandem or in a mixture. These techniques are still being used without reference to tests that have been made regarding that sort of practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no longer good enough for us to be treating chemicals as single agents. They are not. More often, they are being used in conjunction with others, the combined result of which is simply not known. The cocktail effect often brings about the unknown symptoms which I have been at pains to provide this chamber with for so many months now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time has gone when our population can continue to be fobbed off on these issues. There is a real and increasing demand for information about the chemical wonders of our time. An increasing number of people are allergic to chemicals. There are people who are subjected to chemicals when they go about their business in our schools, parks and general homes. They are exposed to chemicals which are attached to food which has been produced or chemicals in places of entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the next time honourable senators board an aircraft they make sure it is not the one which has been sitting on the tarmac overnight, because one of the first things that is done before they sit down is the application of chemicals to the seats. If it contacts their skin and it is still in a strong concentration, they may suffer a reaction. Cleaning chemicals are normally supposed to dry off before people take their seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People going about their normal daily business are exposed in a number of ways. It may be that before honourable senators take their seats they have applied another chemical to their skin. That cocktail is unknown in its effect. We need to know much more about the chemicals to which we are exposed in going about our daily business. We all have the right to know the composition and the known and unknown effects of these new agents of our modern living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I would like to speak briefly on a matter in the history of Australia which has been subject to very long, and perhaps endless, debate. I refer to the events of 1975 that occurred in this place concerning the blocking of supply, as it was called, and the subsequent events which led to an election and a landslide victory for the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, during the debate on the urgency motion, Senator Loosley and I exchanged interjections. He raised the point that, following the 1993 election, the coalition had not accepted the people's voice and the defeat of that election. My interjection was that the Labor Party has never accepted the 1975 defeat and the people's voice then. It was good to see&mdash;it made my day&mdash;Senator Loosley's reaction to that comment because it really did symbolise the Labor Party's continual bitterness and its uncontrolled agitation about the events of 1975. It showed that Labor Party inability to hold back a swelling of anger. It was good to see that I hit the spot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley then accused the coalition of running the 1975 tactics in the Senate in this session of parliament. He said that we would disrupt the parliament in the same manner as the coalition opposition did in 1975. My reply to that was, `Absolutely'. Senator Loosley should not have been as surprised as he looked, because my views should not surprise him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a very keen student of politics in those days and attended many of the rallies that were held in the lead-up to the 1974 election and straight after the dismissal. Moreover, my views about the events of 1975 were put down in my maiden speech in this parliament on 21 September 1987. I will read a section of my maiden speech once again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stand by the powers of the Senate to review, pass or reject Supply or any such similar appropriation Bill as outlined in the context of section 53 of the Constitution. It is an authority given to the Senate in the Constitution under the democratic principle that a second House is needed to check, balance and review the conduct of the executive arm of government. This is common and fundamental to the past and continuing ideal of our Australian democratic system of government. I oppose such tired yet persistent attempts to reduce the important and traditional role of the Senate so clearly set down by our forefathers.</PARA>
<PARA>How similar are the events of today to those of 1975. Following the 1974 Labor election victory by the then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, the government immediately went into a spiral of chaos. The Whitlam government went into terminal decay immediately following the 1974 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, as then, the government is morally bankrupt in the eyes of the community. Now, as then, we have a Prime Minister who has been rolled by his cabinet and caucus as recently as today on important issues, such as budget matters, and national issues, such as Mabo. Senator Loosley and the other members of the government know that all too well. They can smell the events of 1975 encroaching upon them again&mdash;that spiralling decaying government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, the now honourable Prime Minister, Mr Keating, leaves parliament early. Gough Whitlam had no interest in economics. When the issues he was interested in were finished for the day, and the parliament probably got on to more important matters such as the economy, he would leave parliament. The present Prime Minister is not much different; he leaves early too. When matters that are of particular interest to him, such as the republic, are not being debated he can be found back at home away from the running of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difference between the then Prime Minister, Mr Gough Whitlam, and the now honourable Prime Minister, Mr Keating. Gough Whitlam based his political motivation on himself; Mr Gough Whitlam's role model was Mr Gough Whitlam. Unlike Mr Gough Whitlam, the now honourable Prime Minister, Mr Keating, as we all know, bases himself and his political background on Mr Jack Lang. This must be a case of history repeating itself. If one looks at the history of Jack Lang, one sees that he was one of the more ratty and madder politicians this country has seen. In the dying days of his political life he became a most bitter man and a nonsensical man. I think there are great parallels to be drawn there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Senate is not of the same makeup as it was in 1975&mdash;and nor is the Governor-General of the same ilk&mdash;there is no doubt that this government has the terminal decay smell of Mr Gough Whitlam's government. It is a regime that is now in a spiral to defeat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the remarks made tonight by my colleague Senator Watson about the untimely death of a very distinguished Tasmanian, a courageous Australian and fine member of the other place, Mr Charles William Jackson Falkinder CBE, DSO, DFC and Bar. As has been said earlier tonight by my colleague, Bill Falkinder was one of Australia's most decorated, if not the most decorated, bomber-navigator in the European theatre of World War II.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill would have been 72 years old yesterday. He was born in Hobart and, like many famous Tasmanians, he was educated at Hobart High School. In 1939, like a lot of young Australians, he joined the RAAF and was one of the first empire air scheme trainees to arrive in England. He went on to serve in the elite Pathfinder force of Bomber Command. He completed 107 sorties in heavy bombers and Mosquito aircraft. It is said that he was a navigator of great technical skill and efficiency, and that he had a great devotion to duty. He went on to become a wing commander. As Senator Watson said in his speech, because of his ability he was chosen to release the first bomb over Europe on D-day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our former colleague Bill Falkinder came to the other place in 1946 at the age of 25, and was at that time the youngest member of parliament. He was re-elected in 1949, 1951, 1954, 1955, 1958, 1961 and 1963. He retired in 1966 in frustration. A report of an interview he gave at the time stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">``Frustration had something to do with it,'' he says. ``There is a regrettable tendency for Parliament to be run by the executive''.</PARA>
<PARA>What has changed from that day to this? A more recent member for Franklin, Bruce Goodluck, also retired in frustration, I believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Franklin, Bill Falkinder represented my electorate. My family and I have lived there all our lives, and my family before me. As Senator Murphy knows, Tasmania is a small place when it comes to sorting out families and relationships. I must say that the late Bill Falkinder had more than a passing interest in my birthplace of South Arm. It seems that Bill's sister, Helen, was a land army girl who worked on a property next door belonging to my uncle. Also, before the war, Bill Falkinder spent many happy times at the residence of his sister, Mrs Drake, in a seaside cottage at South Arm less than half a mile from where I lived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After World War II South Arm was a favourite recreation area for more than one federal politician. I remember very well the late Sir Reginald Wright spending many a happy time at South Arm where he owned a seaside cottage. I can remember having a drink with him at the local RSL club. Likewise, the late Hon. Athol Townley, a former Minister for Defence, spent a fair amount of time at South Arm. Mr President, you may remember that this former Minister for Defence first ordered our F1-11 fighter bombers which are still looked upon as being one of our foremost defence aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Watson, I looked with particular interest at Bill Falkinder's maiden speech. I say this with no disrespect to my colleagues Senator Troeth and Senator Sandy Macdonald, but maiden speeches are often looked back on later in life and what one says in that first speech may come back to haunt one. Bill Falkinder made his first speech following debate on the budget of 1946-47. In those days, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Menzies, had moved by way of amendment that the first item be reduced by #1 as an instruction to the government. In other words, what was happening in the chamber in those days was very similar to what is happening here in the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Watson said, Bill Falkinder spoke about his electorate and about how the Labor government of the day was supporting an apple and pear acquisition scheme of some nine million bushels. I must say that the apple industry has reduced somewhat since then, but I am pleased to see that it is making a comeback. In those days #2 1/2 million was a direct capital investment into a scheme that acquired fruit and destroyed it to keep the industry going&mdash;things have changed somewhat since then&mdash;and it was a Labor government that was doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked back to see what happened before Mr Falkinder made his speech. Mr President, you will be pleased to know  that there was a certain Mr Harrison in the other place who would not withdraw a remark. As you would know, that Mr Harrison was the father of former Senator Shirley Walters. That is interesting&mdash;it must run in the family, as she would not withdraw. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr. HARRISON.</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I will not withdraw and apologize.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr. SPEAKER.</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I name the honourable member for Wentworth.</PARA>
<PARA>Then some young, new member for Richmond, I believe it was, a Country Party member in those days, Mr Anthony, interjected and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Name the Minister, too!</PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker turned around and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I warn the honourable member for Richmond (Mr. Anthony) that I shall name him if he disregards the authority of the Chair.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought things were much more quiet in those days. Mr Anthony said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have a go!</PARA>
<PARA>So he did. He named the honourable member for Richmond who retorted with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very impartial Speaker, a back-stabber!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, in those days as well, they were having trouble with the Speaker in the other place. Both of those opposition members were named and they departed from the chamber. I just wonder what was going through Bill Falkinder's mind when he had to follow on and make his first speech in that place. Obviously, Bill Falkinder did a very fine job for his electorate. He held a seat for 20 years. I doubt whether anybody else will ever do that&mdash;including Harry Quick&mdash;in the electorate of Franklin, because it is a changing area. He was very well respected by those people who I remember talking about him. He was obviously a very fine Australian, very courageous and successful, and one of the few bomber pilots who returned to Australia. I pass on my condolences to his family&mdash;his wife, Patricia, his daughter, Suzanne, his son, Christopher, and his grandchildren. I support the remarks made earlier by my colleague Senator Watson. </PARA>

I thought that the normal decencies are that, if one is are going to make accusations about a doctor, particularly accusations such as, `I do not think he is a person who should be practising medicine', it would be worth at least establishing the facts. Mr Knott thought so strongly of this point that he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is this doctor the sort of person who should even be practising medicine?</PARA>
<PARA>Let us deal with the facts. The facts are that Mr Knott has a personal friend who received an account from the doctor.

All this patient had to do was take the bill to the Medicare office, get a Medicare cheque and take it to the doctor in payment of the account. This patient was too indolent to do that.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that all four Anaesthetists rendering services in the Shoalhaven area have a computer linked system. All non payments are obvious and noted by all doctors concerned. Therefore, in order not to jeopardise receiving future treatment PLEASE PAY YOUR ACCOUNT PROMPTLY!! </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Knott says that there is an imputation there that no anaesthesia services would be provided to this recalcitrant patient if he did not pay his bill. Mr Knott goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I will progressively name the other three doctors, whether they are threatening this friend of mine with not receiving medical attention in an emergency?</PARA>
<PARA>There is no suggestion that in an emergency no service would be provided. But tell Mr Knott that, because he obviously does not understand. Not all medical services are emergency services; there is such a thing as discretionary surgery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these four anaesthetists operate out of one office. They are in a cooperative venture, sharing the same secretary, the same telephone and&mdash;shock, horror!&mdash;the same computer for their accounts. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage does Mr Knott seek to justify the failure of this man to pay the account after 2 3/4 years&mdash;if this is the patient that Mr Knott himself appears to have identified to the doctor.

<PARA>I ask Mr Knott why, over 2 3/4years, did this man not take one of the 10 bills he received along to the Medicare office, get a cheque and give it to the doctor?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do people think that they can with impunity avoid their own obligations?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like the federal police to look at whether or not these people are guilty of threatening my friend's life.</PARA>
<PARA>Great stuff for the local paper&mdash;because that is what it is all about. It is a desperate attempt by Mr Knott to show that he is in there fighting for the battlers who were foolish enough to elect him temporarily as the member for Gilmore. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are, penalising the victim. The victim is not the patient who got ten, `Get off your backside and give me the cheque', notes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the patient thought, `Oh dear, I won't go and get the Medicare cheque because he'll want the rest'. But at no stage did the patient communicate that he had any difficulty whatsoever in paying the bill. He certainly indicated that he had no difficulty in getting off his backside and going to the Medicare office to get the cheque. In fact, there was no contact whatsoever until just before Mr Knott raised this matter in parliament. The debt was magically paid one week before Mr Knott raised it in the parliament, but only to the extent of the Medicare cheque and not the balance. In other words, the doctor had to wait 2 3/4 years before something that ultimately cost the patient nothing, except a little energy, was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I ask of Mr Knott is that he do better and learn the responsibilities of being a member of parliament. If Dr Cole, for whom I have a high regard, is regarded by Mr Knott as not being a fit and proper person to be practising medicine, I could say that that is in itself a great commendation to Dr Cole. He must be good if Mr Knott denigrates him. I assure Dr Cole and any other medical practitioners who are subject to this kind of standover tactic that I will do all I can to ensure that the full story is told, and that no member of parliament&mdash;I use the phrase in a generic sense&mdash;should improperly blackguard decent, honourable members of the medical profession with impunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contributions tonight. One of the things that sticks in my mind is the thought of a young man, Bill Falkinder, arriving in this place in 1946, aged 25, having done, as both Senators Watson and Calvert said tonight, all those things for so many years and survived them. It is quite extraordinary. One would have thought he might have arrived here at age 40. To be 25 and having survived he must have brought an extraordinary history into this place. While I did not know Bill Falkinder, I certainly join with the sentiments of my colleagues opposite who have brought that to my attention and to the attention of Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it is important that we leap to those kinds of judgments from whichever side with caution. It is important that we are slow to judgment in these matters. If what he said is true about doctors collectively indicating that they would withhold service, I can certainly understand a concern on behalf of citizens but, as I say, I can only go on what he has said tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Members of the Ready Reserve are entitled to the benefits provided by the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (SRC Act 1988) if they suffer an injury arising out of, or in the course of, their Ready Reserve employment and that injury results in death, incapacity for work or impairment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For each of the first 45 weeks of incapacity following a compensable injury, a Ready Reservist would receive 100 percent of the pre&mdash;injury normal weekly earnings. Should resulting incapacity exceed 45 weeks, compensation payments would reduce to 75 per cent of normal weekly earnings for the duration of the incapacity until age 65 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All reasonable medical, hospital and treatment costs incurred as a consequence of the compensable condition would be covered under the SRC Act 1988 and a rehabilitation program, specifically designed to assist the injured member return to work, will be developed in consultation with the injured party and the treating health providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should a compensable injury result in permanent impairment, assessment of the extent of the functional impairment and related non economic loss would be undertaken and a lump sum award paid. Acceptance of the lump sum award would not disentitle the recipient from any of the other benefits available under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) If an aggravation of the injury occurs as a consequence of an incident in private employment, this would normally be considered a new injury. Compensation for the incapacity associated with that incident would be payable by the workers' compensation insurer of the private employer at the level provided for by the prevailing State or Territory workers' compensation legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) If the ex&mdash;Reservist joins the Australian Public Service, workers' compensation insurance would be provided by the SRC Act 1988 and an aggravation of a pre&mdash;existing injury by Commonwealth employment would be treated as a new and separate injury with compensation payable as detailed above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The difference between the levels of compensation payable in respect of an aggravation in private employment, or an aggravation in public service employment, is related to the level of benefit available under the workers' compensation legislation applicable to that employment. Should an ex&mdash;Reservist suffer an aggravation working for either a private employer, or the public service in an Australian State or Territory, the level of benefit payable is that provided for by the relevant State or Territory workers' compensation scheme. If the aggravation occurs during Commonwealth employment the applicable scheme would be the SRC Act 1988. This was acknowledged during the planning of the Ready Reserve concept.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The most recent report on superannuation liabilities in respect of the Commonwealth's civilian employees is entitled "Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme: A report on the long-term costs by the Australian Government Actuary&mdash;using data to 30 June 1988". This report was tabled in the House of Representatives on 14 May 1990 and in the Senate on 16 May 1990. It quantified the existing liability in respect of past service benefits in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) as an estimated $33 billion. The liability net of taxation and social security "clawback" was estimated at $18 billion. Since that time the Government has introduced the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS) which was expected to be a lower employer cost scheme.  The Australian Government Actuary will next review the superannuation liabilities under the PSS and CSS in 1993-94, based on data as at 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Some commentators have estimated that the Commonwealth's superannuation liabilities, including those for the military schemes, are currently around $40 billion. Based on the estimated past service liabilities for the CSS in the Australian Government Actuary's 1990 report and actuarial estimates of liabilities in respect of then current contributors to the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits scheme calculated in 1990, a $40 billion figure may be close to the mark. However, as noted in answer to Question 1 above, a reliable figure in respect of superannuation liabilities will not be available until the Australian Government Actuary completes the reviews of Commonwealth schemes that will be conducted in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In the report tabled in May 1990, the Australian Government Actuary projected estimated CSS costs as a percentage of salaries for superannuation purposes to the year 2050, the period over which the benefits were expected to be paid in respect of then existing contributors to the scheme. It is expected that the Australian Government Actuary's next report, covering both the PSS and the CSS, will project the estimated superannuation costs over a similar period in line with projected benefit payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Government Actuary performed reviews of the long term costs of the CSS as at 30 June 1982, 1985 and 1988. The report of </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">each review was tabled in the Parliament. With the concurrence of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the triennial review of the CSS which, if the PSS had not been introduced from 1 July 1990, would have been conducted as at 30 June 1991, was deferred to 1993-94 to allow adjustment of records in respect of transfers from the CSS to the PSS during 1990-91. In keeping with the past review cycle and, now, the Occupational Superannuation Standards, actuarial assessment of liabilities and costs will return to three-yearly intervals thereafter.  The Government's decision to introduce accrual based reporting for departments, announced by the Minister for Finance in November 1992, will provide for further comprehensive information to be reported to Parliament on superannuation liabilities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) 30 March 1989&mdash;This advice was provided by the Attorney-General's Department and concludes that unattached officers of the Australian Public Service are subject to disciplinary action under the Act;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) 4 July 1990&mdash;This advice was provided by the Department's Administrative Law Section. It concludes that officers of the Department who are appointed Heads of Mission are unattached officers for the duration of their appointment and can therefore be charged with misconduct under Section 63L of the Act;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) 10 December 1990&mdash;This advice was provided by the Department's Administrative Law Section. It considers the possible disciplining of Heads of Mission under Section 63J(2) of the Act, and concludes that, as unattached officers, Heads of Mission may be  disciplined for improper conduct under this Section;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iv) 20 December 1990&mdash;This advice was provided by the Department's Administrative Law Section. It concludes that HOMs are unattached officers and fall under the  discipline regime set out in Sections 63J and 63L of the Act. It also concludes that these provisions provide a separate disciplinary regime for unattached officers;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(v) 21 December 1990&mdash;This advice was provided by the Attorney-General's Department. It states that when an officer of the Australian Public Service is appointed as a Head of Mission that officer becomes unattached and is deemed to be on leave of absence without pay. Such officers may be charged with misconduct under Section 63L of the Act;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(vi) 28 April 1992&mdash;This advice was provided by the Australian Government Solicitor.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(vii) 23 November 1992&mdash;This advice was provided by Queens Counsel. It concludes that charges against an unattached officer under Section 63J must be disposed of before that officer is reattached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Only one unattached officer has been charged with misconduct under Part III of the Public Service Act for actions while serving as the head of an Australian diplomatic mission under appointment by the Executive Council.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, one former head of an Australian diplomatic mission has been charged with misconduct under Part III of the Act. Those charges were brought against the officer after he had been reattached but related to alleged misconduct while he had been head of mission and therefore unattached. The charges were dismissed by the Inquiry Officer largely on the facts of the case. Subsequent legal advice concerning an unrelated matter indicated, as noted in answer (1)(vii) above, that if charges are laid under Part III of the Act against an attached officer for misconduct while that officer was unattached there is a doubt whether those charges would stand.</PARA>

They travelled together and on one occasion only. They were accompanied to Santiago by an officer from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs; (c) the visit to Santiago was made from 18 April to 3 May 1991 and to Buenos Aires from 3 to 7 May 1991; (d) since the establishment in March 1989 of a discrete area within the Department dealing with fraud and discipline matters, there have been 180 separate investigations into allegations of misconduct, mal-administration or fraud, including the investigation into Mr Dan. Of that number, 77 of the investigations were in relation to allegations by the so-called "Officers Revolutionary Council".

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="605" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomsk-7 is a military nuclear reprocessing facility in Siberia, about 3000 km from Moscow and 230 km from the city of Novosibirsk. The accident occurred in facility N15 of the Tomsk chemical complex, some 115 km from the main Tomsk-7 installation and 28 km from the town of Tomsk. The immediately surrounding area is not densely populated. The accident occurred in an above ground section of the N15 facility, most of which is located underground. N15 is surrounded by a perimeter fence some 8 km from the plant. The accident referred to in your question occurred on 6 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific answers to the questions are:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The INES was developed jointly by the IAEA and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD to communicate promptly and consistently to the public the safety significance of reported events at nuclear installations. It classifies each event at one of seven levels&mdash;from a level 1 `anomaly', to a level 7 `major accident' with serious and widespread health and environmental effects. The INES is logarithmic, similar to the Richter scale for earthquakes. An increase in the INES from one level to the next represents an increase of approximately ten times in severity. Thus the Chernobyl accident, at level 7, was at least 10,000 times greater in severity than a Tomsk-like level 3 event. Level 3 is the lowest level event involving an off-site release of radioactivity above authorised limits. It corresponds to the most exposed person off-site receiving a dose of radiation of the order of tenths of a millisievert. Such a dose is about one tenth of the annual dose typically received from natural background radiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. It is possible that more detailed analysis of an event may result in its initially assessed INES level being raised or lowered. This has not occurred with the Tomsk explosion. The event was investigated by two special commissions, one from the State Committee for Emergency Situations and the other from the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy. Their findings were later corroborated by an international observer team invited to the site. The international team reported that, although the facility was extensively damaged by the explosion, the radiological effects appear to have been minimal. The total release of radioactivity at Tomsk is estimated to have been about 40 Curies, which is about one millionth of the Chernobyl release. A subsequent independent analysis by Russia's Kurchatov Institute confirmed that the explosion had limited radiological impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The available information suggests that Tomsk-7 is a military reprocessing plant using the `Purex' process to extract plutonium from irradiated uranium. Irradiated uranium fuel is first cut into pieces and the uranium dissolved in nitric acid. The early stages in the process separate most of the radioactive fission products from the uranium using an organic solvent. The explosion is believed to have occurred at a later stage, when nitric acid is added to a uranium nitrate-organic complex, in solution. It is understood that a release of gases in this stage, believed to be due to insufficient stirring of the solution, ruptured the tank holding the material and caused an electrical short circuit which lead to a fire and the explosion. The accident has been attributed to human error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Not according to the reports made available to me. Early media reports quoted the emergency committee as saying the wind had blown the radiation away from the plant to the north east. Media reports of a `radioactive cloud' attributed the details to Russian television or `local officials'. The international observer team noted that the wind was light and that it was snowing at the time of the accident, which may have helped limit the spread of the material released. Available information suggests that much less than 10 tonnes of material were released, mostly within the plant boundary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) No. The IAEA conducts safety inspections of civil nuclear facilities at the invitation of member states. As military-related applications were conducted at the Tomsk site, the IAEA was never invited to conduct a safety inspection there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am advised that the IAEA had no prior knowledge of safety systems at Tomsk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) ANSTO has no direct knowledge of the Tomsk-7 military site.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) No invitation to inspect the site has been issued to the IAEA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Variations of the Purex solvent-extraction process are used in all the plants. The explosion which occurred on 26 September 1973 at the B204 head end plant at the Windscale reprocessing plant in the UK took place at the initial stage in reprocessing and involved the fission products and the solvent. The radioactivity released was confined within the building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Australian Government's 1985 approval in principle for the return of 450 spent fuel elements from ANSTO's HIFAR research reactor to the US remains in force. Subject to further environmental assessments, the US Department of Energy expects to reactivate its policy of receiving foreign research reactor fuel for storage and eventual disposal in the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) I understand that Tomsk was one of the sites listed for the disposal of plutonium from warheads dismantled under the START treaties and protocols and I am not aware of any decision to remove the site from the list. The only actions of the Tomsk regional Parliament of which I am aware are its appeal to the Russian Supreme Soviet on 17 April 1993 for 210 billion roubles (about $250 million) to deal with the consequences of the incident, and its appeal to the Presidium of the Russian Supreme Soviet that the site be placed under local rather than federal control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Australian media reports of the Tomsk accident appear to have been generally responsible. Their early reporting of the accident as a level 3 event on the INES has not needed to be modified.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) There is a standard level of staffing for various program streams and the ABC emphasises that approximately 75% of Radio National's staff work across many programs, more than one ABC Radio network and frequently ABC Television as well:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more difficult to provide specific staffing levels for radio documentaries, since the ABC buys a percentage from the independent sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Radio Drama production is complex because of the use of independent writers, directors and actors. But a team of 6 to 7 producers sustains more than two hours of drama per week.</PARA>
