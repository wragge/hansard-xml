<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has recently  come to our attention that the United Nations Declaration of the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief has been declared to be an International Instrument for the purpose of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of great concern that this Declaration of the United Nations has been adopted by the Executive of the Parliament for we Australians as a policy, and has committed us as a nation to pursue in legislation (Article 7) the principles set out in the Declaration.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ordinance amends provisions in five laws that have been applied to the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Land Act 1933 (WA)(CKI) is amended by the addition of ss.176, 177 and 179 providing for the creation of easements for public amenities, the dedication of streets and the acceptance of plans of survey respectively. The Explanatory Statement contains no explanation of the effect, if any, of these provisions on the rights of private land owners or lessees in the Territory. For instance, the creation of an easement by s.176 could reduce the value of a parcel of land. The Committee has asked for an assurance that the operation of the ordinance will not prejudice land owners or that appropriate compensation is being arranged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN WOOL CORPORATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1992 No. 4382 WOOL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1992 No. 443</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These regulations change the voting majorities for motions relating to wool tax recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one case a one third vote was required and in another a two thirds vote was required. They both now require a vote of `more than half'. The Explanatory Statements do not provide reasons for these changes. The Committee has asked for an assurance that the rights of wool-tax payers will not be prejudiced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1993 No. 5</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations prescribe procedures to be taken in relation to notices and reports of accidents and for review by the AAT of decisions of returning officers concerning elections of health and safety representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 37G provides that an employer must retain a record of a report of an accident or dangerous occurrence for 30 years. The Committee has asked for advice on the reasons for this lengthy period.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In new ss.108(2) (voting paper spoilt), 111(3) (vote of person not on roll), 115(3) (casting of early vote), 122(4) (casting of postal vote), and 133(3) and (4) (rejection of ballot papers), the presiding officer, electoral officer or returning officer has to be satisfied of various matters set out in the sections. Some of these issues may require an on-the-spot resolution. However, there is no indication of what would happen if a person is not satisfied with the official's decision. The Committee has asked for further advice on whether a person is able to seek a review of such decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">IMPORTATION OF ARMS, AMMUNITION AND EXPLOSIVES ORDINANCE 1992 TERRITORY OF COCOS (KEELING) ISLANDS ORDINANCE No. 6 OF 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ordinance regulates the importation of arms, ammunition and explosives into the Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commencement clause provides for the ordinance to take effect on the gazettal of a notice by the Minister. This is a departure from the usual practice where, if there is no fixed date, there will be automatic commencement after a set period, normally six months. No explanation has been given in the Explanatory Statement for this departure from current practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 8, 11 and 12 respectively confer discretions on the Commissioner to grant or refuse a permit, to vary a permit and to revoke or suspend a permit. Sections 8 and 12 provide only for subjective criteria to control this power; section 11 provides no criteria at all. Sections 8 and 12 provide for an appeal to the Minister against an adverse decision, but there appears to be no such appeal from a s.11 decision. Section 13 provides that the Minister's decision on appeals is final. In addition, there does not appear to be an appeal from a decision under s.14 to refuse to grant a temporary import permit or to grant such a permit subject to unacceptable conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 27 confers wide powers of delegation on the Commissioner, who may delegate all of his or her powers to any person at all. Furthermore, any person to whom the Commissioner delegates a power may, in turn, subdelegate the power to any person at all. These powers of delegation and subdelegation are unusual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 24 provides that unless seized firearms are returned within 60 days, they must be taken to court to be dealt with according to law. This appears to be a long period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has asked the Minister for further advice.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATUTORY RULES 1992 No. 454</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations provide for the payment of AUSTUDY and ABSTUDY Supplement allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 14 provides that where an application has been lodged late but a student has taken `all reasonable steps' and has been `prevented from lodging the application. . . because of circumstances beyond his or her control' the lateness will, in effect, be overlooked. The Committee has asked for advice on who will make these decisions or whether there is independent review of the merits of an unfavourable decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PUBLIC SERVICE DETERMINATION 1992/333</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determination provides for the payment of a disability allowance for officers of the Industry Commission who are required to relocate from Canberra to Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3.1(2) appears to confer a discretion on the Chairperson of the Commission to increase or decrease the amount of these allowances. The Committee is concerned about whether it is appropriate to confer an apparent power to reduce allowances. The Committee appreciates that persons who disagree with the exercise of the discretion may approach the Merit Protection and Review Agency. However, the Committee questions any need at all for a discretion to reduce allowances. The Committee is also concerned at the apparent possibility of prejudicial retrospective exercise of the discretion. The Committee has asked for further advice and an assurance that no one has been prejudiced by the operation of this discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) REGULATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATUTORY RULES 1993 No. 52</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations prescribe matters relating to the administration of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations provide for a number of discretions. For instance, r.8(2) provides that a statement must specify matters in sufficient detail, while r.11 provides that a payment must not be made unless sufficient information is reasonably available. There do not appear to be any provisions as to who will decide whether matters or information is sufficient or reasonably available. There is a direct discretion r.8(3) to exempt certain statements from being endorsed, signed, dated and numbered. Finally, r.10(8) provides for an effective exemption of up to 10 years from an offence provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is also concerned at several provisions which may be unfair. First, r.10(9) provides that an employee will lose an entitlement if certain action is not taken within 10 years. Secondly, r.12(2) provides that allowances are not payable to a person attending before the Commissioner in the capacity of employer, employee or person representing an employer. This suggests that a person representing an employee will be paid an allowance while a person representing an employer will not be paid. Thirdly, r.13(1) provides that an employer must notify the Commissioner within one month of a change of address of the employer or an employee. However, r.13(2) then provides that if notification is not given within the month, then the old address is deemed to be the address for the purposes of the regulations. This could disadvantage an employee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has asked for further advice on whether the discretions, the adverse exercise of which could have important consequences, are subject to review of their merits by the AAT; and the effect of provisions which may disadvantage individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STATEMENT BY CHAIRMAN</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised the usual large numbers of disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate. This legislation was made under the authority of scores of parent Acts administered through virtually all Departments of State.  Almost every legislative scheme relies on delegated legislation to provide the administrative details of programs set out in broad policy in parent Acts which authorise such delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they conform to the high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties which the Senate applies to Acts.  If the Committee detects any breach of these standards it writes to the Minister or other law-maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided.  If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument.  This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument.  However, this ultimate step is rarely necessary, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Normally by the end of a sittings Ministers would have given the Committee undertakings to amend dozens of provisions in different instruments or parent Acts to meet its concerns.  However, the 13 March 1993 election resulted in the Senate meeting later than usual.  Nevertheless, even at this early stage of its scrutiny the Committee can report the usual high level of cooperation from Ministers in its non-partisan operations.  The Committee is grateful for this cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 674 instruments, which is an historically high number, even considering the interruption to normal public administration caused by the election.  Of these, 166 were statutory rules, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series of delegated legislation.  The other 508 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the 674 instruments were scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders. There were 76 prima facie defects or matters worthy of comment in those 674 instruments.  The defects are described below under each of the four principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle, together with principle (d), includes every aspect of parliamentary propriety.  Therefore, it is not merely a narrow check on legal validity.  Nevertheless, the first requirement under this principle is that an instrument should not, on its face, be technically defective.  In this context, one provision of an instrument was made under section 4 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which provides that delegated legislation may be made under provisions of Acts which have not yet commenced.  However, the relevant provision in the instrument appeared to commence before the enabling provision of the parent Act, which would result in invalidity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated legislation should effect an intention evident from the face of an instrument or advised by the Explanatory Statement.  In one case, the Explanatory Statement advised that it was intended to provide for specified matters by orders, which were disallowable.  However, the instrument provided for the matters by directions, which were not disallowable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Acts Interpretation Act limits the type of material which may be incorporated in delegated legislation.  One instrument may have incorporated a statutory list, which could have breached the requirement that such incorporation not include material as amended from time to time.  In this context, the Committee continued its scrutiny of the validity of instruments which provided for certain Commonwealth employees overseas to be paid under foreign laws, as amended from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Acts Interpretation Act also provides that delegated legislation must not operate retrospectively, unless no person is prejudiced apart from the Commonwealth.  Here, several instruments commenced retrospectively with no advice in the Explanatory Statement that the retrospectivity was beneficial. In at least one case the retrospectivity appeared able to operate prejudicially.  The Committee also questions long periods of retrospectivity, or unusual retrospectivity, even where it is valid.  For instance, one amending instrument amended the commencement of the principal instrument to operate retrospectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if delegated legislation provides for powers to be delegated to inappropriate persons.  In one case both the Minister and the Secretary could delegate all of their substantial and sensitive powers to any person at all.  In another case, an official could delegate all of his or her powers to any person at all, who in term could subdelegate those powers to any person.  Finally, one amending instrument amended the principal instrument to restrict the class of persons to whom a power could be delegated.  This implemented an undertaking given to the Committee and the role of the Committee was acknowledged in the Explanatory Statement.  However, another amending instrument, made on the same day, amended another provision of the same principal instrument to provide for the original wide delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated legislation often provides for further legislation to be made. As well as questions of validity, it is a breach of parliamentary propriety if this further legislation is not subject to appropriate scrutiny by tabling and possible disallowance.  Some instruments which were clearly legislative were not even subject to gazettal, much less to tabling and disallowance.  Others were subject only to gazettal.  One instrument provided for similar legislative powers to be exercised by both orders, which were disallowable, and by directions, which were not.  Another provided for legislative directions, with no apparent power to do so.  Numbers of mandatory forms were not subject to any form of scrutiny.  Some of these legislative powers dealt with sensitive matters.  For instance, agreements which provided for the supply of personal information were subject only to gazettal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if changes in taxes, levies, charges and fees are not explained in the Explanatory Statement.  One instrument increased and reduced different levies and changed the dates upon which they were to be paid.  Another increased some levies by up to 60%, reduced others (the Explanatory Statement advised that two reductions of 17.5% were reductions of "about 25%"), added new levies and removed others.  Another imposed charges of $1,020, $2,040 or $4,080, on items which appeared similar, with supplementary charges in some cases double that for others.  None of these changes were explained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be a breach of parliamentary propriety if the drafting, presentation and access of delegated legislation is of a lower standard than that of Acts. One instrument purported to contain a schedule, but the putative schedule was not headed as such.  In another, substantial powers were given to authorised persons, but there was no provision for their appointment.  One provision had no verb, while others contained errors of citation and reference.  Another instrument was so complex that the Committee suggested a reprint.  Another provided only for "his", instead of the now usual "his or her".  Another instrument provided for "persons connected with a corporation", without defining such persons.  Another provided for an archaic commencement by the Minister giving notice in the Gazette, instead of a mandatory date or set period for commencement.  Others included vague and subjective expressions which were not defined, such as, "will benefit the Australian economy", "consistent with the interests of Australia", and "children suffer persecution or abuse of human rights".  Often these expressions were drafted as if they were objective criteria, rather than matters of possible dispute which would have to be settled.  Some of these expressions, which really require the exercise of a discretion, included "all reasonable steps" and "circumstances beyond his or her control".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a lighter note, one instrument provided that a requirement to provide an address in Perth could be satisfied by providing an address in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, while another referred to a "statuary" authority, which may have been accurate but which was certainly unintended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle in a broad and expanding fashion to ensure that delegated legislation does not operate adversely on any aspect of personal rights or liberties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of instruments may have affected the right to carry on a trade or profession.  One instrument changed the voting procedures at an annual general meeting of primary producers, which may have affected the interests of those producers.  Another provided that the authorities may keep seized goods for 60 days before they are dealt with by a court.  Another appeared to prejudice the rights of property owners, without providing for compensation.  Another provided that in certain cases a person was ineligible to hold a licence for five years.  One instrument provided for a search warrant which did not include the usual provision that only reasonable force could be used to enter a building.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One instrument imposed heavy obligations on persons acting as sponsors for others or giving assurances of support for those persons.  These included responsibility for all financial obligations entered into by the person sponsored, and for compliance by that person with all industrial legislation and awards.  There were other onerous liabilities relating to repayment of job search and new start allowances and special benefits.  These obligations may also have operated retrospectively, with certain of them deemed to be debts due and payable to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another instrument provided that the Minister may authorise the use of certain personal information for law enforcement, national security, taxation, customs and other purposes.  This provision had implications for the privacy of the persons affected.  Another instrument reviewed, for the first time in five years, an allowance payable to certain Commonwealth employees in a foreign country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (c)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many instruments of delegated legislation grant discretions to Ministers or other public officials.  Such discretions should be drafted as narrowly as possible, include objective criteria to guide and limit the exercise of the discretion, and provide an appropriate right of review of the merits of a decision to an external, independent tribunal, which would usually be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one case, the Committee asked the Minister for the policy upon which review rights were based.  In this case, the Committee also questioned the seniority of departmental officers who were responsible for internal review of decisions.  In another case, an instrument described a discretion as an "absolute discretion", which included subjective criteria subject to the opinion of the decision maker.  Another instrument granted discretions to State Ministers.  Another instrument provided that some discretions must be exercised by the Minister or the secretary respectively, acting personally, but that many others could be widely delegated, with no apparent provision for review.  Other instruments provided for discretions which were drafted as if they were objective criteria, with no indication even of who was to exercise them.  In one case, an instrument providing expressly for review of other discretions itself provided for unreviewable discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is particularly vigilant where the exercise of a discretion may affect a person's right to earn a livelihood.  For instance, one instrument provided for discretions affecting endorsements on a pilot's licence, and another for suspension of that licence.  Another provided for discretions affecting appointment as government inspectors.  Another dealt with medical examinations, the result of which determined whether a person could continue to work in a particular field.  One discretion gave an official power to reduce a statutory allowance payable to specified Commonwealth employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many discretions have commercial and financial implications.  The Committee ensures that these are subject to appropriate review.  In several cases the discretion to grant a licence was subject to AAT review, but the imposition of conditions on the licence was not.  In another case the grant of a licence was reviewable but a discretion to vary a licence was not.  In another the grant of a licence was reviewable but the grant of a temporary licence was not.  One instrument provided for AAT review for some matters but not for others and for review by the Minister for some matters but not for others.  One instrument provided for a fee of $7,500 and a concessional fee of $1,500, with no indication of review of a decision to charge the full fee.  Another discretion was to decide whether a building or proposed buildings were hazardous.  There was another discretion to exempt persons completely from compliance with the principal instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other discretions affected persons in the exercise of their personal rights, such as voting in local government elections, continuing to live in Australia and being admitted to a private hospital at largely government expense.</PARA>

On 18 and 19 May 1993 Senators Bishop, Colston, Loosley, O'Chee, Patterson and Zakharov were appointed to the Committee.  This was the same membership as the previous Committee.  At the first meeting of the Committee on 20 May 1993, Senator Loosley was elected Chairman, in accordance with S.O.23(7).  The Chairman then appointed Senator Bishop as Deputy Chairman, in accordance with S.O.23(8).  Senators Loosley and Bishop were respectively the previous Chairman and Deputy Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee continued its practice of meeting with other people and bodies concerned with delegated legislation.  During these sittings it met with Dr Susan Kenny, the new President of the Administrative Review Council; with Ms Jean Baker, head of the Office of Legislative Drafting, and two of her Branch heads; and with members and staff of the Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee of the Parliament of Victoria.  The Committee secretary also met with a Branch head of the Department of Industrial Relations about an undertaking given to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee tabled two Reports, the Ninety-Fourth Report, the Annual Report for 1991-92; and the Ninety-Fifth Report, a Report on scrutiny by the Committee of instruments made in the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee made two special statements to the Senate.  One brought the Senate up to date with developments analysed in the Ninety-First Report, dealing with delegated legislation providing for superannuation for Commonwealth employees.  The second statement advised of developments since the Ninety-Third Report, which dealt with regulations imposing United Nations sanctions.  That statement noted that both the second reading speech and the Explanatory Memorandum for the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill 1993 referred with approval to the Ninety-Third Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful for the support which it has received from all Senators during the past sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Statement on regulations imposing United Nations sanctions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 16 December 1992 the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances tabled its Ninety-Third Report, a Report on scrutiny by the Committee of regulations imposing United Nations sanctions.  That Report examined 19 sets of regulations which effected Australia's implementation of United Nations sanctions against Iraq, Kuwait, Libya and Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee reported on a number of aspects of the regulations.  These included concerns about personal rights affected by the sanctions, including the right to travel and to carry on a business, and the right to have adverse decisions of public officials reviewed by an independent tribunal.  The Committee was anxious to ensure that delegated legislation imposing sanctions did not operate harshly or unfairly, or was subject to unreviewable arbitrary decisions by officials.  After correspondence with Ministers the Committee was reassured on these points.  This was largely because the sanctions were integrated into existing administrative and legislative structures with which the Committee was familiar.  Indeed, a number of existing review provisions had been included at its suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee also considered whether the details of sanctions were so sensitive or important that they should have been provided for in a Bill, which would be subject to all the safeguards and rigours of parliamentary passage.  Here also, the Committee concluded that the regulations did not breach its high standards of parliamentary propriety.  The reason for this was the uncommon nature of the power under which the regulations were made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This power was derived not from express provisions of a parent Act, under which delegated legislation provides administrative or technical details of a scheme established by that Act.  Instead, the regulations implemented general obligations imposed on Australia by international law.  In virtually all cases, the power to make delegated legislation is set out clearly in an Act. Indeed, in the absence of clear and express power in a parent Act the Committee would question the validity of an instrument.  However, in the present case the Committee accepted the advice in the good quality Explanatory Statements which accompanied each of the 19 sets of regulations which implemented sanctions, that Australia was obliged to comply with Security Council resolutions. Therefore, the question of parliamentary enactment did not arise.  The regulations filled in the details of existing legal duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances the Committee endorsed the use of regulations rather than an Act to carry out Australia's legal obligations.  In fact, the use of delegated legislation even appeared preferable to that of an Act.  For instance, the regulations merely provided administrative details of an existing legal framework, which was a classic example of the appropriate use of delegated legislation.  Also, the nature of Australia's obligations required a quick and flexible legislative response, which was also a classic role of delegated legislation.  In this context, sanctions could not only be imposed more quickly by regulation, but also the fine details could be amended more quickly than by Act.  Finally, the Committee was advised that Australia's obligation to comply with United Nations sanctions was mandatory.  In these circumstances, regulations appeared more suitable than an Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was in the context of the Ninety-Third Report that the Committee noted the introduction in the Senate on 6 May 1993 of the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill 1993, sponsored by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon Gareth Evans.  This Bill proposed amendments of the principal Act to provide for regulations to implement Australia's obligations under the United Nations Charter more comprehensively than was possible under existing legislation.  The Minister advised the Senate that strict new sanctions against Yugoslavia required by Security Council Resolution 820 of 17 April 1993 could not at present be implemented.  For instance, it was not possible to freeze funds held in Australia by companies based in Yugoslavia.  The Minister advised that the central provision in the Bill was to provide for regulations which were necessary or convenient to apply measures adopted by the Security Council.  While outlining this central part of the Bill, the Minister referred in a positive way to the Ninety-Third Report of the Committee.  The Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill also favourably mentioned the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister further advised that the new legislation would supplement, rather than replace, the existing regulations.  Also, any regulations made under the proposed Act would be subject to the usual parliamentary scrutiny, including possible disallowance.  Persons aggrieved by a decision to make particular regulations could claim that their making was neither necessary nor convenient to apply measures adopted by the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This statement of the Minister about regulations being necessary and convenient neatly expressed a fundamental requirement of delegated legislation, which is that it should be in accordance with the parent Act. Also, the power to make regulations which is expressly provided in principal Acts is almost invariably drafted as prescribing all matters required or permitted by the Act to be prescribed, or necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to the Act.  However, it has been unusual for delegated legislation to be declared or acknowledged to be invalid because it is neither necessary nor convenient.  Also, the present Bill does not expressly provide for regulations to be necessary or convenient. Nevertheless, the Committee regards the statement, repeated in the Explanatory Memorandum, as expressing the legal position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides almost entirely for the power to make regulations and with associated matters.  The importance of its subject matter for Australia's international relations, together with the effect it will have on personal lives, emphasises the indispensable place of delegated legislation in the Commonwealth legislative system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Statement on delegated legislation providing superannuation for Commonwealth employees</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24 June 1992 the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances tabled its Ninety-First Report, a Report on scrutiny by the Committee of delegated legislation made under Acts providing superannuation for Commonwealth employees.  That Report examined delegated legislation made to effect the operation of the new scheme of Commonwealth superannuation, introduced on 1 July 1990.  The Report noted that in the 18 months after that date executive law makers made 105 different legislative instruments in 29 separate series under the parent Acts which established the new scheme and continued the existing scheme.  The theme of the Report was the diversity and volume of these instruments and the importance of delegated legislation in contemporary Australian public administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this statement is to bring the Report up to date and to examine further the theme of diversity and volume, from a perspective of 12 months after the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted in the Report, the new scheme operated through the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990.  All of these Acts provided for delegated legislation, as did the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990, which amended the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988, and two minor Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1992 all of these Acts, apart from the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990, were amended.  The Superannuation Act 1976 was amended by four separate Acts.  However, only the Superannuation Amendment Act 1992 directly provided for additional delegated legislation.  Some of these provisions were unusual.  For instance, new s.155C(2) of the Superannuation Act 1976 provided:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(2) If regulations made for the purposes of subsection (1) are inconsistent with a provision of this Act, the regulations prevail and that provision, to the extent of the inconsistency, is of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, new ss.110SC and 110SD provided for specified disallowable determinations to be statutory rules for the purposes of the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903.  These are beneficial provisions which will ensure high standards of presentation and access for such determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as being amended by the four Acts, the Superannuation Act 1976 was also modified by nine separate sets of regulations amending seven separate principal regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 amendments of the other three Acts, the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988, the Superannuation Act 1990 and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990, did not directly provide for delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high volume of delegated legislation made under these Acts in the 18 months between 1 July 1990 and 31 December 1991 was continued during calendar year 1992.  In those 12 months the Governor-General and the Minister made 77 separate instruments under the four Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Superannuation Act 1976 the Governor-General and the Minister made 47 disallowable legislative instruments, of which 29 were statutory rules in 13 separate series.  Of these 29 statutory rules, 21 were sets of regulations, seven were determinations and one was a declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 the Minister made seven statutory rules in three separate series, all of which were declarations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Superannuation Act 1990 the Minister made nine statutory rules in three separate series, all of which were declarations.  The Minister also made two amending deeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990 the Minister made 12 determinations, in one series, none of which were statutory rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, of the 77 instruments made under the four parent Acts in 1992, 45 were made as statutory rules and, of these, 21 were made as regulations. The other eight statutory rules included seven determinations and one declaration.  The 45 statutory rules were made in 19 separate series.  The 32 instruments not made as statutory rules were made in five separate series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Report the Committee emphasised the volume and diversity of instruments made to effect the new scheme.  This volume and diversity continued throughout 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The volume of delegated legislation made in 1992 was even higher, on a proportionate basis, than it was in 1990 and 1991.  The result was that in the first two and half years of the new superannuation scheme, from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1992, executive law makers made 182 separate disallowable instruments, or more than one for each week of that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The diversity of the delegated legislation is obvious from the earlier descriptions in this statement.  For instance, as noted earlier, the 45 instruments made as statutory rules included 19 separate series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Report the Committee reported that the legislative instruments required to operate this one new program illustrated the importance of delegated legislation.  The numbers and types of this legislation were an example of the flexibility available to the executive to fill in the administrative details of a scheme established by statute.  The Committee also reported that this was an example of the appropriate use of delegated legislation, providing for large numbers of administrative changes over a period.  It seemed clear that the scheme could not have been brought into operation as effectively without this legislative option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delegated legislation made in the 12 months after the Report confirmed and reinforced these conclusions.  The Committee scrutinised all this additional legislation, concluding that it did not breach its high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal rights.  The Committee believes that its Ninety-First Report, together with this statement, is an instructive case study of the appropriate and necessary use of delegated legislation as one of the most important and effective techniques of contempory Commonwealth public administration.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is simple. It proposes to reverse the previous decision of the Senate to pass the Tax Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. That bill, which I described at the time as probably the worse piece of legislation ever presented by the Govt, was passed into law in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister devised a simple, yet totally irresponsible, strategy of matching the promises of the Opposition without funding them. We had the absurd growth "projections" of the One Nation statement&mdash;which were immediately ridiculed and are now totally discredited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These predicted that unemployment would have decreased to 8%, that $8 billion in personal tax cuts would be provided and the budget deficit would be eliminated by 1995/96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What in fact happened was that unemployment went up and the budget deficit also increased. The Treasurer scaled down the growth estimates to more realistic levels and the deficit pledge was replaced by a new target which was to reduce the deficit to about $4 or $5 billion by 1996/97. Again this is ambitious, but it is more realistic than the original forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the budget was not politically successful for the Govt, real doubt was thrown upon the deliverability of the income tax cuts. Instead of letting the issue fade away, Prime Minister Keating decided that he would prove that the income tax cuts were deliverable by legislating for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A bill was duly passed by the House of Representatives and then sent to the Senate. The bill's second reading was voted against by the Democrats and only passed because the Opposition supported the Govt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I referred the matter to the Finance and Public Adminstration Committee for examination. A number of witnesses appeared from the financial sector, academia, the church, the welfare sector, and the media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All witnesses criticised the tax cuts as either being unaffordable and hence irresponsible, or regressive and unfair. Many thought both. There was even the threat of a Labor member of the Committee voting with his conscience and recommending that the cuts not be proceeded with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet despite this overwhelming evidence that the proposal was against the national interest, the Opposition voted for the measure in this Chamber. I question in particular the wisdom of the National Party in this regard. There has been an unprecedented rural crisis in Australia for the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite literally farmers have been forced to walk off their land, to shoot their livestock, to be crushed by high interest rates, and to suffer the tragedy of drought. Quite literally rural Australia has been going broke over the past few years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of this, almost nobody on the land has to worry about income tax because they don't have any income. Indeed one Qld grazier told me recently that for the first time in his life he wished he had a tax problem!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Diverting billions of dollars per year that we don't have, to pay income tax cuts is necessarily going to mean that rural Australians are going to be eligible for less assistance and will have to pay more indirect tax&mdash;yet they won't get a tax cut because their incomes have collapsed.  Do the Nationals really care about the bush? If so why are they supporting a measure which will not benefit those who really need it?</PARA>

<PARA>  Cols 1-3 are as published by the Govt. Col 4 has estimated nominal income after 3 years inflation at 3.5 per cent. Columns 7 and 8 show the real tax cuts (or increases) in $ terms and as a % of income. Assume rate of inflation 3.5 per cent over 3 years. Column 9 takes account of the effects of an extra $2bn in revenue raised from tighter compliance measures and is assumed to act as a proportional tax at a rate of 1 per cent of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the evidence is clear that the effect of the proposals is regressive. As Dr Quiggan stated ". . . the effect of the changes will be to reduce post-tax disposable income for everybody with current dollar incomes below about $25,000 a year and to increase incomes for everybody with incomes above that figure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is evidence which proves that the tax cuts are deliberately designed to redistribute income from those less well off to those who are well off&mdash;literally the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current taxation statistics show that 46% of all taxpayers earn less than $21,000 and hence will not receive any benefit from the tax cuts.  This includes over 1.6 million men and over 2 million, that is almost 60%, of women. So the One Nation tax cuts don't go to almost half of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To rub salt into the wounds the tax cuts then increase in value as income rises. It would be bad enough if there were a flat rate tax cut for everyone earning over $20,700, but to actually increase the tax benefit as income rises is outrageous. Were the ACTU or anybody else to propose that wage rises be structured in this manner, they would be ridiculed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the tax cuts had been proposed by the Coalition, the howls of outrage from the Labor Party would have been deafening&mdash;and they would have been justified. Unfortunately there is only one person in the Govt with the conscience to speak the truth about this proposal&mdash;that is Senator Walsh.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Senators would be aware of this week's "Cassandra" column concerning the trend in personal income taxation. It was a damning indictment of the Govt's tax rate policy&mdash;not their tax policy overall which is generally good&mdash;but in particular the practice of Mr Keating to concentrate on cutting tax rates as opposed to indexing the thresholds at which the various marginal tax rates commence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The motivation of the Govt is very transparent&mdash;it wishes to give the appearance of reducing burdens by reducing rates&mdash;however the effect of this strategy is ridiculously unfair. This policy gives the largest tax cuts to those on very high incomes and it drags into the tax net those people with very low incomes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What this shows it that the real effect of Labor's reform of the income tax rates has been a disgracefully regressive redistribution of income from the lower and middle income groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following trends are undeniable from this data</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*The value of the tax free threshold is being progressively reduced thereby dragging more and more very low income earners into the tax net. It is estimated that about 320,000 taxpayers have been brought into the tax net during the last 10 years;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those on very high incomes&mdash;about $120,000&mdash;are paying over $8,000 less tax per year than before Labor came to office; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those on extremely high incomes&mdash;about $240,000&mdash;are paying about $24,000 less tax per year than before Labor came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the record on increasing the fairness of the system is very good&mdash;this has been totally overwhelmed by the disgraceful reduction in progressivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we check this against the Labor Party Platform we find that Item 51 of the platform states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The continued existence of large disparities of income and wealth means that an increase in the effective progression of the tax/transfer system should remain a major policy goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, Mr President, the One Nation tax cuts are in contravention of this item as they reduce the progressivity of the tax/transfer system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another flaw with the tax cuts are their macro-economic effect. Suddenly the Govt has acknowledged that there is a crisis in the savings rate. They chose to completely deregulate the financial sector and ever since then the savings rate has plummeted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now the Govt is concerned about savings. It has commissioned Vince Fitzgerald to report on the issue. The tax cuts are going to reduce public sector savings by about $8 billion per year. In the process they will probably also increase the level of interest rates as the financing demands of the public sector start to crowd out private investment. What will be the result?&mdash;higher interest rates and higher foreign debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as I have demonstated there is a multitude of reasons why this bill should receive the support of the Senate. This bill has no precedent in the Senate&mdash;there has never been a need for such a measure before. This Govt,(and Mr Keating in particular), built its reputation on fiscal competence. The tax cuts have forever destroyed that reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no precedent for a non-Govt party ever trying to make the income tax rates system fairer by introducing legislation into the Senate. We have moved amendments to that effect although we have never received the support of either of the major Parties, but this bill is unique.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditional political wisdom is that it is impossible to oppose tax cuts even if they are unfair and unaffordable. At a time when the country is suffering massive unemployment, when we are trying to remove the terrible weight of the recession and rebuild the nation, it is time that the traditional wisdom was questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not saying that there should be a massive increase in taxation. We are not saying that there will never be times when tax cuts are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, we are saying that the tax cuts are an unfair extravagance which cannot be afforded over the next few years. Surely the priority of the Govt and the Parliament is to assist those without a job to find a job, not to buy the support of those fortunate enough to have a job?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these tax cuts really are affordable, as asserted, then the vast amounts of money involved should be redirected to give people jobs, to increase the attractiveness of private investment, to fund the abolition of payroll tax, to introduce a home childcare allowance which will be at a meaningful level to allow parents to choose to work at home or in the conventional workforce, to build a truly world class national railway system, to end the double taxation of interest which has so damaged savings in this country, to clean up our degraded rivers etc. There are virtually limitless ways that these resources could be equitably and productively deployed. We should use this opportunity to advance the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also wish to address a potential red herring before it emerges in this debate. Under the Constitution, the Senate has differing powers to the House of Representatives. Bills which impose taxation may only be introduced into the House of Reps. This bill will not do that even though it will reverse future tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A bill imposing taxation is a particular creature. It is not any bill relating to taxation, it is a very select few bills which are very short. The Income Tax Act 1986 is a bill imposing taxation, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which is now many thousands of pages thick is not a bill which imposes tax and similarly the Income Tax Rates Act is not a bill which imposes taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event Odgers confirms that, even if a bill were to fall foul of the Constitution on a technicality, the Courts accept it as a valid law anyway because it has been passed by both Houses of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So this measure has the potential to fix the huge budgetary problems of this decade in a fair, progressive, non-inflationary way. We are attempting to move above traditional politics and pointscoring to get agreement in the national interest on addressing the twin crises of a huge budget deficit and large scale long term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is deliberately entitled "fiscal responsibility". This is something that is in short supply in this nation at the moment. This area has not been a long suit for the Democrats according to some. This matter sets the record straight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will vote against the suspension of Standing Orders. It is a technique that we all use from time to time to press a political point, and Senator Kernot has done that. For days, she has been advertising her position through the media. Coming in here and seeking to suspend Standing Orders is an opportunity for her to get five minutes to do it again. But we know that she does not seriously expect that, on the last day of the sitting, with the volume of work before this chamber, it is possible to have a full and proper debate on the merits of the matter. That is why she does not expect us to support the suspension, and we will not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make just two points, which I hope are within Standing Orders, in relation to her proposal. In some ways it is not surprising, because the Australian Democrats are the high tax party. The Australian Democrats are continually calling for more tax&mdash;increases in taxes and new taxes. In fact, in the Australian Democrats' draft Budget I think they were advocating a further $7 billion in new taxes. That was Senator Spindler's alternative Budget, if I remember correctly. For example, the Australian Democrats are advocating increased taxes on fuel, new wealth taxes. So we should not be surprised by the position being adopted to the sentiment of wanting to see taxes increase rather than decrease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a different point of view. We believe that high taxes are a disincentive to growth and employment. That is why we were strongly advocating a reduction of taxes in this country. Furthermore, we demonstrated how that could be funded and how it could be done responsibly. Nevertheless, the Australian people did not support us in that, and that is now history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point in relation to Senator Kernot's proposal is that it is astonishing that the party that claims to be here to keep the bastards honest, to keep the government of the day honest, comes in here in the first sitting session and says, `We now want to support you in being dishonest in breaking the promises that you just took to the Australian people'. We find that astonishing. We find it astonishing that the Democrats say to the Australian Government immediately after the election, `If you break the pledge that you gave to the Australian people during the election, we will support you. In fact, we urge you to break that pledge, and we will even bring it to the Senate to help you to break that pledge'. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is to be the new role of the Australian Democrats we find it astonishing, because that means that they no longer have any interest at all in keeping the Government honest. The whole of the Chipp legacy has been lost. Therefore, we wonder what is to be the new role of the Australian Democrats in this place. Anyway, that is all by the way and I must concede it has been testing the tolerance of the chamber a little. The real point is that there is not time to properly deal with this matter today. Therefore, we will have to oppose the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This, indeed, is a very urgent matter. As Senator Kernot has pointed out, the Government is already in the process of framing its Budget. It is doing that against a background of massive and still increasing unemployment, of failure to address the important industrial development issues of this country. There were two notices of motion this morning from the Opposition supporting the Auditor-General in his trenchant criticism of the Government. The dissimulation of the Opposition is absolutely incredible in that it can go on with this duplicity as it has done this morning. It is indeed an urgent matter, and I pick up on a couple of the points which Senator Ray made. This is not a Bill which would impose taxation. This is a Bill which deals with a Bill which imposed, in itself, removal of taxation. So it does not fall within those provisions of the Constitution which make it illegal for such a Bill to originate in the Senate. So much for Senator Ray's remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to what Senator Hill has said, it is absolutely clear on all the records that Australia is a low tax country. Compared with all the OECD countries, only Turkey has a lower rate of tax. For Senator Hill to be arguing that we need to reduce taxation to make this country work better is nonsense. It flies in the face of all the evidence. Most of the other OECD countries are doing better than Australia with much higher levels of taxation. So the logic simply does not lie on the side of Senator Hill. In relation to his other argument about keeping the bastards honest, if this Government were to pass legislation, or to promise to pass legislation, which we believed was not in the best interests of this country, we have a responsibility to vote against that&mdash;</PARA>

We believe that at this time it is morally indefensible to be giving tax cuts and cutting out so many important government services. We have a mandate from those people who voted for us and that is the view we are expressing in this place. We have a responsibility to put that point of view. It is rather interesting that when Bill Clinton specifically went against the same sorts of promises he made in his presidential election campaign, he has been praised, not only by most of the American economic writers but also by most of the Australian economic writers, for specifically rejecting the tax cuts and moving to address the very severe economic problems that that country also has.

<PARA>This is an issue that Senator Kernot has brought out very convincingly in a whole series of questions in the last couple of weeks in this chamber. Keeping the bastards honest means addressing the important issues which this country faces, and it also means keeping the Government on track in addressing those issues. It does not mean slavishly falling in line with promises that we believe would be disastrous for this country; would damage this country still further; and would not address the very serious problems of industrial reconstruction and massive unemployment. We believe that this matter is an urgent matter. We believe that the Bill should be dealt with immediately and should be passed by this chamber forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes amendments to a number of Acts within the Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services portfolio. The amendments are largely of a minor procedural nature and are aimed at rectifying a number of drafting anomalies which have arisen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of this Bill contains a measure making it an offence to furnish false or misleading information in support of applications for certain approvals under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954, as well as in support of submissions which may be made contesting an intent to revoke certain approvals. Generally, these applications relate to Commonwealth financial assistance, while the submissions relate to the proposed revocation of a person's approval as a suitable person to operate a service in receipt of Commonwealth subsidy. As a deterrent, the measure also provides a substantial penalty for the offence. Until now, there have been no specific offences or penalties under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 and reliance has been placed on the general offences under the Crimes Act 1914. The possible application of the general offences in the Crimes Act 1914 relating to providing false or misleading information to obtain a `benefit' to applications and submissions under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 has been called into question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 provides that it is a condition of receipt of recurrent funding that an organisation operating, or intending to operate a hostel, must be approved as an approved operator. Such approval is granted only where, on the basis of information provided by way of application to the Minister, the Minister is satisfied that an applicant is suitable to be an operator of hostels. The Department relies heavily on the accuracy of information provided to the Minister and to other Departmental decision makers to ensure the integrity of decisions in relation to matters of eligibility, relative merit and the suitability of persons to provide quality, efficient and compassionate care to frail aged people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposed amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 removes any doubts over whether the provision of false and misleading information in applications and submissions made under the Act are criminal offences. This measure aims to deter that minority element whose actions to date do not demonstrate a commitment to these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 of the Bill corrects two drafting errors in the National Health Act 1953 that were introduced by the passage of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment (No.2) Act 1992. The first amendment relates to the placing of section 99AB in the appropriate Division of Part VII of the National Health Act. Section 99AB relates to the payment of advances for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. It should be located in Division 3 of the Act. At the present time it is inappropriately located in Division 4 of the Act which relates to members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment relates to the replacing of the term `in-patient' which previously existed in the National Health Act with the term `person'. This was achieved by the passage of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment (No.2) Act 1992. The replacement of the term `in-patient' with the term `person' in paragraph (da) of the definition of `basic private table' or `basic table' in subsection 4(1) of the Act resulted in an amendment having been made which referred to a term that had not been introduced into the Act at the time that the amendment came into effect. To overcome this problem a further amendment was required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the Bill amends the Health, Housing and Community Services Legislation Amendment Act 1992. That Act introduced some consequential amendments to the provisions of the National Health Act 1953 relating to the changed title of members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the qualifications of persons who could be appointed as the chairperson of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal. The proposed amendment makes it clear that the chairperson of the Pharmaceutical Remuneration Tribunal is to be either a senior deputy president or a deputy president of the Australian Industrial Relations Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of the Bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973. The amendments in this part correct anomalies arising from the passage of the Health Insurance (Pathology) Amendment Act (No.2) 1991. These amendments are of a minor technical nature and do not have any substantive affect. Clause 16 of the Bill does, however, create an exception to the secrecy provision contained in section 130 of the Health Insurance Act 1973.  Departmental officers frequently receive requests for information relating to public and private hospitals in Australia. The details which are often sought include the name and address of the hospitals, their bed capacities, the nature of the medical services provided, etc.. Most information acquired in the performance of duties under the Health Insurance Act is protected from disclosure by the secrecy provision. This results in an absurdity arising in the situation where the `protected' information is already legitimately out in the public domain. In the present situation the names and addresses of hospitals are to be found in telephone directories. To have a restriction on the ability of officers to disclose such information which is of assistance to members of the public appears to be absurd. Similarly to restrict officers from providing details such as the number of beds available in a hospital the kinds of services provided, etc., appears to serve no valid purpose as such information is already in the public domain from other sources. The proposed amendment is intended to make it clear that an `authorised officer' is able to release such information to members of the public on request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 6 of the Bill amends the National Health Act 1953 by renumbering several provisions and removing references to repealed and redundant provisions. The Bill also contains a measure which provides that records which are required to be kept under section 61 of the National Health Act 1953 to enable claims for Commonwealth benefit to be verified, must be kept for seven years. There has, until this amendment, been no time limit on the keeping of such records by proprietors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Claims for benefit are verified by examination of nursing home records by teams of Commonwealth officers. With expenditure of all nursing homes for each financial year from 1986/87 onwards subject to validation and acquittal, Government resource constraints will mean that it may be some time before a nursing home's expenditure in relation to a given financial year is able to be validated. Because of this delay, the necessary records are often found to be incomplete or missing altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment introduces a statutory minimum retention period of seven years, which is equivalent to the period for which corporate records are required to be kept under taxation law, commencing from the end of the financial year to which the records relate. Currently, whilst the Act broadly provides that records must be kept to enable verification of claims, this amendment will make this requirement explicit while limiting the time within which the Commonwealth must satisfy itself of a claim and take any necessary acquittal action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BOUNTY (SHIPS) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes amendments to the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989 which implement the Government's election commitment announced by the Prime Minister on 24 February 1993 to extend the ship building bounty in line with general manufacturing tariffs, so that it is progressively reduced from the current 10% to 5% by July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments replace the existing bounty rates with the new rates for the period 1993-94 to 1996-97. The proposed new rates correspond with the tariff reductions set down in the Government's statement "Building a Competitive Australia" of 12 March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than the more rapid phase down and termination of the bounty by 1 July 1995 set down in the current Act, the new rates proposed are 9% for 1993-94, 8% for 1994-95, 7% for 1995-96 and 5% for 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision on bounty rates was made after consultation between the Government and the Australian Shipbuilders' Association. Further issues raised by the Association relating to the administration of the scheme, including the provisions to apply at the end of the scheme and the future of the scheme beyond July 1997, will also be considered by this Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The shipbuilding industry has changed from a dying industry in the 1970's when the industry was characterised by industrial unrest, high levels of government support and traditional production of conventional ships for what was then a declining world market, to one of Australia's manufacturing successes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now Australian builders are leading their competitors in the fast ferry sector and luxury yachts, but the rest of the world is catching up fast.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantial progress toward becoming a viable, export-orientated manufacturing sector has been made despite the reducing levels of bounty. Now the industry is a multi-million dollar export earner specialising in innovative products for niche markets. Some are already recognised as world leaders due to their approach to design and product technology. Shipbuilders now are concentrating on vessels such as passenger and vehicular ferries, luxury motor yachts, offshore supply vessels, tugs and small trading vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the problems that could result from premature phasing out of assistance and proposes to extend the bounty in line with general manufacturing tariffs. The more gradual reduction in the bounty rate will sustain the competitive gains made by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The period of the new bounty regime promises years of strong export growth coupled with increased employment as the industry gears up to meet international competition. To maintain a leading position builders have to continue to produce world beating designs and technology in new sectors. This will present major challenges in re-equipping to build bigger ships, in financing larger orders and in funding bigger operations generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given their success so far, we believe shipbuilders deserve at least the same support from Government that other Australian manufacturers get while they tackle these challenges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ARTS, ENVIRONMENT AND TERRITORIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of the Arts, Environment and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is to make various minor improvements to the ACT self-government legislation, which are the result of a review of the legislation conducted by the ACT administration and my department in 1992, three years after self-government. Possible more important changes are being examined and would be included in a separate Bill at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill removes from the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 limitations on the powers of the Legislative Assembly and the executive of the Territory that are no longer considered appropriate. For example, the assembly will be given power to decide the number of its members; how frequently it will meet; how laws passed by it will be notified to the public; and the level of remuneration of its members and the Ministers and senior officers of the ACT Government. This brings the ACT's degree of self-government closer to that of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">amends the ACT self-government legislation to ensure that, during the transitional period before the ACT establishes its own public service, the Commonwealth's COMCARE system applies to the ACT fire brigade and to Legislative Assembly members' staff, as well as other ACT Government employees.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends 4 Acts administered within the Transport and Communications portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the amendments are of a technical nature and represent a fine tuning and clarification of provisions. The amendments do not introduce substantial new policy schemes. I will refer in turn to each of the Acts being amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 will insert a new subsection 92(1A) into the Act which will allow Australia Post to operate a national change of address scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are proposed following concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances that exemptions to the secrecy provisions under regulation 20 of the Australian Postal Corporation Regulations be included in primary legislation rather than delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will enable a customer's name and address to be disclosed where the customer consents in writing to the disclosure of their new address to a person or organisation or class of organisation covered by the customer's consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post is subject to the Information Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988. Accordingly any information obtained by Australia Post as a consequence of the scheme must be handled in accordance with Information Privacy Principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Breaches of the disclosure provisions will be subject to section 70 of the Crimes Act 1914, that imposes a penalty of up to two years imprisonment for Australia Post employees or contractors who breach their duty not to disclose information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of information disclosure for law enforcement purposes is being undertaken in consultation with Federal, State and Territory agencies. It is proposed, subject to the Government's overall legislative priorities, to bring forward further amendments to section 92 in the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Motor Vehicle Standards Act will correct some minor drafting errors in relation to the term "road vehicle". As well, in accordance with recent amendments to the Crimes Act, all monetary penalties will be expressed in terms of penalty units. One penalty unit is currently valued at $100. Future amendments of the Crimes Act will increase the value of a penalty unit so that the penalties will reflect variations in current money values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Motor Vehicle Standards Act is also being amended to provide for a penalty where conditions to import a nonstandard vehicle are breached. Typical conditions which may be determined by the Minister are, in the case of a vehicle imported for wrecking, that the vehicle will be dismantled or, in the case of a vehicle that is to be used for transport in Australia, that the vehicle will be made standard before it is supplied to the market.</PARA>

The amendments are to correct a number of minor errors, such as typographical errors and incorrect references, in the 1992 Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Food Labelling Bill 1993 is a Private Senator's Bill introduced with a very simple aim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is to make it quick and easy for consumers to identify the country of origin of any food product, and, in particular, to identify whether that food is genuinely a product of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the legislation the terms `Australian Made' and `Made in Australia' are banned from use for food products and the definition of Product of Australia is tightened dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foods cannot be labelled as `Product of Australia' unless:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)all of the ingredients of the food are grown or produced in Australia; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)ingredients of the food that make up at least 90 per cent by volume of the food are grown or produced in Australia and the remaining ingredients are commercially unavailable foods; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)all of the steps that have gone into making up the food have occurred wholly within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(`commercially unavailable foods' means foods that are prescribed, being foods that are not able to be made in Australia in commercially available quantities.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of Australian symbols&mdash;such as a map of Australia, a kangaroo or the flag&mdash;is restricted to foods which meet the new product of Australia definition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms Made in Australia and Australian Made are deliberately banned&mdash;for food&mdash;because I believe they have become so devalued they are now in effect meaningless. Consumers have no confidence in their integrity at all. We need a fresh start and they should go. I have no problem with the use of `Processed in Australia', because that gives a clear indication of exactly what has taken place here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes compulsory a Table of Product Contents, detailing each ingredient, its percentage by volume in the product and its country of origin, in letters at least 4mm high (example below).</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Content        % by volume in product    Country of origin</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Apricots                 70%                 Australia</PARA>
<PARA>Water                    20%                 Australia</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Made optional under the legislation are the use of three new categories of food&mdash;`A', `B' and`C'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A category `A' food is one which meets the new Product of Australia definition and which is produced by an Australian citizen, partnership or company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foods meeting category `A' requirements can be labelled with the letter `A', `Category A Food', `100% Australian' or the expression `Processed and packaged in Australia, from Australian materials by Australians (or by an Australian company)'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A category `B' food is one which meets the new Product of Australia definition and which is produced by a person, partnership or company who or which is not Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Category `B' foods can be labelled with the letter `B', `Category B Food' or the expression `Processed and packaged in Australia, from Australian materials by a [country of control] company'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A category `C' food is one in which the ingredients are at least 50 per cent by volume grown or produced in Australia and which is processed and packaged in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Category `C' foods can be labelled with the letter `C', `category C Food' or `Processed and packaged in Australia, from more than 50% Australian materials'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `A', `B' and `C' categorisation scheme is the one I used in my food labelling trials with the Foodland supermarket group in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that both Category A and Category B foods can be `Product of Australia'. The distinction is with the nationality of company control. It is also important to note that their use is optional, so producers can judge for themselves whether they wish to provide ownership information to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats, unlike the Government, believe the issue of ownership is important, and, indeed, that there is a demand from the public for information regarding ownership. The popularity of the AusBuy Guide published by the Australian Owned Companies Association and the outcry over the sale of Arnotts are an indication of that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a brief outline of the Bill. I now turn to why it is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think it is too far off the mark to suggest this Bill is needed because our current labelling laws are a shambles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The example I like to use is coffee. Everybody knows we produce very little coffee in this country. We produce it in `boutique' quantities at best.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet you can walk into the supermarket and pick up a 250 gram jar of Nescafe or International Roast, and the label says Product of Australia. How is this so? Because the coffee beans go through their final processing stage here. This product should be labelled `Processed in Australia'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all know almost intuitively that this is not a product of Australia, and we tend to laugh it off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But apply the same logic to a can of tomato soup or a jar of jam. They are labelled Product of Australia, and we assume the contents are made from Australian tomatoes or Australian fruits or berries. Yet in exactly the same way that coffee can be labelled Product of Australia, so could soup or jam made from overseas sourced tomatoes, fruits or berries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People do not laugh at that. They believe&mdash;and they have every right to believe&mdash;that in those cases Product of Australia means just that&mdash;that the contents are Australian. Australian grown and Australian processed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slackness of the current laws misleads consumers, disadvantages Australian businesses and costs this country jobs and our companies profits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is wide public acknowledgment that that is the case. There is also wide public demand for genuine, easy to understand country of origin labelling. You only have to walk down any supermarket aisle in the country and you will see shoppers reading boxes and cans trying to discern exactly where a product is from.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And they have very little confidence in the current system. That is why we need a completely new broom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surveys also show us that where there is a choice and prices are similar, people will buy Australian. Eighty-eight percent of respondents to a Morgan Gallup poll in July 1991 indicated they thought people should buy Australian in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem for that 88 per cent of the population is in identifying Australian products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that two of the largest supermarket chains in the nation, Coles and Woolworths, decided last year to implement their own costly Australian product identification schemes indicates clearly a public demand for such information. Their need to do it indicates the current poor state of our labelling laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The products and Australian producers affected by our current labelling shambles are extensive. Peanuts, orange juice, apple juice, fish and pork are well known examples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vegetable and food imports increased by $86 million or some 22 per cent ($382 million to $469 million) in the year from June 1991 to June 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imports of meat and meat preparations rose 14 per cent to $42 million; fish imports rose $30 million to $474 million; orange juice imports soared from $9 million to $23 million; apple juice from $5 million to $13 million; and frozen vegetables recorded an increase in imports of almost 30  per cent to $24 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Grocery imports are reported to have increased by 21 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in the September and December quarters of 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of questions surrounding these dramatic increases. Tariff levels, dumping, foreign subsidies, quotas and simply genuine price competition are all issues connected to those figures. I do not want to enter into those issues here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question I wish to raise is how much of that increase is because consumers simply cannot tell from the labels what is Australian and what is not? I do not know, but the point remains&mdash;how many of us can make the choice to genuinely buy Australian if we want to?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A study by the Printing and Allied Trades Employers' Federation of Australia suggests the Australian printing, packaging and labelling industry is losing some $50 million every year as a result of poor, misleading or non-existent country of origin information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They consider the wider Australian economy is losing some $500 million from the problem. That translates to some 500 jobs in the printing, packaging and labelling industry alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe proper labelling can aid us to create jobs and curb our food import bill. It is not&mdash;as some would have us believe&mdash;a protectionist device. In fact, the economic purists should love it because it helps fulfil one of the conditions of a perfectly functioning free market&mdash;perfect information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The more information consumers have the better they can make rational judgments and genuine&mdash;not imperfect&mdash;`market' outcomes will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I mentioned earlier, the Democrats consider the issue of ownership is also important, in both philosophical and practical economic terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have noted the concerns of groups such as the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia (GMA) who believe it is `inappropriate and confusing to consumers to differentiate between products on the basis of ownership'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GMA of course represents the Australian arms of several enormous multi-national food corporations who may&mdash;if consumers decide&mdash;stand to lose from accurate labelling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Minister for Consumer Affairs, Ms Jeannette McHugh, has also suggested ownership is irrelevant. She suggests the AusBuy Guide&mdash;which outlines ownership alone&mdash;threatens Australian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have taken on board those concerns and made the provision of ownership information optional. The provision of such information in our scheme is not in isolation. It is in conjunction with accurate country of origin labelling, which the GMA supports. Companies which want to provide ownership information can. Consumers can then decide whether it is important to them or not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe the issue of ownership is important in economic terms. We do not oppose foreign investment, as long as it has demonstrable benefits for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where foreign investment represents new business or guarantees improvements or expansion in existing businesses, fair enough. We need capital. However, in the five years to June 1991 only 13.4 per cent of the $120 billion of foreign investment approved by the Foreign Investment Review Board was for new business. The remaining 86.6 per cent&mdash;or $103.7 billion&mdash;was to take over existing business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has increased our national expenditure on interest and dividends and contributed not insubstantially to our continuing current account deficit. Profits which previously remained in Australia now go overseas. In the five years to June 1991 $88.25 billion was paid out in interest and dividends (versus $20 billion coming in). Whether the benefits of investment match the net flow out is, I believe, questionable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where foreign investment represents acquisitions of existing businesses, there must be stringent tests of provable net benefit applied. If the Foreign Investment Review Board and the Government will not do that, then perhaps consumers will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But all that is an aside to this Bill. Once again, we are merely providing companies with the opportunity to inform consumers, who can then do with that information what they will.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to close by briefly outlining the history of our involvement with this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Food labelling is an issue which has been of personal interest to me for many years, firstly as a mother, and then as someone made personally aware of the problems being faced by vegetable producers around Mount Gambier, where I lived for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats first outlined an alternative scheme&mdash;the A-B-C scheme&mdash;in our Getting To Work document in July 1992. It received some media coverage and the public reaction to the idea was extraordinarily positive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Managing Director of the independent South Australian supermarket group Foodland, Mr Paul Pilkington, heard me talking about the idea on the ABC's Adelaide Drive-time show, hosted by Murray Nichol, and suggested Foodland stores run a trial of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following that was a period of exhaustive research, as my three electorate staff contacted Foodland's 400 suppliers seeking details of product content and ownership for some 16,000 product lines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were then contacted by a South Australian company, Fasson Australia, which offered to donate label material (Fasnature Recycled) and a Western Australian printing company, Supa Stik Labels and Labelling Systems, which offered to print the trial labels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By October we had enough information to get up and running (despite a lack of co-operation from GMA members) and on October 27 we launched a trial of the A-B-C labelling scheme in seven Foodland supermarkets in Adelaide, placing coloured labels on the shelves next to the price tags.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The feedback we got back from shoppers was again extremely positive. Many people wanted to know why it had never been done before, and many more suggested the information should appear on product packaging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those comments were the inspiration for this Bill. In December last year I tabled a draft Food Labelling Bill for public comment, and now, six months later, in May 1993, introduce a final version.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tabling of this Bill is timely, given the release earlier this week of the Report of the Working Groups on Country of Origin Labelling of Consumer Products. The working groups were established by the Government last year at least in part, I would suggest, in response to the attention the Democrats were receiving for our proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that the working groups apparently sent their research questionnaire to Foodland, and not to other, larger supermarket chains, tends to confirm this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope the tabling of this Bill at this time will continue to concentrate the mind of the Government on the need for action. The options outlined in the working parties' report include a `do nothing' option. That would be entirely unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One criticism I have received is that this Bill relates to food labelling only. Indeed I recognise the problems in other areas such as clothing and textiles. With the limited resources available to me it has been very much a matter of taking things one step at a time. If the government continues to prevaricate, non-food products will be next.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the meantime this Bill represents a further push for the government, to make sure we do achieve real change in food labelling&mdash;people want it, people need it, and, one way or another, the Democrats will ensure they get it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

I asked whether a submission had been received from a conservation group. The Parliamentary Secretary asked me to advise the name of the conservation group, which I had but which I did not read at the time. It is the Central Queensland Wildlife Protection Society. Press reports suggest that it is asking the Government for a $50,000 grant to make a submission to this inquiry, for which the Government has set aside $500,000. I ask again: has any application been received from the Central Queensland Wildlife Protection Society? If it has been received, what is the fate of the application? What parameters does the Government adopt in handing out taxpayers' money for people to make submissions? If it has not yet been made, what basis would the Government use to determine whether that grant is likely to be made?</PARA></TALK.START>

One is related to the continued operations of the airline from Perth to both Cocos and Christmas islands, on which I received a lengthy answer which set out the financial arrangements for this year and the subsidy arrangements that applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, I received from the Department of Transport and Communications an answer to a question at this committee which related to the contemplation of international air travel carriers operating to and from Christmas Island and the need for the agreements and arrangements that would be put in place. That answer refers particularly to the approval that has been given to PT Sempati Air to operate services from Indonesia to Christmas Island, but at this stage, the answer implies, the airline has not advised a start-up date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that it is now indicated that the casino is to commence operation on 8 August of this year, I would have thought that there would be in some way a coordinating committee or some tourist promotional arrangement being coordinated by this department to ensure that the operation of air services from Australia to the island at the same time as this important casino will start and the operation of the Sempati Air facilities to the island were coordinated. I am keen to establish that the department is facilitating this and is ensuring that air services, both international and domestic, will be sufficiently coordinated to ensure that there is no initial frustration once the casino starts operation in August. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sempati airline is a private organisation which does have direct contact with the developers of the casino on Christmas Island. The Government has not played any role in coordinating the links between Sempati airline&mdash;the private airline&mdash;and the developers. Presumably there are some ongoing discussions or arrangements with them, but the Government is not involved directly with that in any way. The Government is involved, however, in conjunction with the local council on Christmas Island, in seeking the development of domestic airline carriers from Australia to fly to Christmas Island. It is involved in attempting to establish those sorts of links with the island from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would merely reiterate and stress my concerns that this is a matter that needs very delicate and careful coordination. There will be the establishment of a $50 to $60 million casino, principally to serve the Indonesian market or the Asian market. From the discussions I have had with the developing company and with officials, both on the island and with the department here, I gather that the casino will be primarily dedicated to high-flying gamblers and to that special market of people that probably go in for a weekend with more than $100,000 in their pocket. Nevertheless, I would not want to see the Government in an embarrassing situation later this year because these air services have not been properly coordinated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the answer I received from the Department of Transport and Communications merely indicated that Sempati Air had been granted approval, although it had not advised a start-up date. Further on, the answer states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process has generated interest amongst a number of the bidding airlines to consider operating beyond Christmas Island to other international destinations.</PARA>
<PARA>So I would hope that we would see a situation in the future where this department and the Department of Transport and Communications and, I would hope, the Government's new initiatives for tourism would also be very carefully coordinated in this regard. Otherwise, we are going to see the establishment of a very specialist casino stuck out on an island in the Indian Ocean and principally serving only people who cannot gamble in Indonesia for legal reasons of the Indonesian regime. Our island of Christmas Island will be used as a safety valve, if you like, for the gambling community of Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I appreciate that we will pick up the royalty income that will naturally flow from the operation of the casino on Christmas Island. There have been indications in previous estimates and forward estimates that this is going to be considerable. Probably something in the order of $10 million or more per year will flow through to the revenue of the Commonwealth, which, of course, can then be used to offset the other services for the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government has announced a very extensive rebuilding and construction program for Christmas Island over the next five years which exceeds $40 million. I would want to see that reciprocal benefit of the income flowing from the operation of the casino in order to fund the rebuilding and development projects on Christmas Island, otherwise the liability is going to fall totally onto the Australian taxpayer to provide these benefits on Christmas Island for a very small community of 1,300 people. They certainly need the services, I appreciate that; but unless the tourism projects are properly coordinated we could end up with a very great embarrassment on our hands, particularly given the nature of Asian politics and Asian gambling. </PARA>

So I do have some constituency concern&mdash;that those people can travel, on a reasonable basis, from Christmas Island back to the mainland of Australia. The current arrangement between Perth and Christmas Island is a charter arrangement. As I have said, the department is concerned to have an appropriately scheduled domestic airline flying to and from Christmas Island. In terms of the points made about the revenue flow and about the current arrangement being used largely by Indonesians, I certainly appreciate that. But it is not a dissimilar situation, frankly, from the Tasmanian casino in its early days when it drew a very large part of its revenue from Victorians; there was a transfer of income from Victoria to Tasmania. I have to say, from a Tasmanian perspective, that we very much appreciate it. But that is changing somewhat with the opening of casinos, so we appreciate the honourable senator's concerns.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My other reservation concerns housing policy on Christmas Island. Again, I thank the Minister and the department for the extensive reply that I received to a question on notice relating to the details of the expenditure proposed as part of the rebuilding program for the housing policy that has been announced. With the anticipated changes in tourism development on the island, I believe that the housing situation on Christmas Island will undergo extreme pressures in the next 12 months or so. This will be inevitable with the large number of staff that will be required for the casino and also for the construction program generally. I am a bit concerned that the forward estimates relating specifically to housing may not meet the current need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also aware that there is an ongoing dispute between the Federal Government and the union of Christmas Island workers with regard to the provision of housing. This has blown up in the Asian press because many of the island residents' home communities are either in Singapore or in Malaysia. Officials of the union of Christmas Island workers have been reported in both the Singaporean and Malaysian media as implying that the Federal Government's initiatives with regard to housing are a form of racism. I am concerned that that sort of media criticism damages Australia's reputation and may be out of proportion to the extent of the problem. I draw to the Government's attention the concerns of island residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue with regard to housing is that a number of island residents have been unable to purchase the accommodation which they presently occupy. I am aware that there are disputes on the island in this regard. In particular, I refer to the dispute that has been ongoing with the former Minister, Ms Fatin, and correspondence to the current Minister, Mrs Kelly, from Mrs Patricia Power and Dr Holger Rumpff of Christmas Island, which would indicate that there has been a degree of lack of resolution by the Minister in being involved in trying to determine equity and fairness between island residents, yet recognising the needs of people on that community. Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that these matters have been drawn to Mrs Kelly's personal attention? Is it intended to seek early resolution so this will not result in extensive court actions and appeals&mdash;apparent at present&mdash;which will obviously be very costly to the department?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During 1988, 1989 and 1990, loans and subsidies were paid by this Government to a company called Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd, which at the time was the owner of the sawmill at Ravenshoe. This total loan and subsidy of some $7.59 million was part of a structural adjustment package to that company as a result of the World Heritage listing of the wet tropics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company made one repayment of about $300,000, and so the net amount of taxpayers' money that was given by this Government to Plywood and Plastics Pty Ltd was $7,293,841. That money went missing, and after a lot of urging by me and by others in this chamber an investigation into the recovery of the amount that was to be repaid and the proper use of the subsidy money was entered into&mdash;somewhat reluctantly, I think. Senator Richardson was very much involved in that at the time. He had been run out of the town of Ravenshoe when he was the environment Minister, and the whole question has been a complete fiasco since those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $7.2 million that has disappeared has had fairly catastrophic effects on the town of Ravenshoe. The Parliamentary Secretary might note that the money that was given to that company was supposed to be used by that company to pay wages and also to pay suppliers to the company. It was to pay little people: small businessmen and single traders who gave the company credit because they knew that the Commonwealth Government was lending these huge amounts of money. They assumed wrongly, as it turned out, but one can forgive them for doing so. They assumed that because the Commonwealth Government was putting so much money in there, the Commonwealth Government would be exercising some rudimentary oversight of the operation of the company. So all these little people&mdash;small businessmen, sole traders&mdash;gave the company credit beyond that which they could really afford to give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When, after a period of time, Plywood and Plastics went into liquidation and no trace could be found of this money, those small businessmen did not get their money back. They had extended this credit beyond their means because the Government was lending this company money. Many of them now have joined the ranks of those who are not only unemployed, but also bankrupt. They have joined the huge ranks of the bankrupt that have formed since this Government has been in power, particularly in the last few years. It was as a direct result of this Government's mismanagement of those funds that these people lost their businesses, lost their livelihoods and lost their houses&mdash;lost everything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will never accept responsibility for that. Members of the Government say it is a commercial decision, and nothing to do with them. They say the businesses gave the credit. But the fact is that if the Government had exercised even rudimentary oversight then this money would not have gone missing, those people would have been paid, and the tragedy which has resulted for those people would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the period that I have been in the Senate, I have constantly inquired about this. We have had one series of put-offs after the other. I think we even censored Senator Richardson at one time over his handling of this matter and, towards the end, Senator Richardson seemed to become somewhat contrite. He promised me that he would try to get the Minister to make good that money that those small business people lost. Then with the machinations that happen in the Labor Party from time to time, Senator Richardson got shuffled around and dismissed. The new Minister who took over was not terribly interested. I think Senator Richardson, after a lot of time, had been convinced of the merit of the argument. But, when he went, the sympathy and the compassion that the Government was starting to show disappeared. That is the background to all of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that I reserved relates to the Government's attempt to recover some of this money. I had asked, and others in this chamber had asked, for details of the action being taken to recover the money. We were promised and promised that we would be kept informed. The ASC and the Attorney-General were going to tell us what was happening but, in spite of inquiring every now and then, I got no sensible information. I got one letter from the ASC, but it asked me to keep it quiet; I was quite happy to do so at the time. Then&mdash;lo and behold!&mdash;I see that in the further estimates some money is wanted for a court case to recover this money. I was not advised about this and I was very disappointed that the Government did not comply with its undertakings to keep me informed of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now find that the Government has instituted some proceedings. I asked at the estimates what these proceedings were all about. The answers that I have been given show that the Government is suing Plywood and Plastics. One of the directors, a man by the name of Hugh Ferguson Macdonald, is being sued. I hasten to add that, although the spelling is the same as mine, he is absolutely no relation to me; I have never set eyes on the man. I have been told that it is for deceptive and misleading conduct, I think it was. One of the allegations was that he aided and abetted, counselled or procured or was knowingly concerned in deceptive and misleading conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is suing for the recovery of $968,841. Why only that amount? What is happening to the other $6,325,000 that seems to have gone missing? The answer given to me suggests that this is the civil claim being taken by the Australian Securities Commission. There are a final couple of lines that say that there may be prosecutions by the Director of Public Prosecutions, but that if I want to find out about that I should direct some questions to the Attorney-General. I do not find that very satisfactory. It has all come out of this department. I want to know, and I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to tell me this, why we are only suing for that amount. Is any action being taken to recover the balance of the $7 million-odd that went missing because of this Government's ineptitude?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I do not want to interfere with any criminal proceedings that the DPP might be instituting, I would like an indication from the Parliamentary Secretary as to whether proceedings are being instituted. And, without disclosing things that may make those prosecutions more difficult, could the Parliamentary Secretary indicate to me the general ambit of criminal proceedings to be instituted, when they are likely to be and what the course envisaged for those proceedings might be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I will seek detailed advice for Senator Macdonald. Could I just say to Senator Macdonald that, from my own experience in the cost of maintenance on aircraft, for $40,000 people might get a new decal on the tail and a coat of paint if they were lucky. I would suspect, but I will get more precise advice because this is a CAA issue, that an amount that small in terms of aircraft would probably not involve any matters relating to the safety of the aircraft at all. It would be like slapping a fresh coat of paint on the house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ex-military CT4 trainer aircraft as they stand are not eligible for the issue of a full civil certificate of airworthiness. Pacific Aerospace Corporation of New Zealand holds the type certificate for a civil CT4 aircraft which meets full Australian civil certification standards. These standards are based on those applying internationally. It may be possible to modify the ex-RAAF aircraft to enable a full certification of airworthiness to be granted. However, the details and cost of this are entirely a commercial matter between an applicant and Pacific Aerospace. It was made clear to potential purchasers that without modifications the aircraft are eligible only for a permit to fly as ex-military aircraft. The permit carries a number of restrictions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pursue this, but could the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Collins) tell me how much the aircraft sold for last Saturday, if he has some idea? Whilst he says $40,000 is not much money, some air cadet schools were wanting to buy them but I understand that the price was to be a couple of hundred thousand. Was it? That $40,000 extra was a lot of money. It may not mean much in safety but it is a lot of money if people are buying them. My question, which I suspect the Minister has probably answered, is: if it is safe for them to be flown by RAAF people around the airspace, why is it not safe for civilian people to fly these aircraft? They are the same aircraft. What is the difference? People out there find it hard to follow the bureaucratic regulations when RAAF pilots can fly them around but civilians cannot without spending another $40,000 on them.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Minister was helpful in his responses to my requests and had indicated to me that a decision had not yet been made on where to locate this facility, but indicated also that there would be no technical reasons why it should not be located in Melbourne, for example. It raised an important issue and I now seek some response from the Minister. I note his constructive comments in the estimates committee and I hope that we can continue on that basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity in the last few weeks to look fairly closely at the structure of the ABC, and where the staffing and facilities of the ABC are located. I think there is concern about this and I have spoken to a number of other colleagues who can give me feedback from their own States. There is concern that whereas the ABC markets itself as&mdash;and certainly tries to be&mdash;the national broadcaster, to a certain extent it can be seen as, and has been criticised as being, the Sydney broadcasting corporation. People say this because of the huge concentration of ABC resources in that city. They note, for example, that the ABC is largely financed by taxpayers right around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether all Australians give their 8c a day, but a high proportion of that 8c&mdash;I suspect that it is about 5c of that 8c&mdash;is spent, not in their own States, but in Sydney. There may be some basis in history for this level of expenditure and concentration of resources, but the first thing I put to the Minister is that, whatever the historical reason, the advent of new technology such as satellites and e-mail has meant that&mdash;in my view and from advice I have received&mdash;there is no longer the need for that concentration of resources in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of pay TV, the ABC was most forthcoming in regard to questions that I put to its representatives about where the expenditure of ABC TV revenue was made. I think I am correct in saying that $270 million of taxpayers' funds are spent on ABC TV, and some 70 per cent of that is spent in New South Wales. Then we looked at other aspects of the structure of the ABC and we found that virtually all the senior TV executives are based in Sydney as, indeed, are all the radio executives, perhaps with the exception of one. So not only is ABC expenditure concentrated in Sydney; decision making is also concentrated in that city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a feeling around Australia that when a decision is being made about placing a facility here or there, this will lead to a bias towards placing that facility in Sydney. In relation to the Asia TV experience, I notice it is not entirely by coincidence that that facility was placed in Darwin. I am not complaining about that. I think that it is fully in line with the philosophy that I am proposing&mdash;a decentralisation of ABC resources&mdash;and the Minister has perhaps already moved sharply to endorse that philosophy. I certainly do not make any complaint about that because this is precisely in line with the approach that I am proposing. I ask the Minister: where is the actual decision about the location of pay TV made in the ABC? Is it actually a management decision or is it a decision which would go to the board?</PARA>

There is a conscious decision taken to provide a regional spread as well as a skills spread, and I think the honourable senator will find that it is pretty well spread in regional terms. I do not think there is a Tasmanian on it; there is certainly not a Territorian on it. There is a Territorian on the SBS board. I do not know how I missed out there&mdash;I will have a look at that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take those concerns directly to the chairman of the board, Mark Armstrong. I just make this point to Senator Kemp, and I am sure it is one he would acknowledge: the ABC does have an absolutely finite budget. It is, quite rightly, regularly scrutinised and often rigorously criticised in respect of that budget. Regionalisation is very important but there is a cost attached to it, and I am very conscious of that in respect of TV Asia in Darwin. The two sites that were being carefully considered for the location of TV Asia&mdash;I hate to reveal this to Senator Kemp&mdash;were Darwin and Melbourne. That was legitimately so, because Radio Australia is based in Melbourne and possibly it would have been cheaper to locate it in Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In political terms&mdash;and I use that term in its broadest sense&mdash;it would have been very retrograde to have based the Asian service in Melbourne when it is trying to interact with the region. When the ABC carefully balanced the cost of locating staff to Darwin and the necessary travel and administrative arrangements, the final decision was to locate it in Darwin. I will raise these matters directly with the chairman of the board and Mr Hill. The only reason I mention it is that, as I am sure Senator Kemp would acknowledge, one thing that would obviously have to be considered in regionalising would be the administrative cost of setting up in another city, wherever that is, facilities which may already be provided in Sydney or somewhere else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for that comment. I hope that, with the logic he expressed, we are not going to see Radio Australia located in Darwin, too, but I am sure that was not his intention. Once a large range of facilities is located in a particular city, there will inevitably be pressure to locate more and more of the growth of an organisation in that city, so I welcome the constructive response the Minister made to my suggestion. I would like to see a proper analysis done by the board, which I think has a responsibility to all taxpayers who pay their 8c a day to the ABC, to make sure that there is not an undue concentration of activities in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would like to raise goes back to the issue of where ABC TV should be headquartered. The Minister was forthcoming enough to indicate that some 240 jobs would be created in a reasonably short period by the establishment of ABC pay TV. I think one of the officers from the ABC indicated that there would be very substantial knock-on effects, and I have no reason to query this. I have three questions for the Minister. First, is any study available that can help quantify those knock-on effects&mdash;the multiplier effects and the other jobs which would come about through the establishment of ABC pay TV? I realise that the Minister may not have the material here, but I would be very interested to see that. Secondly, when would the Minister anticipate a final decision being made on the location of ABC pay TV?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, prior to that decision being made by the board, will the board and its officers make sure they consult with all relevant people in Melbourne? I am sure they will do this in the Sydney area. I know, for example, that the Committee for Melbourne has a particular interest in this matter, and I have no doubt the Premier would also have a particular interest in this matter. I am sure Senator Carr, who is in the chamber, has a great interest in this matter as well. Would it be possible for the Minister to give me an assurance that before a decision is made there will be widespread consultation with relevant people in Victoria?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can provide the honourable senator with some further details. The $11 million was primarily the result of deferrals in two major projects. Those two major projects were the refurbishment of a lower section of the Gore Hill tower in Sydney, for a deferral of $5.35 million, and the construction of a new transmission facility at Mount Wellington, Hobart, for a deferral of $4.5 million. To allow the refurbishment of Gore Hill to proceed, the NTA must arrange to relocate the transmission facilities for SBS TV to another site. The NTA has been negotiating a sharing agreement with the commercial owners of the Seven/Ten tower at Artarmon, Sydney, where it is intended to place this service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NTA has also been involved in complicated negotiations with the Hobart City Council regarding the approval to construct a new tower on Mount Wellington, at $4.5 million, to replace the existing tower, which has reached the end of its viable life. Due to the need to dedicate resources to establishing new activities that the NTA is now required to undertake, particularly the tendering of major projects, planning for several smaller projects has also been delayed, resulting in the need for deferred additional expenditure of $1.15 million. All of the funding for the projects deferred from 1992-93 will be spent on these projects in 1993-94. </PARA>

The ABC forms 85 per cent of the NTA's client base. Surely it should have been made aware of decisions about this saving of $11 million; surely it should have been made aware of whether this would have any impact on any of its programs.

I am just surprised that the ABC was not consulted or informed about this and that it had not been made aware immediately of the decision that there would be a saving of $11 million in this program.</PARA></TALK.START>

It seems that we have not got any officers here. With your indulgence, Mr Chairman, could I read those questions into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>? They concern the Iranian Embassy debacle. I note in the answer that was given to me that I had asked how much had been spent over the last 12 months on guarding the Iranian Embassy. I received the staggering information that the cost of guarding the Iranian Embassy was some $2,084,440 for less than one year. That equates to $40,000 a week and, having talked to some service personnel, it equates to at least two platoons of military personnel. I wonder whether I could get a breakdown of those costs because we have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we had the inquiry last year, I think Senator Richardson was asking some very pointed questions about the whole mess-up of the raid on the Iranian Embassy that almost ended up like the Keystone Cops. We had all those different agencies involved&mdash;the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, the Australian Protective Service, DFAT, and the Protective Security Coordination Centre. All of them knew what was going to happen, or they believed they did, but they did not tell each other. As a consequence, the whole thing went ahead, and we have the situation where this Government and the taxpayer ended up with a compensation bill of some $469,700, of which $187,200 was paid to the Iranian Government. That bill included $47,500 for damages to fixtures and fittings; payments to individuals from $55,000 down, totalling $282,500; and, quite incredibly, an amount of $US65,000 that was given to them because it was allegedly stolen during the raid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of questions, as Senator Short has said, and I would like to go through them in categories. The first ones are about the handling of the boat people. As the Minister would be aware, we have continued to express our concern that the Minister has ruled out any review of the Government's handling of the boat people currently being held in detention. Six hundred and eighty people have arrived in Australia by boat and there are some 222 people currently in detention, with 13 cases before the courts and 93 cases remaining to be processed by the department. Therefore, I ask the Minister: are there other groups of people awaiting decisions on whether they qualify for refugee status who are currently living in the Australian community&mdash;for example, the numbers of people who arrived here on visitor visas and who then applied for refugee status? What support does the Government provide to these sorts of people?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister also: what proportion are the refugees who have been visaed from the former Yugoslavia of the total refugee intake? What percentage are they of the total immigration intake? How much more money will the department allocate to the refugee humanitarian program this year? How many refugees have been settled in Australia from families in Bosnia? How much has the department allocated to administering this program to 30 June 1993? With regard also to refugees, from where has the department obtained its legal advice concerning the boat people? How much has that advice cost? What sort of advice has the department received from Attorney-General's and has Attorney-General's commented on the Burdekin comment about detaining the boat people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move on to the Chinese students. It is concerning to us that the Government has still failed to make a decision concerning 26,000 people currently in Australia who are eligible to stay in Australia until June 1994 with a special category of temporary resident permit, as a result of Prime Minister Hawke's commitment in 1990. We are aware that, although the Minister claims that the Government does not need to make a decision about these people until next year, this issue is of ongoing importance and concern to the community. That is shown by the report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 May this year of a Chinese student who had originally been granted one of the special permits but was trying to re-apply for refugee status following his return to Australia after a visit to China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put the question to the Minister: how many of the people in Australia with the special temporary S437 visa have exited Australia since being granted their visas? How many have returned to the PRC, either permanently or on holiday? How many have sought to return to Australia, in the same way as the student who was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 May as having been back to China for three months and was now re-applying for refugee status?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further area of concern. We referred earlier to a Japanese crime boss but the questions have not yet been responded to. Senator Bolkus told the Senate on 12 May 1993 that Mr Takumi entered Australia on a multiple visa which had been issued before he had a criminal record. Why has the Government allowed a senior crime boss&mdash;reportedly No. 2 in the Yakuza in Japan&mdash;seemingly free access to Australia? What sort of visa does Mr Takumi hold? Is it a tourist, visitor or business visa? Does Mr Takumi conduct business in Australia? If so, what sort of business? Why was the visa not cancelled when his activities and criminal background were first discovered?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a further question on grants-in-aid. Could the Minister provide a list of grants to community groups, including the amount to each group, its purpose and the date of approval of the funding. The savings of $244,000 are listed under voluntary agencies and community groups. Where have the savings been made? Have the savings affected the level and number of grants-in-aid to community organisations, and what was the $3.098 million budgeted to go as a grant to the Australian Red Cross Society for the asylum seeker assistance scheme? Why has it been possible to make a saving of this particular grant? The citizenship question has a number of other areas associated with it, so I ask: what proportion of permanent residents take out citizenship, and how many people who have been permanent residents for five years or more have not become citizens? How do Australia's requirements for eligibility for citizenship compare with other major OECD countries? I do not know whether the Minister wants to make a response to any of those questions at the moment. </PARA>

In respect to the PRC, having met with representatives of most parts of that community, the Parliament can be assured that that issue is getting ongoing attention.

That support came at a time which was quite relevant in that legislation was before the Parliament towards the end of last year and that support was there then. I also ask people who enter into this debate to realise that not all of the time these people spent in detention has been spent awaiting government decision. In respect of one batch, there was a 17-month period during which government was waiting for an application for refugee status from some of the applicants. Also keep in mind that we have extended rights while some of these people have been in detention. I think Senator Knowles is now ready to proceed. </PARA>

I think Professor Pearce has done a very forensic examination of the problem in the department.

The reason I refer to Professor Pearce's report is that he does make a recommendation that&mdash;he acknowledges that this is, to some extent, going beyond the terms of reference&mdash;some training is required in the department on these questions of law and, if you like, the precedence of law.</PARA></TALK.START>

The two spectacular ones were the Asia Dairy affair and the meat substitution scandal, which almost destroyed a billion-dollar-a-year export industry for Australia. The fortunate thing about these recent problems is that, in the first instance&mdash;that is, the satellite&mdash;they have been substantially corrected by legislation which passed through this Parliament and became law about two weeks ago, and, in the case of the MDS matters, they are properly before the Federal Court. </PARA>

I advise honourable senators, as I have done previously, that the very first action that the Commonwealth took, that Cabinet decision having been made, was to place the matter immediately before the Federal Court, which is in every sense in charge of the matter. As I understand it, the situation now is that the court has determined that the tender process should remain open until 28 May but at that point be frozen while the legal arguments are being canvassed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased therefore&mdash;and I told the Senate this&mdash;to see the public comments made by Mr Stokes, who, I think Senator Alston would agree, is probably the most aggrieved party. Certainly he is the party in the action. He has conceded publicly, having read the legal advice I provided him with&mdash;in other words, I have given him advance notice of the arguments we are going to run in court, which is not a normal procedure, as Senator Alston knows&mdash;that the earlier comments he made were made without reference to those articles. He has now conceded that he is satisfied that the Commonwealth's action in this matter has been, if you like, legitimate and was not for any ulterior purpose, and that there is a real legal problem that has to be addressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to plead the case of Reg and Sylvia Faulkner, who are victims of a 20-year legal battle against the Commonwealth of Australia which has cost them their business, their home and their health in their struggle for justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sylvia Faulkner should be an Australian success story&mdash;an Aussie icon. She was one of the very first women to succeed in the overwhelmingly male field of heavy engineering. In 1964, she set up her own engineering firm&mdash;at the behest of General Motors&mdash;to make motor parts. In 1968, she was the only woman finalist in the inaugural Prince Philip Prize for Australian Industrial Design. Her invention, the trisal clip, a reusable device that could connect heavy loads faster and more safely than conventional shackles, enabled the easy lifting of extremely heavy objects and had obvious wide application in industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The famous engineering firm of Vickers recognised the trisal clip's potential and went into partnership with Mrs Faulkner to manufacture and distribute the clip worldwide. Sylvia Faulkner's troubles began when the Australian Army, having made an initial order, procrastinated about taking the clip, allegedly because of an argument with the Army's engineer-in-chief over who should be chairman of the production company. The engineer-in-chief, incidentally, subsequently resigned after a worldwide police investigation into commercial deals. Sylvia Faulkner had invested $4.5 million of her family money gearing up for the development of the clip. However, the vital seed orders from the Australian Army never came, notwithstanding numerous letters and assurances that orders were forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sylvia Faulkner took legal action against the Commonwealth for breach of contract but was forced into bankruptcy because of repeated legal delays. It was a classic case of a defendant with deep pockets frustrating a plaintiff with only a case to argue. Again, we saw the resources of the Commonwealth pitted against an individual. It is never an equal struggle. In 1981 the now Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, agreed with my colleague Mr Philip Ruddock that the delays were inexcusable and that the Faulkners' case was a classic example of poor administration. Indeed, so close was Senator Evans to the Faulkners that he agreed to sponsor them when they applied to become accredited international lobbyists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding this, when the case finally came for trial in 1987, Senator Evans decided to stop legal aid in a decision with serious implications for natural justice. According to the Faulkners and their then legal representatives, in pre-trial negotiations the Commonwealth had suggested $850,000 as a possible settlement figure. The Solicitor-General was involved in this case, both as an adviser to the Commonwealth as the defendant and as arbiter of the Faulkners' case through the provision of legal aid. The Faulkners allege that the provision of confidential advice to the Solicitor-General for the purposes of obtaining continued legal aid may have influenced the Solicitor-General in his capacity as chief counsel for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a discussion between the Faulkners' barrister and the Solicitor-General from which others were excluded, the Solicitor-General, in his capacity as arbiter of legal aid, then reversed an earlier commitment to cover all the Faulkners' legal costs, which meant that the Solicitor-General, in his capacity as Crown counsel, was almost guaranteed to win the case. The Faulkners' lawyer had advised that the case had a good chance of success provided overseas witnesses could be called. It was in the wake of this advice to the Solicitor-General that the grant of legal aid was amended to restrict the number of overseas witnesses who could be called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Philip Ruddock has suggested that the Solicitor-General's potential conflict of interest, as both chief law officer of the Commonwealth and arbiter of legal aid, meant that this matter was not dealt with expeditiously. My colleague has suggested that, even though the Solicitor-General tried to put a `Chinese wall' between his twin roles, the coincidence between his learning of the nature of the Faulkners' case and his withdrawal of unconditional granting of legal aid raises at least the suspicion of abuse of power. The ACT President of the Council of Civil Liberties has taken up the case and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early on, something went bad between Faulkner and the (Army) people . . . and after that, I think person after person on the side of the institutions did something silly or wrong or supported something wrong and the damage was overwhelming on the Faulkners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very odd things have happened. Legal aid was restricted, the counsel confronted each other and told everyone else to leave. That's strange in itself. It's legitimately a matter for us to ask that individual rights and liberties are preserved from the point of view of the way the lawyers operated in this case.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not arguing today that the Faulkners' behaviour in this whole saga is utterly without blemish. I am not arguing that the rights and wrongs of this case are abundantly clear, but I am saying that the behaviour of the Solicitor-General raises very serious matters for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Faulkners' very plausible allegation is correct, that the Solicitor-General used information obtained in one capacity improperly to influence him in another capacity, then the very integrity of our legal system is threatened. The ultimate rights and wrongs of this dispute are now shrouded in the mists of time, but it does seem that a settlement offer of close to $1 million was mentioned and it is clear that the Commonwealth withdrew that offer after its chief officer happened to learn the exact nature of the Faulkners' case and legal aid was curtailed to prevent them proving it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compared to the amount of money and time the Faulkners have lost in this pursuit, any settlement offer in the vicinity of the previous offer would seem to be little enough justice. There is so much money that governments waste, why not spend some on deserving people who have been put through living hell? In their own words now, they have got to the stage where they say, `Justice or we die'. I believe that the Government ought to renew the previous settlement offer to the Faulkners or, if that is inappropriate, consider the offer of a suitable ex-gratia payment in consideration of the pain and suffering they have experienced at the hands of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government exists in order to do whatever is appropriate to secure a better life for its citizens. In particular, government exists to ensure that justice is done by one citizen to another. Everything that this Parliament does and every act of every government should be motivated by considerations of justice for individuals. Therefore, it is all the more important that the Government which demands justice of its citizens should do justice itself. Granting the Faulkners a measure of justice is certainly not going to set precedents for a host of hard luck claims. How many cases are there of the Commonwealth wearing two hats to frustrate longstanding litigation? It will merely demonstrate that the law of this land does not discriminate between the whale and the minnow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the difficulty that is being presented here, that of obtaining information wearing one hat and the same person&mdash;an officer of the Government&mdash;using that information wearing another hat, is something that has brought about an injustice. I ask and recommend that the Government consider an ex-gratia payment around the sum previously offered to ensure that some justice is done at this late time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express concern about some comments made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) this morning during Matt Abraham's interview program on ABC radio. The comments about Mr Bernard Collaery follow a letter published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> by Mr Bernard Collaery headed, `Detention camps shame Australia'. In that letter Mr Collaery suggests that it is likely that the way in which we handle the detention of asylum seekers is in contravention of our obligations under international conventions. Senator Bolkus responded to this suggestion during the interview by saying that he would not go to Mr Bernard Collaery to run such a case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that that comment is not germane to the issue at hand. The Minister was not addressing the substance of it, he was casting aspersions on the legal professional skills of Mr Collaery. Bearing in mind that Mr Collaery is one of many human rights lawyers who are giving their time and energy free to take up cases of this nature, I believe that concern must be expressed that the Minister saw fit to use the occasion of this interview to reflect in this manner on Mr Collaery. It is likely to cause considerable damage to his professional standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At another point of the interview, Mr Bolkus saw fit to comment on some statement of Mr Collaery's by calling it a `mad loop' comment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia's record on this issue is a shameful one, and that it means that people before Australian courts are not equal. It should make no difference whether the person before an Australian court is a citizen of Australia or an asylum seeker; but the fact is that this Parliament, at the behest of the Government, has passed legislation which makes these people less than equal before our courts. I believe that that is a contravention of basic human rights and that we should revisit this issue and examine very carefully Australia's standing in the international community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In case at some time in the future somebody should look through my contributions to the Parliament and wonder where I was between September and December 1992, and because the official report of the delegation to the United Nations will not be produced until I no longer have the opportunity of commenting on it, it seems sensible for me to use this opportunity to make a very brief report about that particular time, and about some other activities in which I was privileged to be involved earlier this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the vast majority of people who take an intelligent interest in international affairs would be aware of the fact that senior officers of our Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, experts on issues such as disarmament, chemical warfare, development, environment, aid and human rights, are brought in from the capitals of Europe and from Australia for particular agenda items. These officers are well known and highly regarded for their expertise and contribution to the  development of international policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our permanent mission to the United Nations in New York also consists of talented and hardworking officers under the able and effective leadership of Ambassador Richard Butler and his deputy, Richard Rowe. A highlight of United Nations General Assembly 47 in 1992 was the election of Richard Butler to chair the committee which has the duty of preparing for the 50th anniversary celebrations of the United Nations in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I knew that we have highly regarded officers and we have contributed significantly to many issues involved in international policy development, it was not until I was able to take part in some special sessions which were held last year that I realised that we are pre-eminent in a number of social policy issues. There were special sessions on people with disabilities at the end of the decade for people with disabilities; there was a special session on ageing, likewise at the end of the decade; and there was a special session on indigenous people at the beginning of the year for indigenous people. On each of those occasions, I was able to report to the General Assembly on behalf of Australia on measures that we had taken to fulfil, in the first two cases, the objectives of those two decades, and on the initiatives that we were in the course of taking in relation to indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke with people from those many other countries who were contributing to those debates I realised that the policies we have developed over the last decade or so are seen to be models for much of the world, of high quality, and that we compare very well with other countries with which we normally identify. In many cases, the social achievements of Australia over the past decade are seen to be superior to those of most of the rest of the world. I did not just rely on my own colleagues to confirm that; there were members of other delegations coming to us for information, with compliments and requests for further information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the third committee, where I spent most of my time, we were also able to make excellent contributions to all the issues that were subsumed under the heading of human rights. On the occasion of the opening of the agenda item on the status of women, a prominent Australian constitutional lawyer, Dr Hilary Charlesworth, took part in a seminar and made an excellent contribution as a result of her analysis of international conventions, along the same lines as the analysis we have been applying to domestic law in Australia for some years, which is, in brief, that laws of this nature were developed principally by men from the thoroughly patriarchal establishments which have been running the world for a long time; that they have been interpreted by men; and that they have not lived up at all to the assumptions that might have been made somewhere along the way that they applied to all human beings. They did not explicitly or implicitly address the many breaches of human rights suffered by women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming out of the discussion that was held at the UN on this matter and other matters involving human rights, agendas and resolutions were developed that will be the subject of the world conference on human rights to be held in Vienna within the next fortnight. I can report that the Australian delegation had a great deal to offer as a result of the expertise of our human rights specialists, particularly Dr Colin Willis and Dr Martin Sharp. The three months that I had in New York were, for me, busy and stimulating and affirming of the high regard in which Australia is held at the United Nations and of the talent of our officers. The opportunity to be part of that process in 1992 was certainly one of the highlights of my parliamentary career and one for which I am intensely grateful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early this year I was able to go to Paris at the time of the opening of the chemical weapons convention for signing. Parliamentarians for Global Action were conducting a symposium at the same time as the opening of the convention for signature, and about 30 members of parliaments from around the world made their way to Paris for that occasion. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), discovering that Senator Chamarette and I were in Paris for this symposium, invited us to be part of the Australian delegation at the UNESCO meeting where the official opening ceremony was held. Australia was among about 125 nations which signed the convention at that opening. We had the great good fortune and pleasure of hearing the people who spoke at the opening, such as the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Boutros Ghali, Mr Mitterrand and other dignitaries, mentioning with considerable warmth the enormous effectiveness of Australian officers during the last few years when the chemical weapons convention was being finalised and opened for signature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many Australians, the first consciousness that they would have had of our role would have been in 1989 when the chemical weapons manufacturers were invited to Australia to take part in a discussion about how they might contribute to the process which had, at that time, been stalled for 20 or 21 years. The progress since then has been extremely encouraging, and it was enormously satisfying to see this convention, having come to the point where it was opened for signature, being approved by signature by a very large majority of the member nations of the UN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I returned from Paris after this unique experience, I received a phone call from the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs. My response was a perfectly natural one: `Oh, he is going to ask me to lay another wreath'. It actually was the case, but was a wreath laying with a considerable difference. The former Minister was unable to leave Australia during the election campaign, so it was an occasion where he was asking me to deputise for him at the laying of a wreath on the island of Bangka at the dedication of a memorial to the Australian Army nurses who died when they were escaping from Singapore in 1941. Minister Humphreys felt that I was a reasonably appropriate person to send in his place as I had long ago trained as a nurse.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrival of Vivian Bullwinkle bringing the miracle and joy of her survival, but the certain knowledge of so many sisters slain in cold blood must have brought home the greatest horror, of the constant and menacing threat to their lives as Prisoners of War with a deadly secret.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Never, however, do these women, interned, and working with a community of four hundred women and children, lose their dignity, their professionalism, their wit, inventiveness or compassion, or their courage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the fact that all of the nurses contracted malaria, and there were frequent outbreaks of typhoid typhus and dengue, and despite their malnutrition and the physical exhaustion that inevitably resulted from this combination of factors, they made life tolerable. They cleaned filthy rice and improvised variations on their meagre rations in a myriad ingenious ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their creativity knew no bounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One nun's habit plus a rusty needle plus a determined nurse was converted to five pairs of shorts.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They made hats of straw mats, mattresses of rice sacks, and even shoes held together with the tacks salvaged from old furniture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As if just existing were not a full-time job the nurses were forced to work as labourers by their captors, digging out sewerage channels, at a time when rain was the only source of washing water. They went on nursing the sick and helping with the babies. They nurtured each other, rehearsed for choral concerts, held classes for the teenage girls, created art and craft. Theirs was a wonderful example of human resilience and spirit amid the horrors and atrocities that were the appalling hall-marks of the Asian war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are all immensely privileged to be here on the eve of the ceremony which will dedicate the memorial to those nurses who did not return home, and which will renew in our hearts and minds the brave history of those nurses who survived.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak about Bangka but I cannot resist adding a few words to what Senator Giles has said. There is a frontbencher here who would dearly have liked to have been associated with that ceremony on Bangka. I have long had an interest in the plight of those nurses. In February of last year I was in Singapore for the commemoration of the fall of Singapore. I met a number of nurses who had nursed in Singapore and a number of them had tried to get away at the fall of Singapore. Matron Bullwinkle has talked for a long time about the wish to have this memorial on Bangka.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in Indonesia last year, I raised the matter with the Minister responsible for women's interests in the Indonesian Government, who did not know about the issue and who was very concerned to see it go ahead. The Australian Embassy in Indonesia was, at that stage, trying to see what could be done. I came back here and also raised it with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I have had a continuing interest in the matter and I am very glad that after all these years these women's sacrifice of their youth, and in many cases their lives, has been recognised at last. The provision of that memorial was far too long in the making. I am glad it has now happened and I add to Senator Giles's comments on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose today is to speak on matters which should be of great concern to all Australians as we draw closer to the 1994 International Year of the Family. I want to speak about the Australian Institute of Family Studies in the International Year of the Family program. Although the problems affecting each may be somewhat different, the underlying theme is the same&mdash;government mismanagement and broken promises. I would like to begin by drawing the attention of the Senate to a remark in the 1991-1992 annual report of the Institute of Family Studies. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns that the Institute's budget would constrain operations, identified and referred to in last year's Annual Report proved only too real.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial problems persisted through 1991-92. . . These problems persist into 1992-93 and pose a threat to our work and its dissemination and to the exercise of our statutory responsibilities as a national body.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that last comment is very serious. It means that an important institution, a national body, is being starved of funds to the extent that it may not be able to meet its charter. One of the reasons that the institute finds itself in financial trouble is a broken government promise. A specific oral undertaking was given to the institute by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, and this has been broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, the institute began a living standards project which was to cover a period of three years. It is a study which will reconsider how we should define living standards, the poverty line and the role that services play in accounting for the quality of life of families. It will provide detailed information on 6000 households in 12 geographical areas, covering family income, employment, health, education, children's services, housing, transport, leisure, family relationships and personal wellbeing. Honourable senators can see how extensive and how important a project it was. Its cost was put at $1.89 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government said that it was a high priority project and the Deputy Prime Minister, Brian Howe, promised the institute full funding for the project. It was to be the major client. But since then the wheels have fallen off. The funding department, which was the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, has met less than half of what will be the total cost of the project. Not only has the Government been lying to the people of Australia in regard to its election promises, it has also been misleading national institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institute started the study on the basis that it would be fully funded. Brian Howe gave this assurance. After being given $1 million for the project, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet told the institute that this now was all it could expect to receive. All of a sudden, the institute was faced with having to complete an extensive project and yet being underfunded to the tune of nearly $1 million. Asked when the institute first found out that it would not be fully funded, the director said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was about six months after the design and work on the study had been completed. There were delays in the funding process so that we moved ahead on the understanding that it would be fully funded. When it was not fully funded, we had then to rethink the design of the study.</PARA>
<PARA>In order to deal with the breach of faith by the Government, the institute has had to alter the design of the study to reduce costs and to absorb the rest of the costs itself. The situation has become even worse since at Senate estimates committee hearings it was revealed that the final cost of the project would now in fact be $2.47 million. Responsibility for the project has now shifted to the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services under the very Minister who said that the institute would receive full funding for the project and who has stood by while this promise has been broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of this funding shortfall, the institute is having to run itself down. Other important projects have been delayed. There have been no new library purchases for 10 months, and the library houses the best collection of family related material in this nation. It is now 10 months out of date and who knows when it will be in a position to again purchase material. The institute has also been forced to drop two permanent staff in the research and information areas. The ability of the institute to disseminate information has been curtailed. It has lost its national reach since it has not had funds to run workshops or conferences or hold seminars interstate or conduct research interstate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the International Year of the Family nearly upon us and at the very time that we would want the Institute of Family Studies to be at its most effective, this Government is starving it of funds. That the institute should have to say in its annual report that financial problems pose a threat to its work and to its statutory responsibilities as a national body, is a ringing condemnation of the Government and its unceasing capacity to promise something and then blatantly breach that faith. No person or institution in this country can now reasonably believe anything this Government promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a related matter, and that is the Government's program for the International Year of the Family. It has had a short but rather nomadic history. In September 1991, Minister Staples was given responsibility for the International Year of the Family. The international branch was responsible for the early International Year of the Family. In August 1992, the International Year of the Family office was established as a section in its own right in the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. On 11 November 1992, just a few months ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that the office of the International Year of the Family was coming to his department. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have decided to establish an International Year of the Family Secretariat in my department so that I can be closely involved in the year's activities.</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting. What happened was that in January 1993 the arrangements with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet were effected and on 7 February 1993 the election was called. On 23 March 1993 arrangements commenced for moving the secretariat of the International Year of the Family back to the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. Surprise, surprise! The Prime Minister was no longer interested in being quite so closely involved in the activities of the International Year of the Family. So it moved away and on 19 April it was established as a branch within the children's services section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can imagine how this toing-and-froing has seriously impaired the work of the International Year of the Family program. It cannot get going. In the words of the Assistant-Secretary for the International Year of the Family, commenting on the changes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is fair to say that they have not sped up the pace of activity. It is probably inevitable in changes of that sort, including physical relocations, that there is some disruption . . . </PARA>
<PARA>To say that there is `some disruption' is a bit of an understatement. On an insincere and self-aggrandising whim of the Prime Minister, work on the International Year of the Family has been seriously disrupted. A lot of work will be required to get it back on track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recruitment has been delayed, with only five permanent staff appointed. The staff that have been appointed to work on the program do not have specialist research skills or any special expertise in relation to families. They are generalists from the bureaucracy. None of them have any experience in researching family issues. As a consequence, they have been relying very heavily on the Australian Institute of Family Studies for advice and assistance. We all know that that is under-resourced and in great difficulties itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the International Year of the Family program is still not even properly off the ground yet there is only a little over six months until the International Year of the Family begins. When we consider the chain of events, together with the running down of the Institute of Family Studies, what emerges is a totally incompetent and dishonest government which does not really have any concern for the family unless it happens to be election time. We have learnt in the last week that the Government is delaying introduction of the home child-care allowance that was the cornerstone of the Government's appeal at the election to women working in the home&mdash;very important to families where the mother or the parent at home is providing the child care. That is very much a family issue. The Minister for Family Services, as honourable senators would recall, did not even want to answer questions on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would all know from the last few weeks that the duckshoving and the ineptness of Senator Crowley is pretty symbolic of the attitude and performance of this Government in matters concerning the family. It is starving the most important national institution concerned with family issues of funds, it is handicapping Australia's efforts to establish a credible International Year of the Family program and it is breaking a most vital promise that it made to families during the election. So much for this Government's concern for families!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I call for a commonality in accounting standards in reporting on public sector superannuation activity. Whether the Queensland Government superannuation scheme is fully funded has been a matter of considerable debate for some time, and through Senate forums I have been one of the many contributors. The question of funding or not funding is often a matter of semantics. That is, funded and unfunded may be defined in many ways that can support either particular description. The term `funding' is commonly used to describe the provision of moneys for a particular purpose. A holiday may be funded from savings or from a gift or from loans. The term is commonly used to describe government financial support for specified activities or organisations, for example funding for the arts, funding for the Australian Institute of Sport and the like. In this sense, anything on which governments spend their money can be said to be funded by governments. This clearly includes the superannuation of their employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fund, in the general sense, may be any stock or sum of money or other assets which can be identified as an accounting entity, usually and especially one set apart for a particular purpose such as a building fund. The term `fund' is also used to describe an organisation, or group of people collectively, which has members, rules and a governing body, for example the XYZ Superannuation Fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of superannuation, the term `funding' has a more restricted and specific meaning. For example, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement</EMPHASIS> defines a superannuation fund as `an indefinitely continuing fund providing retirement and death benefits'. The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income support for the retired and the aged</EMPHASIS>, stated that funded schemes are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . superannuation schemes which finance the payment of benefits by drawing on an investment fund into which contributions have been paid.</PARA>
<PARA>It continued that unfunded schemes are those which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . finance benefits from the current resources of the employer rather than from an investment fund. They are typically found only in the public sector . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act the definition of `superannuation fund' is, firstly, `an indefinitely continuing fund', and, secondly, a fund `maintained solely for one or more of the following purposes: the provision of benefits for each member of the fund'. In fact, Ronald Mendelsohn, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation and Retirement in Australia</EMPHASIS>, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding: (1). . . is an arrangement whereby assets are set aside during a person's lifetime or working period from which his or her pension or other superannuation benefits are paid during retirement. (2). . . the process of accumulation in occupational superannuation plans. Most such plans are funded. Contributions are paid, usually regularly, into a fund controlled by trustees and are available to pay benefits. Some plans are still unfunded; benefits as they fall due are paid by employers from their own resources.</PARA>
<PARA>From the foregoing, the necessary elements of a funded superannuation scheme appear to be the following&mdash;and I list them: firstly, the existence of a clearly defined and readily identified accounting entity, producing accounts and therefore capable of being audited; secondly, the dedication of the fund exclusively to the provision of superannuation and related purposes; thirdly, the payment into the fund of contributions from employees and also employers; fourthly, the accumulation and investment of assets to produce a flow of income; and, finally, the payment of benefits to members from the fund. There is general agreement that schemes that provide for the payment of benefits by employers as they fall due are regarded as unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we then apply these definitions to the Queensland State Superannuation Fund, we find that, at a hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 21 February 1992, the Director of the Queensland Government Superannuation Fund, Mr Hennessy, was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that, nationally, most State government funds and the Commonwealth are substantially underfunded, but I had heard that, in Queensland, it was not. What is the position with your fund?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hennessy replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our government funds are fully funded, both from the employee and the employer perspective, and the funding is kept up to date. Both the employee and employer funds and contributions are assessed by the State actuary every three years. . . We got in early, before the liabilities were built up. The problem in the States is that they not only now have to meet their unfunded emerging benefits, but they also have to fund the future benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>This is found in the record of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at pages 1167-8. The references to `our government funds', `the employer and employee perspectives' and `both the government and employer funds' point unambiguously to the existence of two funds, that is, in the context of superannuation, two discrete accounting entities, dedicated exclusively to superannuation, whose assets are invested and from which the benefits flow or are paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference by Mr Hennessy to the problems of other States having to meet their `unfunded emerging benefits' and having `to fund the future benefits' is a clear recognition of the current usage of the term `unfunded' as applying to superannuation. After expressions of doubt in the Senate as to whether the Queensland funds were in fact funded, Mr Hennessy actually wrote to the President of the Senate explaining that the funding of the employer component of the Queensland Government superannuation liabilities is held in Consolidated Revenue&mdash;and I refer to the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 30 November 1992, page 3805. The form in which the fund is held is not stated&mdash;whether it is in cash balances, government securities or merely an acknowledgment of a liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The characteristics of the Queensland State Government Superannuation Fund are described in two reports of the State actuary&mdash;firstly, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the funding of the Crown's component of State super benefits</EMPHASIS> dated 10 October 1991, and, secondly, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The actuarial investigation of the State Service Superannuation Fund</EMPHASIS> of 8 August 1991. Both reports deal with the position as at 30 June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports' titles are quite significant in this respect. The report on the funding could refer to funding in the broad sense of the mere provision of money, whereas the actuarial investigation of the fund clearly implies a superannuation fund in the accepted sense. Similar ambiguities abound in the report on the funding of the Crown's component. In the second paragraph on page 1 it is stated that the Crown's contributions are paid into a separate fund to the members' contributions, implying not only existence of a Crown fund but the payment of employer contributions in parallel with the members' contributions to the members' fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next sentence, however, states that `benefit payments are then shared by the members' and the Crown's funds in a proportion determined by the actuary'. The next paragraph refers to the funding of the Crown's component of the benefits. While these statements could be applied to conventionally funded benefits, they could just as validly be used to describe the payment of unfunded benefits on an emerging liability basis. The first paragraph on page 2 again clearly implies a specific fund into which the Crown contributes $2.31 for every $1 of member contributions, and from which five-sevenths or 74.4 per cent of the defined benefits are paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report then includes a table, the main figures of which indicate the value of benefits and expenses payable by the Crown, $4.75 billion, less the value of assets, $2.948 billion, leaving an amount required to be funded by the Crown of $1.802 billion. So the value of actual future Crown contributions is $2.430 billion, with a surplus in the Crown fund account of $628 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would appreciate, Mr Deputy President, such a table has some unusual features. The nature and the repository of the assets are not stated, nor is any allowance made for the future earnings on them. The value of the future Crown contributions is shown as an asset, but these contributions are actually made on an emerging basis&mdash;as are those of other States and the Commonwealth, whose superannuation liabilities are accepted. No doubt if one were to use such terminology as the Commonwealth and the other States are using the Queensland methodology could be shown to be `fully funded', which clearly they are not; so it is arguable that the table shows an unfunded liability of $1,802 million. That is the amount to be funded by the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if we then go to pages 7 to 9 of the report, several reasons are given in justification of a retention of the present rate of Crown contributions, none of which has been taken into account in the original calculation of the Crown's liability of $4,750 million. If these reasons are valid then the Crown's liability should be put at $5,378 million, bringing the deficiency to $2,430 million. All these figures assume the existence of a fund with net assets of $2,948 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee on superannuation has been unable to verify the existence of such a fund. Its inquiries have been met with the statement that it is `in the Consolidated Revenue account', whatever that phrase might mean. It is repeated in Mr Hennessy's letter and the report on the members' fund, which does not deal with the fund set up in the Consolidated Revenue account. No mention of a superannuation fund is made in the Budget papers, although the existence of one could be inferred from table 5.4 in the `Public Sector Financial Assets and Liabilities' section of statement 4, where cash and investment balances are shown at $3,841 million at June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a fund is in existence, it could easily be verified by the production of an audited set of accounts, together with evidence of its dedication to the provision of superannuation benefits. On the basis of the above figures, it would have an unfunded deficiency of $2.4 billion. If there is no such fund, or if there is merely a series of IOUs from one government pocket to another, then the government superannuation liability would be clearly unfunded and would amount to around $5.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the following five points are worthy of comment. Firstly, there is no evidence of the existence of a fund, in the ordinary superannuation context, into which government contributions are paid and from which benefits are met. Secondly, there may well be cash and investments in the Consolidated Revenue Fund set aside for superannuation&mdash;presumably the $2,948 million of assets shown in the Actuary's report for 1990, and possibly the whole, or most, of the $3.6 billion in the 1992-93 Budget papers. Thirdly, if this is regarded as `funding'&mdash;which is doubtful, since there is no evidence of a legal restriction on its appropriation for other purposes&mdash;there still remains an `unfunded' shortfall of at least $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there is a need for the adoption of public sector accounting standards which set out a common approach to reporting superannuation of funding or unfunding. Only then will the public know of the real extent of the State or Commonwealth debt in the superannuation area. Fifthly, if there is no scope for collaboration to bring about a commonality of accounting standards in this critical area of public sector activity, then, at very least, the newly appointed Public Accounts Committee in the Queensland Parliament should conduct a far-reaching inquiry into the matter, calling on experts to second-guess the advice which has been given to date. The New South Wales and the Tasmanian auditor-generals could give some useful advice. From an academic point of view, another writer on the subject, Professor Bob Walker, from the University of New South Wales, could also offer independent and professional advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to this matter being the subject of further scrutiny. Particularly I call on the Queensland Public Accounts Committee to conduct an investigation because I think that as a result of that we would all be a lot wiser. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to canvass this alleged large bad debt provision beyond saying that it came at a time when the Prime Minister, his Ministers and his press office were denigrating my comments about inadequate financial reporting by this half-owned piggery group of his as unsubstantiated muckraking. However, I cannot verify&mdash;and I stress this&mdash;the accuracy of the document I have just read as my previous attempts to verify allegations made to me about this group of companies that the Prime Minister half owns have resulted in legal action being taken against me and a blocking of further attempts to undertake my parliamentary duties. So in this case I have reluctantly been forced by the threat of legal action not to check this document with the Commonwealth Bank as I normally would have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this bad debt provision is particularly significant in view of the fact that the liabilities of five of the seven Brown and Hatton Group companies significantly exceeded their assets, according to the 1991 accounts finally audited and presented to the Australian Securities Commission last December. This prompted the auditors to qualify their accounts in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of normal business activities and the realisation of assets and settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The continuity of normal business activities is dependent upon the continued support of the company's ultimate shareholders together with the support of bankers of the group of which the company is a member. Financial support has been forthcoming from the group's bankers to the date of the signing of this report.</PARA>
<PARA>That qualification, of course, is very significant. It exists in relation to those companies whose liabilities exceeded their assets, that is, five of the seven in the group which were subject to public company audit. An additional one, Rincraft, also had a substantial deficit but has not been subject to audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the auditors, the fate of this group of companies half-owned by the Prime Minister rests with the Commonwealth Bank which this document says has written off $4 1/2 million from this group as a bad debt. By the way, the loan amount of $17 million-odd is against an equity of only $860,000 put in by the owners, Messrs Keating and Constantinidis, and their family companies. It is a gearing ratio that many farmers presently being put off their land by foreclosures would have loved to have been able to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 6 August, the date of this document, the group has filed a whole series of returns with the Australian Securities Commission outlining increased losses. I have no knowledge of whether the bank was aware of these further losses that were reported for the year to June 1992 to the ASC in February 1993. These losses were substantial and, I repeat, unaudited, because no longer was there an auditor's requirement because they had reverted to proprietary company status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the loss for the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd for the year 1992 was $2,971,276. The loss for Brown and Hatton Wholesale Pty Ltd was $423,501. For Jensay Pty Ltd the loss was $562,016. The loss for Olympia Refrigeration Sales Pty Ltd was $1,168,878. The loss for Olympia Industries Pty Ltd was $634,641 and the loss for Olympia Interiors Pty Ltd was $124,785. These losses were only in small part offset by a profit by Brown and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd of $1,862,363. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These very large losses follow the audited losses and audited returns provided by the company as a result of my pressure on the Australian Securities Commission to provide corrected returns for those which were patently incorrect. For example, the Brown and Hatton Group's 1990 accounts showed that it had a profit of $842,999 when, in fact, its audited accounts have revealed a loss of $3,150,041. Its 1991 accounts were stated to show a loss of $1,518,847. In fact, it ended up as an audited loss of $2,842,868. For Brown and Hatton Rural Pty Ltd the 1990 unaudited profit was stated to be $900,416. The audited profit was cut to $855,416. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Jensay Pty Ltd the unaudited result for 1990 was supposed to be a loss of only $7,504. The audited loss was, in fact, $737,936. The Jensay result for 1991 followed a similar massive blow-out, where the unaudited loss was $43 and the audited loss was $412,043. For Olympia Refrigeration Sales Pty Ltd, the original unaudited loss was reported to be $141,143. The audited loss was $800,258 for 1990, and for 1991 there was a further correction from the unaudited loss of $343,548 to $358,983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see that these significant audited losses, on top of the unaudited losses about which I have expressed concern, appear to have further deteriorated the financial position of some of the companies in the group. These results caused the stated shareholders' equity of the group to be significantly reduced as well, although the accounts must be treated with care because they are unaudited. At least the latest lot are unaudited. The stated shareholders' equity for the companies in the group are negative in most cases. For example, the Brown and Hatton Group has a stated shareholders' equity of minus $3.7 million. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was about good news, which is that to which I was referring. I can confirm that the Treasurer has today released the Development Allowance Authority's report for the March quarter of 1993. This authority was established in the One Nation initiative to provide a tax benefit of an additional deduction of 10 per cent for eligible projects with a capital cost of $50 million or more. The report as released provides details of applications received and those registered by the authority as at 31 March 1993. The report confirms that the authority has received applications for approximately 500 projects involving capital expenditure in the period to 30 June 2002 of well in excess of $100 billion. Of this, expected investment in plant and equipment constitutes some $75 billion. The investment expenditure peaks in 1995-96 but remains strong through the remainder of the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>

Every time any bad figure appears, as I have said, people leap on it with glee&mdash;that is, some people&mdash;and enjoy taking it out of context. When the last lot of investment figures came out, those opposite took them as gospel; and when the good ones three months before came out, they were as silent as the grave. That is always the case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate representing the Prime Minister. I remind the leader that this is my last day in Parliament and I am deeply concerned about Australia's future, so I ask: what is the Government's plan for long term economic recovery?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1474" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of different dimensions to the Government's economic strategy, which can be briefly summarised. It ought to be understood that it is, necessarily, a multi-dimensional approach that we have adopted. What we are about is improving our international competitiveness through higher productivity and lower inflation; what we are about is improving our productive capacity through higher investment performance for sustainable high growth; and what we are about is increasing national saving to finance investment domestically without having excessive recourse to foreign borrowing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wages policy and industrial relations reform under the accord are now focused on workplace bargaining that increasingly links wage increases to productivity improvements, and on achieving wage outcomes that maintain our inflation rate comparable to that of our major trading partners. That, of course, is a strategy that will help prospects for high employment growth, improve our competitiveness and increase our productive capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our monetary policy, as distinct from wages and fiscal policy, is directed at maintaining low inflation while supporting, as I have said, a sustainable economic recovery. Maintaining low inflation is obviously the single most important factor in achieving low interest rates and, again, sustained low inflation will improve the environment for investment that increases our productive potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the fiscal policy front, what we are about is sustaining the recovery through One Nation and other initiatives while unwinding fiscal stimulus over time, improving, as a result, national savings over the medium term. The interrelationship between fiscal policy and savings policy is one that I recently spelt out in this place. The 1993-94 Budget, as I have also constantly said in this place, will outline a medium term fiscal strategy to improve the fiscal position, but it will not involve a substantial fiscal adjustment in one year that would obviously jeopardise the recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to all of that, we have a continuing micro-economic reform program, including competition policy, which will help to remove impediments&mdash;such as they still are&mdash;to greater flexibility and productivity and lower costs. Employment and training programs, at the same time, will assist the unemployed, improve the skills base and enhance employment and productivity. Those are the elements. I am indebted to Senator Lewis for the opportunity to spell them out in a systematic way, because the Government does have a systematic approach to the whole question of the recovery to ensure that it will be sustainable and that it will produce the jobs that this country needs in the future. I am indebted to Senator Lewis for the question and I wish him goodbye.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like very much for the Government to be able to do something to relieve the ongoing tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is exactly as Senator Sowada has described it. It is a disgrace in this day and age that events of this kind should be occurring. There is an awful sense of impotence in the response hitherto of the international community, which we particularly share being as far distant as we are and as manifestly unable as we are to influence a course of events that is unable to be influenced by the combined resources of the European Community, the United States and Russia, all of which have been, as Senator Sowada is well aware, intimately involved in working together to try to find some common ground for a solution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has much to do with the nature of the conflict and the terrain in which it is being fought as any absence of will on the part of those countries and the international community to deal with it. I think that needs to be understood in any too-abrupt or cavalier dismissal of the response hitherto of the international community as being inadequate. It is a very different kind of conflict from that which the international community confronted in the Gulf war with a single frontier being invaded. It is a very different kind of conflict even from the one in Somalia, which represented, in effect, the failure of a broken back state and a massive humanitarian intervention being necessary but possible in the particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has proved, for practical purposes, impossible to get consensus in a productive way through this dilemma except through the sanctions strategy that is being applied with increased rigour. The current collective strategy which has been agreed to by the so-called P4 and which is currently being further considered by the Security Council does involve at the very least a kind of holding or containing action to try to stop things deteriorating further. As Senator Sowada no doubt will be aware from press reports, it involves the securing of safe areas for Bosnian Muslims by UN forces; the use of air power to support UN forces guarding these areas; monitoring the implementation of Serbia's sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs; and a strong warning to Croatia that it too could face sanctions if it supports Bosnian-Croat attacks on Muslims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other dimensions to the current argument that is going on. But that is really where we are at at the moment. It is just an attempt at least to stop things getting worse. I am simply not sure how we could contribute to making things actively better. If Senator Sowada has any specific suggestions, I would be delighted to hear them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One further thing that has happened in the last 24 hours is that the Security Council has now decided unanimously to establish an international tribunal for the specific purpose of prosecuting people responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1 January 1991. That is an initiative which Australia has strongly supported.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In contrast to the rather overdrawn account of Dr Mahathir's recent Seoul speech which appeared in the Australian media, particularly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, a close reading of that speech to the Pacific Basin Economic Council actually makes it clear that Australian and Malaysian thinking on regional trade arrangements is very much in tune.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Mahathir's speech was an extremely impressive and articulate defence of the concept of open regionalism in terms which closely match the kinds of things that we have been saying on this subject for quite some time. The elements of that concept of open regionalism are, in particular, that countries should go into regional arrangements with the determined purpose of liberalising trade and investment amongst themselves; that they should not raise trade barriers to non-members in doing so; and, further, that they should have the intent of actually reducing external barriers faced by non-members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Malaysia and Australia see it as important&mdash;Dr Mahathir said as much&mdash;that emerging trade groupings in our region be as open as possible and that their members commit themselves to continuing to reduce barriers to trade with others outside their grouping. That is very much the approach that Australia and New Zealand have adopted both in their general attitude to regional trade groupings and in our own bilateral CER arrangements. Unfortunately, as Dr Mahathir has observed, not many trade groupings pass this crucial test.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That meeting early in February discussed a whole range of general issues relating to tender processes. The question of the potential invalidity, a potential technical problem, was raised in the most general way at that meeting and it was made in the context of that technical breach not even having been confirmed at that point. In fact, what was said at the meeting was that the department was awaiting legal advice on the technicality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record shows it. We have buried the Senate in paper on this. There is no more paper relevant to this issue to be produced on it, and Senator Alston knows that. The actual advice from the Attorney-General's Department did not arrive, I think from memory, until 19 February&mdash;that is, some two weeks later. That was the advice that was referred to at that early meeting&mdash;there is a potential technical problem and we are waiting for advice on it. That advice did not arrive until a fortnight later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the time of that meeting early in February there was no advice to me, as the report clearly lays out. But that is as close as my office even got to it. What that advice does&mdash;and Senator Alston has it in his possession, as does every other person in here&mdash;is lay out the grounds for the court case and the fact that this technical defect occurred. This has been canvassed at length, but I will go over it again. Professor Pearce, I have to say&mdash;and I said it this morning&mdash;deals with it very forensically and very correctly in his report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice from Attorney-General's to the Government was that we would succeed in the Federal Court in having the revocation supported. That did not happen. What was proposed was that, the court case having succeeded, the determinations would be redrawn, the gazettal notice would be reissued and the information paper would be redrawn. In other words, the technical deficiencies that were confirmed on 19 February would be corrected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What subsequently happened was that a proper tactical decision was taken in the conduct of the court case where senior counsel, briefed by the Government, determined that the Commonwealth should not rely on technical defects, should not in fact bring them before the court, because the case was strong enough to win anyway. The failure that then occurred&mdash;and this is when the failure occurred&mdash;was after the court case in not sufficiently and scrupulously examining whether the defects had been corrected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to have the opportunity to set the record straight. As people might have gathered when I was answering that question, I think it was clear that I was surprised at the figures that Senator Knowles produced from the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women in Australia</EMPHASIS>, which, according to her figures, reported a decline in the proportion of women in the most senior academic posts from 13.2 per cent to 7.9 per cent in one year. According to Senator Knowles, this suggested a failure of the Affirmative Action Agency and this Government's efforts in that direction. I was surprised, so when I went back to my office I asked them to check the details.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I might paraphrase <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Casablanca</EMPHASIS>:  of all the statistics in all the publications in all the world, Senator Knowles had to walk into this one. She really picked a beauty because what I found out was that the figures in that volume were wrong. One of Australia's major universities in its return to DEET coded in its figures wiping out a large number of senior women and, I am told, giving themselves 25 vice-chancellors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to report that there has been an increase in the number of women in senior positions in higher education.  I am also happy because it would have been dreadful for women academics, and for all of us who delight in the success of the figures, if the 30 per cent decrease as quoted by Senator Knowles had been right. But I am happy to say that it was wrong. Our affirmative action policies are having a positive effect. It is interesting, because this is the Opposition that, in the last election, canvassed the abolition of the Affirmative Action Agency. This Opposition wanted to see the end of the Affirmative Action Agency. It did not want it continued at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question was a nice little hook to see whether or not it was working. I am pleased to say that it does work. Between 1982 and 1991 the number of women increased not only in absolute terms but also proportionately. I inform Senator Knowles and the honourable senator from Queensland who wanted to know the figures that in 1988 some seven per cent of academics in senior lecturer positions were female. By 1989 that had increased to 7.9 per cent, by 1990 to 9.1 per cent and by 1991 to 9.8 per cent. These are the effects of the Government's affirmative action policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For there to be a lack of understanding of some basic technical legal rules in the context of the administrative policy process is a very different thing from a finding that there is a lack of willingness to respect administrative law principles in the conduct of the administration of this country. As I understand, the particular problems that showed up in the second Pearce report are essentially technical legal problems that were insufficiently addressed in the course of building, developing and presenting to the public an administrative policy approach. It was not any lack of sensitivity to administrative law as such, which has been the subject of a great deal of attention obviously within the Public Service over, as Senator Durack says, the last two decades almost. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the state of the Public Service that we inherited in 1983, a lot had to be done. We would all remember, I take it, the roo in the stew meat substitution efforts, not to mention, although it is a little tasteless, I know, to refer to this on Senator Durack's last day here, the Perth Deputy Crown Solicitor's escort services.

The report is also valuable in reminding us that it is the law, as so enacted, that has to be what is actually implemented and not something else.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Is the Minister aware of media reports that call for rapid and radical action to move the Budget towards surplus? Can the Minister inform the Senate of the practical differences between that type of radical, rapid approach and a medium-term approach to moving back towards surplus?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1483" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="ARTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, of course I am aware of such media reports. There have been a few recently, and most of them would appear to be comments by members of the Opposition. Yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> identified one private sector economist as advocating the rapid and radical approach. No-one would be surprised to know that that was Mr Des Moore of the Institute of Public Affairs. No-one would be any more surprised to know that Mr Moore appeared to be in a distinct minority in this view. In fact, were it not for the Opposition, he would be very lonely in it. Virtually all other professional economists reported in the media over the recent period support the medium-term approach for fiscal policy in Australia. The principal reason for that is that any rapid or radical approach to withdrawing the fiscal stimulus the Government fed into the economy would put at risk the pace of economic recovery now under way in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of company profits which I referred to earlier in response to Senator Childs's question is further evidence of that recovery. The fact that that recovery is under way is widely recognised and accepted by the overwhelming majority of professional economists. I note also that the new Treasury Secretary, Mr Ted Evans, concurs with the thrust of that medium-term strategy. He suggests, quite correctly I believe, that calls for heavy expenditure pruning in the forthcoming Budget reflect political assessments rather than economic analysis. But the Government is committed to paring back the Budget deficit to around one per cent of GDP in 1996-97 and to a 1993-94 Budget deficit that is close to that of 1992-93. That means it will be well below the $18 billion no policy change starting point figure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, a large number of economists are taking essentially the same view, including the senior analyst for Australia of Moody's&mdash;but, of course, not Mr Des Moore. He is the only exception, apart from representatives of the Opposition; for example, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer, who in a speech last Friday called for large-scale cuts in government spending. In some sort of time warp, he repeated that call on Sunday when he refused to explain which areas of government funding he wanted to see cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he did say in response to Laurie Oakes was, `We put forward a program in the last election of where we thought government spending should be reduced'. Some people never learn! `We put forward a program in the last election'&mdash;and the people said what they thought of that excellent program and made a very astute judgment about it: they rejected it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us think about why they rejected it. What were some of the proposals that Mr Downer, the shadow Treasurer, has just revisited? He proposed that we should cut $82 million from Aboriginal services. This is in the interests of social justice, I imagine, to help those who are doing too well&mdash;they are too affluent, they are getting too much, cut $82 million from there. Or perhaps we could cut $10 million from legal aid because there is a bit too much affluence there too, too many people doing too well, a bit of social justice; or $20 million from community development employment programs; or, in my own area, $4 million from the Australia Council, for example, just to help the cultural development of this nation. No wonder Senator Baume correctly said that they had a dreadful cultural policy at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is quite clear that the proposals for rapid and radical cuts to the Budget should be rejected on economic grounds as well as on social grounds, as they were by the people at the last election and as they will be by this Government.</PARA>

Just in case we have this industry starting to succeed in achieving great international recognition, what a wonderful time to chop it off at the knees. Of course, Mr Moore thought that was too modest. He thought we should abolish our assistance to the film industry altogether and then proceed to withdraw $50 million from the Australia Council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew that would cut Senator Crichton-Browne to the quick as he is such a sensitive soul. The current completion date for the terminal is January 1996. We are currently engaged in discussions with the Federal Airports Corporation about the practicality of bringing that date forward. I might also tell Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen that the FAC is, in fact, about to announce the letting of very substantial tenders for the major steel construction for that terminal. So there is about to be a considerable amount of money committed to its construction in terms of putting up the external fabrication of the building very shortly. I think probably in the next week or so that will be announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the planning matters that is being addressed in respect of the terminal&mdash;although I can assure Senator Bjelke-Petersen that this will not delay its completion at all&mdash;is the Government's policy initiative in terms of the amalgamation of Australian and Qantas and the possibility now for Ansett, or any other domestic carrier, to have an international arm. With the amalgamation of Australian and Qantas, that airline will also have an international domestic arm. I might add that that arrangement is commonplace around the world. Until the recent policy changes were made, Australia was almost unique in that this did not happen here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provides the opportunities for terminal arrangements to be made that are quite different to the ones we have now in terms of an airline operating both international and domestic flights. That matter is currently being considered in terms of all our major terminals such as Sydney and Melbourne.

Mrs Kelly, in her letter to Mr Minson, has suggested consultation on the Nullarbor region between her department and officials from Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer the Minister to the Bureau of Industry Economics report on international performance indicators with regard to the waterfront. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that government and port authority charges at Australia's five major ports are $107.48 per tonne equivalent unit. By comparison, the port average for 10 major overseas ports was only $45.39, or some $62.09 less&mdash;that is, $6.2 million more on each 100,000 tonnes equivalent units of cargo from Australia. I ask the Minister: when is this Government going to become serious with regard to such outrageous government and port authority cost structures and address the fact that, despite all the hoo-ha about waterfront reform, our ports are just simply not internationally competitive?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we were in the happy position of running the ports around Australia, we would be able to do something directly about it. We are not. In fact, one of the interesting things about the proposals put to the Australian electorate and, I might add, comprehensively rejected by the coalition prior to the last election, was the startling proposal that the Federal Government would privatise the ports. As I said at the time, it would come as a hell of a shock to the State governments which actually own them that the Commonwealth Government was proposing to dispose of assets which, in fact, we do not own. At that time the Opposition cheerfully ignored&mdash;it was probably total ignorance&mdash;how the ports actually work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ports in Australia are State government responsibilities. The Bureau of Industry Economics reached different conclusions about different aspects of Australian port operations, and it is important to be clear about what it actually said. The bureau found that State government and port authority charges in Australia were substantially higher than those experienced for similar cargoes and ships overseas. The results clearly emphasise what I have been saying in this chamber for three years: we need to achieve more efficiencies in the port sector&mdash;that is, the State government responsibility&mdash;particularly now that significant reforms have been delivered so far as the waterfront and the stevedoring sector are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will be discussing the scope for further port reform with the States following the release of the Industry Commission's final report into port authority activities at the end of this month. On the other hand, the bureau's report provides further confirmation that there have been major improvements in the operating efficiency of Australia's container ports in recent years. The bureau concluded that in some cases Australian productivity levels are approaching observed best practice in similar sized overseas ports. Of course, no-one in the coalition wants to highlight that. The bureau also concluded that the operating efficiency of Australian coal and wheat handling ports approaches, or is already at, world best practice. Stevedoring arrangements at wheat ports were a major focus of the waterfront industry reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, through the conference that ATAC has set up for consultation between the Federal Government and State transport Ministers the question of increased efficiency in Australian ports will be discussed between the Federal Government and the governments that are directly responsible for them, that is, the State governments. State governments are aware of the need to improve the ports under their control, and most States have addressed the problem. New South Wales has certainly made progress in that area, and the Queensland Government&mdash;just to name two States&mdash;commissioned a major review into the operation of all its ports which resulted immediately in it reorganising and replacing most of the existing port authority boards which had been a sinecure for retired National Party figures prior to that for about 20 years.</PARA>

No data was supplied to support the use of the drug for osteoporosis in males nor for its use as a preventive treatment for either males or females. If the manufacturer can supply data indicating that the drug is cost-effective in males, the expert committees to which I have referred will reconsider extending the uses of the drug.

He referred to the use of Zoladex for endometriosis. ADEC will consider an application to extend the marketing approval of Zoladex to cover this condition at its June 1993 meeting. The fact is that ADEC cannot approve a drug for a particular medical indication without data to support it. The crux of this argument is: no data, no approval. There obviously could never be approval.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of my department's finding was that there was no impediment to its inquiry into the seven charges against Mr Dan, which I referred to yesterday, proceeding. Evidence that a version of the document held elsewhere had been altered did not affect my own department's inquiry process. I have not myself seen the actual documents. I have no requirement to do so, consistent with the approach that I outlined in my initial response to Senator Knowles's questions yesterday. My office referred Mr Dan's letter to me on this matter of 13 April to the department for direct reply. A further letter from Mr Dan to me has similarly been referred to my department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated yesterday, had the department found evidence of tampering with the documentation connected to the disciplinary action it is taking against Mr Dan, it would have referred that matter automatically to the AFP in accordance with a memorandum of understanding between the department and the AFP and I would have been advised of that action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that the department has sent a reply to Mr Dan's letter to me of 13 April and that a reply to the more recent letter is being prepared. The inquiry officer had already replied to Mr Dan's letter to him, informing Mr Dan of the results of the department's investigation. I am advised that the letter from Mr Dan's solicitor of 11 March 1993 did not refer to the tampering issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What all that boils down to is that my department has, therefore, promptly taken all the appropriate steps in response to Mr Dan's raising of this matter. I reiterate that it is not appropriate for me as Minister to intervene in the detailed scrutiny of all the matters raised by either side in this or any other disciplinary action, for that matter, taken by my department pursuant to the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act. The department proceeds strictly in accordance with the Act on the basis of legal advice and keeps me informed of significant developments. That procedure is being adhered to in respect of the department's disciplinary action against Mr Dan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be inappropriate now&mdash;as it is likely to be in the future&mdash;for me to comment in any more detail on this case, given that this inquiry is in process and given that action is being taken, as I said, by another department in response to my department's referral to it of the tampering issue.</PARA>

<PARA>I admire Senator Richardson's defence of his department. Senator Richardson pumps himself up in excess energy. I had never seen him so energised as when I asked him a question on a medical matter. I can only regard this as a reflection of his reaction to me. I appreciate his attitude for that. I seem to get under his skin. Perhaps he needs a dermatological consultation or something of that nature. I might be seriously concerned if this gets more and more each time. I am pleased that we are rising until August or he might suffer further medical consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee is a legitimate and properly constituted body comprised of eminent members of the profession, just as I do the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. In fact, the chairman of one of those bodies is a close personal friend of mine, and I do not think there would be any more eminent person to chair that body. Senator Richardson has totally missed the point. It is all very well to go on and on about the eminence of these bodies and their attitudes, on a scientific basis, to the allowance of these drugs onto the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, but the facts of the matter still stand. If one is a premenopausal woman with breast cancer then Zoladex is not available today. He told us yesterday, and I accept it, that it is in the process thereof and that as of 1 August that will be so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is, from the point of view of the Rocaltrol trials, that if one is a male with a compression fracture of the vertebra, one has to pay up to $100 for that drug. The only way for somebody to be covered would be if that person was a postmenopausal male. That may be an allegation made about some members on the other side of the chamber, but it is not a scientific fact as yet. The facts are that today, if one is a postmenopausal female with a crushed fracture of the vertebra, that drug is available to that woman under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme; but if one is a male over the age of&mdash;shall we say&mdash;50, that drug is not available to that person under the same scheme. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Newman this day, relating to Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>My question related to whether the Minister for Health could rule out any further rises to the Medicare levy following the one due on 1 July this year when it will go from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent. Anyone watching Senator Richardson would have thought that he was a bit like a cat dancing on a hot tin roof. I said a cat, but I do not know whether a cat has fingers to cross behind its back while it dances. He was really in a bit of a quandary as to how to avoid the question and not give a pledge to not increase the Medicare levy during the life of this Parliament. The situation is that, unless something `turns up', the Minister really is on a hot tin roof. He will not give that pledge on the Medicare levy because he knows that, inevitably, the levy will have to rise again. One presumes that it cannot wait until the next election; it will have to be done before then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister knows that he cannot implement the co-payments which were outlawed a year or so ago because there is no Caucus support for them. That is why they were wiped out when Mr Keating became the Prime Minister. Similarly, the Minister knows that he will not get sufficient support in the party room for the introduction of tax incentives for private health insurance for individuals. But he desperately needs some more money; the health system is going broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He says that he will do better at catching instances of fraud and overservicing. But the Government has been pretty ineffectual in this area already. So far in 1991-92 it has recovered $1 million from Medicare fraud and $55,000 from chasing overservicing. So the Government does not have a crash-hot record when it needs hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you will recall that the former Minister for Health, Brian Howe, said on the 29 August 1991 that if the co-payments were overruled, a Medicare levy of 1.53 per cent would be needed with further increases in the future. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would require a lift in the Medicare levy from 1.25% of income to 1.53% and because this would not stem the growth in service use, further increases in the levy would be required in later years.</PARA>
<PARA>So we can see why Senator Richardson was not prepared to give a pledge today. He has his fingers crossed hoping that something will turn up, but goodness knows what it will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also tells us that he will keep all the election promises in relation to health. I ask again: where will the money come from? He has already put the emergency dental health scheme on hold. That is down the track now. He has acknowledged today that his Government's promise to buy back beds in private hospitals for public patients will not work. I told him that during the estimates committee hearings. He claimed that he would get private hospitals to agree to the scheme, but now he acknowledges that that will be very hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has been on the public record saying that 100,000 people on waiting lists for elective surgery is not a crisis. Today he claims that he will spend every cent he can to reduce waiting times and lists in public hospitals. Apparently, he is now prepared to acknowledge the seriousness of those awful statistics. Those statistics are not just numbers; they are people in pain, suffering in queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He claims that he will increase health research. How will he do it all? The fact is: there is not enough money in the health system in this country to meet the existing commitments let alone fulfil those hollow election promises. More money has to be injected into the system, and the only options are to introduce co-payments, increase the Medicare levy, introduce tax incentives for private health insurance, claw back any fraud, cut services and ration health care. That is why Senator Richardson is dancing on a hot tin roof. He does not have many options and he has to come clean in the end. He cannot prevaricate much longer. Where will the money come from?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by Senator Evans, in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Lewis this day, relating to the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party sent Victoria broke&mdash;not a bad effort. Victoria was a small, viable State which had a lot of industry and where transport was not a great cost, yet the once great Australian Labor Party managed to bankrupt Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government did that while appearing, for most of its term of government, to be quite reasonable. The public were actually lulled into thinking that Mr Cain was a very nice and reasonable Premier, until ultimately the full enormity of what the Australian Labor Party had done to Victoria fell upon the people of Victoria. They were appalled and determined that they would throw out the Labor Party at the next election, and that is what they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem stems from a lack of control over the Government's own expenditure. The Government squeezed the State dry; it looked for every avenue of revenue it could get; it taxed the people of Victoria; it used the institutions of Victoria, such as the State Bank, to raise revenue; and it imposed taxes and raised revenue. The Government then wasted the revenue because it failed to control its own expenditure, in particular on its own staff. The Government kept increasing the number of State employees to overcome problems that it believed existed in various areas, and the result was bankruptcy for Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Government is now in the process of doing exactly the same thing, because it has all the money. Every opportunity the Federal Government has it creams off the revenue of this country. It is failing to exercise genuine control over its own expenditure, and that is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened is that this country is already bankrupt. However, as the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said yesterday, Australia is not bankrupt because the Government has the right to raise additional revenue. This year the Government will make the decision to borrow another $16 billion, or more, to add to our national debt, but it says to the Australian people, `Do not worry, we are not bankrupt because at some stage in the future we can increase taxes to pay off the debt so that the country is not bankrupt'. That is what the Government is saying to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party always forgets that if people have no money and no incentive and if there are no desires in the community then they give up hope. Once the Australian people give up hope they stop working overtime, business people stop bothering to increase the size of their businesses and withdraw into their shells. They try to cope with the possibility of bankruptcy, they try to just survive, they refuse to employ more people, unemployment increases enormously, the burden of the social welfare bill gets bigger and the country is then in desperate trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening now is that every person on the magnificent sum of more than $50,000 a year&mdash;which is thought to be very generous and sounds like a great amount of money&mdash;is being taxed enormously. Once all the taxes on that sum have been paid there is not much left. Not only are those people paying income tax at the rate of 48.5c in the dollar, but they are also paying a Medicare levy of 1.25 per cent, which is about to be increased to 1.4 per cent. In addition, they are required to pay 5 per cent of their income to some life assurance company for superannuation benefits that they have no control over and one of these days&mdash;when they are old enough&mdash;that life assurance company may give them their money back. One day they might get the money back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people are taking home about 44 per cent of their earnings and they have lost their incentive. This Government has no plan in any way to overcome that problem. Therefore, there is no money available for venture capital and the nation's small businesses are contracting. Those that have  the opportunity are going overseas. The nation is in diabolical trouble and this Government is talking about a republic or anything else that might divert the attention of the people and this Parliament from the problems of the nation. I say to this Government that it has no long-term economic policy which, as far as I can see, will enable this country to recover from its present problems. </PARA>

<PARA>I want to make a response on behalf of the Opposition to the answer given by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel on this matter of the review of Australian honours and awards. This is in accordance with opposition policy. The Opposition supports this review and we have confidence in the committee that has been appointed.

Mr Bilney claimed that many people felt cheated by Australia's rigid adherence over the past 40 years to the old imperial honours system. Even if one believed that, one must remember that the Australian system of honours has certainly been in place since Federation, so it is far more than 40 years. There is none of the atmosphere of Mr Bilney's press release in the current Minister's press release and the Opposition compliments him for that.

<PARA>This answer by Senator Crowley, which was another dorothy dixer, was an attempt to cover up the appalling spectacle that we saw last week when Senator Crowley obviously did not know what she was talking about in relation to affirmative action and the number of women employed in senior positions in universities. Having claimed last week that the figures had actually risen&mdash;when, as was quite correctly pointed out by Senator Knowles, the number of women in senior positions in universities had dropped from 13 to 10, a drop of 30 per cent&mdash;Senator Crowley today attempted to correct that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Senate to note that, even though Senator Knowles originally asked her question one week ago, it took a week to obtain some sort of response, and the response was highly inadequate. I listened very carefully to the answer given by Senator Crowley today. As someone who has conducted professional research in universities and has some knowledge of statistics, I was curious to know how that drop of 30 per cent could suddenly turn out to be an increase. The only explanation that Senator Crowley gave for this was that one university had submitted incorrect figures. I take it that she meant that figures were reported on the wrong line, because she did talk about 15 vice-chancellors in one university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the Senate that, even though one university might have got the figures wrong, it would take an enormous university to turn a drop of 30 per cent into an increase. It would take a university as big as the University of Southern California to turn that figure around in that way. There is no university of that size in this country. So I believe that Senator Crowley was speaking nonsense. It was the only reason that she gave for the turnaround in the figure, in a desperate attempt to prove that her affirmative action program had worked. It clearly has not worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look at those figures more closely. I place on record in the Senate today that Senator Crowley should table those figures. Unfortunately, as it is the last day of Parliament, we will not have a chance to look at them or debate them today. After she has tabled the figures, Senator Crowley can be assured that I will look at them over the winter break. When we come back in August, we will see yet again that Senator Crowley does not know what she is talking about in relation to affirmative action for women.

<PARA>Senator McMullan let his normally high standards slip a little in his response to Senator Maguire's question, particularly when dealing with an allegation that the Opposition was going to cut $20 million out of total funding to film in Australia. I draw the Senate's attention to the reality. During the election campaign, the arts policy of the coalition showed that a coalition government would be committed to creating an environment in which a creative, highly professional, efficient and competitive Australian film industry would prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revival of the Australian film industry, which was generated by support measures under the Gorton, McMahon and Fraser governments, all coalition governments, and which created an international awareness of the quality and style of Australian film and of Australia itself, cannot be guaranteed to continue without a sound financing base. This is the problem that the Government now faces. The failure of the present Government's film financing strategy underlines the need for policy reform. Senator McMullan should get off his backside and start doing something positive, instead of misrepresenting the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the facts. According to the latest Budget papers, the Hawke-Keating Government had intended to cut support for the Film Finance Corporation in half, from last year's $68 million, which itself was a reduction of $5 million from the Forward Estimates, to only $35 million in the current financial year. It was doing this `in recognition of the Government's expectation that the corporation should increase private sector contributions and its revenues'. The abject failure of this policy is evident from this year's ad hoc emergency injection of another $34 million into support for the film industry in 1992-93 by this Government, restoring its overall Budget allocation to $84.8 million, as against the original projected $50.8 million, in order to save the Film Finance Corporation from a funding disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This crisis emerged because of the withdrawal of private sector investment support for Australian films, with the volume of funds subscribed under 10BA tax incentives under this Government falling from $55 million in 1991 to only $21.2 million in 1991-92, with further falls indicated in the current financial year. This disaster in Australian film investment under this Government is not simply the result of Mr Keating's engineered recession; it is largely attributable to the inflexible and unrealistic basis on which private sector investment is expected to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when outstanding film successes such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS> have generated widespread national interest in Australian films, it is incredible that no ready investment medium is available for ordinary Australians, other than major investors, to invest in individual Australian filmmaking ventures. That is a direct consequence of this Government's policies. Whereas the Government wanted to cut funding in half for the Australian film industry, the coalition wanted to improve the arrangements under which private investors could make up this difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking positive measures to restore private sector investment, the coalition's policy sought to achieve the objective that the present Government has unsuccessfully sought of being able to significantly reduce direct government funding without diminishing in any way the total funds available to the industry. That is why I am so irritated by Senator McMullan's claim. He did not go on to admit, firstly, that we had other ways of funding the film industry which would have increased its total funding and, secondly, that his own Government intended to cut film funding by just about the same amount as we proposed. Our policy said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To tide the film industry over its transition to a less subsidy-dependent position, the Coalition will limit the reduction in direct government funding of the FFC from this year's $61.9 million to $48 million in its first three years in office . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is comparable to the Government's own projected cut to $50 million by 1995-96; but, as this was to have been backed by far greater incentives from private sector investment, overall funding for the film industry would have improved considerably under a Hewson government. What a shame Senator McMullan did not tell the whole story. I hope that in his role as Minister for the Arts&mdash;and I look forward to his being a successful Minister for the Arts&mdash;he is a little more careful in dealing with the truth. </PARA>

<PARA>After getting this answer, with a little difficulty, honourable senators were able to see that this issue is indicative of the problems that occur when bureaucracies are allowed to overwhelm enterprises. The enterprises in question here are ones which are attractive, growing and in great demand internationally; that is, the production of the very sort of primary product which is getting so much attention from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Simon Crean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased that we were told in Senator Evans's answer from the Minister that a subcommittee will treat as a matter of priority the matter of gaining access to exports markets for organic produce. It is called `organic produce', but what that means is that it is produce which has been made in the primary industry without exposure to pesticides or artificial chemicals of any nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that a subcommittee is treating this as a priority is recognition of the international trend to seek this sort of produce. It is a trend that was recognised by Australia's Rural Industry Research and Development Corporation which reported in May 1990 on the market for Australian produced organic food. The Senate should be interested to know that on page 62 of that report we are told that opinions expressed during the survey conducted by this group and corroborated by overseas experience suggest that the specialist organic retail market can currently bear premiums&mdash;that is price premiums&mdash;on organic products of up to 35 per cent over what it calls conventional products. The report further goes on to say that, as the market increases in size and a larger number of less committed consumers start buying organic produce, it is expected that those premiums that can currently be obtained will diminish. But at this stage, in the early part of the development of this particular market, considerable premiums are possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is important because at the threshold of achieving those premiums are many members of Australia's dried vine fruits marketing organisations. While it may seem that it is not particularly important how many organic sultanas or currants are sold overseas, we should be aware that the organic market in the United Kingdom is estimated as being worth over $200 million; and, in Japan and the United States, markets of similar or even superior size are becoming available. I think it is important that we recognise this. It is one thing for this particular subcommittee to see this as a priority, but to actually achieve an expansion into this market area is even more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, this very day, some of Australia's dried fruit producers have a product which is in high demand internationally. But the problem is that that product is not able to make its way on to the export markets because of the equalisation arrangements which exist at the moment in our dried fruit industries. The effect of that is that, if a producer manages to find a market&mdash;and I must say that these markets are actually coming to Australia; buyers are actually coming here trying to find the very clean, green product Minister Crean is talking about&mdash;on the introduction of the producer to the potential buyer, we find that the producer is unable to get any of the premium for himself or herself but in fact that that premium returns, under the equalisation provisions, to the equalisation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that it would perhaps be more appropriate to introduce categories of product in this market to recognise the premium that is paid for special categories of product. For example, certified organic products are different from the other dried fruits that are on the market. If they were recognised as such, a considerable international market could become established and our producers could take advantage of it. I am very pleased that this is a matter of priority. I hope it is treated in that way and that we will get a very quick resolution of this problem. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill amends the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992 (the Principal Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Principal Act to extend the development allowance to projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspect of projects in the print media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments re-open the application period for projects in the motor vehicle industry and the print media that were previously excluded from the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus the amendments allow proponents to apply for the development allowance for projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspect of projects in the print media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments reflect commitments made during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While extending the eligibility of the development allowance to such projects, these amendments also ensure that projects relating to these two industries must meet competitiveness tests in relation to work practices and input pricing, which under the Principal Act could otherwise be waived where the project sponsor is able to show that, prior to 1 January 1993, there was substantial commitment to completion of the project. That is, these amendments would provide that, irrespective of whether there was substantial commitment to completion before 1 January 1993, to be eligible for the development allowance projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspect of projects in the print media would have to meet the competitiveness tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All other criteria in the Principal Act, including the $50 million threshold would need to be met by projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspect of projects in the print media industry, in order to be eligible for the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to a more detailed discussion of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Additional Projects</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill defines additional projects now eligible for the development allowance. In particular, projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspects of projects in the print media are defined and the Principal Act's basic eligibility test modified so these projects are now eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Industry Definitions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill adopts a wide definition of the motor vehicle industry to include the manufacture of vehicles and components. The Bill also defines printing production to include the printing unit and ancillary facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Timing of Applications</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Principal Act to re-open the application period for projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspects of projects in the print media until either 30 September 1993 or until 28 days after this Act receives the Royal Assent, which ever is the later. This will ensure the affected businesses have sufficient time to lodge their applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Criteria for Granting Application</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, as noted earlier, this Bill amends the Principal Act to specify that in order to be eligible for the development allowance, projects in the motor vehicle industry and the printing production aspects of projects in the print media must meet the competitiveness tests in relation to work practices and input pricing, irrespective of whether there was substantial commitment  to completion before 1 January 1993.</PARA>

<PARA>I have negotiated these terms of reference with the Government and the Opposition and I believe that they are acceptable to both sides. This motion would establish a Senate select committee to inquire into matters arising from the pay TV tendering mess of the past few months. The Democrats have said all along that any Senate inquiry should deal with matters which had not been adequately processed by the two Pearce reports. The Pearce reports are thorough, well-considered and consistent with the mountains of documents tabled in the Senate. I believe that there are about 4,000 pages. We have read them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are satisfied that Professor Pearce has identified the problems, and there are many. They include: a lack of understanding of the law and its importance in policy development; an absence of clear guidelines for price-based licence allocation tenders; poor document handling; and sub-standard file management. Sections of the department and the Minister's office have a great deal of work to do to rectify those problems and implement public service accountability requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point in the coalition's proposed inquiry, which it brought up last week, because we believe that it would go over the ground covered so adequately by Professor Pearce. We are very pleased that the coalition has agreed to the terms of reference we have now put forward. However, there is every point to an inquiry into questions which Professor Pearce was not required to answer, and in ensuring that thorough corrective action is taken by the Minister and his department. We need to ensure that, as far as possible, there is no recurrence in this department, or in any other, of this mess. In other words, we are not interested in re-inventing Professor Pearce's wheel. The problems have been identified; we now want to look at the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has highlighted the fact that Professor Pearce was not asked to comment on the doctrine of ministerial responsibility in the handling of pay TV licence tenders. It is quite clear that there is no agreed contemporary definition of ministerial responsibility. There is no agreement on where the line should be drawn between the responsibility of Ministers, their advisers and the senior officers of their departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first phase of our proposed two-stage inquiry would seek to define ministerial responsibility, and suggest where the lines of responsibility should be drawn. The first report should be tabled in the Senate by September this year. The second phase of the inquiry would start in September at the latest, and would examine the corrective action taken by the Minister and his department in response to the problems identified by Professor Pearce. This three-month delay is designed to give the Minister and his departmental head time to put solutions in place and report to Parliament on what they have done. The second phase would start once those reports were received, which could overlap with the first phase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the second stage cannot be stalled, we have set a deadline of 6 September, after which the inquiry would proceed regardless. The Democrats' proposal for an inquiry is practical and sensible. It provides for continuing parliamentary scrutiny of ministerial and public service performance, without needlessly going over old ground. I commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion to establish the Select Committee on Matters Arising from Pay Television Tendering Processes is now before the Senate because there is a general recognition, both in the community and in the Parliament, that the events of recent weeks have been quite unsatisfactory in terms of establishing norms of responsibility and in terms of identifying the extent to which the processes of one department, in particular, are satisfactory. We have said consistently that the only way to really attack these matters is not to have an internal inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In December 1992 the Government brought legislation into this place that, in part, proposed that pensioners who invested in shares would, from September 1993, have unrealised capital gains treated as income for the purposes of assessing their pension. The Opposition expressed its concern about this at the time. From the moment we discussed the legislation, we said that we thought it was inequitable and that it had problems, and that in government we would review it. We are not in a position to review it so we have done the next best thing we could in opposition. In conjunction with the Democrats, we addressed the issue because we felt that there was sufficient concern in the community. Also, we had made a commitment to pensioners, in particular, that we would attempt to do something if we were in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When speaking to that legislation, I said that I doubted the validity of the principle underlying the Government's proposal. We were effectively prevented from opposing the amendments that went through in 1992 because they were attached to other benefits. We had the prospect of a gun being held at our heads&mdash;that if we opposed the amendments relating to unrealised capital gains for pensioners, some of the other benefits would not flow. That is why we did not oppose that amendment at the time. As I said, we made a commitment to review it and we have done that in conjunction with the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We attempted to raise this as an issue and give the Government an opportunity to address the problems by putting a private member's Bill before this House and the House of Representatives. The private member's Bill that was introduced into this place was supported by the Democrats. The week before last a social security Bill came before us and the Democrats and the Opposition took the opportunity to put pressure on the Government to address the issue yet again. Our private member's Bill still stands. However, we took the opportunity to use our private member's Bill as the basis for an amendment to social security legislation that was before the Senate. That amendment was passed in this House and the legislation was sent to the lower house. But the Government has yet again seen fit to return that amendment to this chamber. In doing so, it is denying pensioners&mdash;many of whom have small amounts of money that they have saved&mdash;the opportunity of having some sort of financial predicability. </PARA>

Those benefits would be jeopardised if we oppose the motion that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has moved. We are clear about what will happen if we oppose the motion. Mr Keating told us that in no uncertain terms yesterday. In fact, Mr Keating knows so little about what goes on in this chamber that he was wrong. But he did not have the good grace to go back into the House of Representatives chamber and admit that he was wrong.

They will see that the Democrats welcomed and supported the initiatives. What does Mr Keating say? He went through each of those initiatives and said that we opposed and rejected every item of benefit. He does not understand what we did. Not only does he not understand but also, when speaking in the other place, he misrepresented what we did. </PARA>

I, like my colleagues, do not want to rehearse the argument that has been well run in the media. It has been put without any substantial contradiction by the Government or its representatives, or anybody who agrees with the Government&mdash;although I have not found anyone who does. The argument that has been rehearsed by the media in that way has been well presented and has not been successfully countered by any representations from the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no factual basis for this move against pensioner shareholders. I suggest that the best thing the Government could do would be to pay particular attention to the submissions that come before this committee which Senator Patterson has proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the coalition has been convinced that the Government will not accept these amendments as part of the social security legislation. As Senator Patterson outlined earlier in her speech, the Government ran a very snotty little blackmail session yesterday, which disgusted those who heard it and which should continue to disgust anybody who reads the transcript of it in the future. The contribution by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was foul in the extreme in the way that it purported to give to people who are concerned with pensioners motives which they do not have, motives which I reject and motives which I think the Prime Minister was stretching the depths of a gutter brain to find. The people concerned should not be insulted by ever having to read it. But there it is in black and white&mdash;just what the Prime Minister said. Senator Patterson was right to bring those disgusting phrases into this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern Senator Lees just passed by us is one that is shared by a number of people. If the principle is continued of redefining the English language to such an extent that capital gains is determined as income, where will it end? In the previous argument, we mentioned that it could well apply to other capital investments such as land, the family home, artwork, antiques et cetera. But the principle could equally apply to PAYE taxpayers who have capital gains and who are anticipating the right payment of capital gains tax when they redeem their capital investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the principle that is being established here, PAYE taxpayers would be assessed annually for the increase in value of their capital portfolio. There might be some justification for doing that if all taxpayers had their share portfolios, land, family home, artworks, French clocks et cetera, valued each year and had to pay tax on them. We might then see some sort of equity, which is supposed to be the motivation for this Government's move in this area but which, of course, it is not. It is not equity; it is a complete misunderstanding of the way the world works and the way people plan for their future. It is most inequitable in its delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee will also be able, without a great deal of difficulty&mdash;I reckon it will take it about five minutes&mdash;to demonstrate the lack of factual basis for the calculation of potential savings for the Government. Another five minutes is probably all that will be required to demonstrate to the committee that it will cost the Government as much to administer this nefarious scheme as it might save. It will take perhaps another five minutes to demonstrate that Australia will not be well served at all and that Australian investment will suffer. After that, we will be able to get down to the real issue of how fair it is and how it should be dismissed entirely. Consequently, I certainly support Senator Patterson's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personally, I am not convinced that the Government would have withdrawn the original legislation, because the social security legislation onto which this amendment was originally tacked was necessary. It was blackmail and a bluff, and that is illustrated by the sheer invective that the Prime Minister came out with; that was the usual song and dance routine that we have seen from the Prime Minister, and it had about as much substance as any of the others. I think the Government would have eventually backed away. I do not accept the bluff at all.

In a sense, all human life passes through this place, along with one or two other species from time to time. We learn a lot about each other's follies and foibles, and our attractive points as well, in the inordinate amount of time we spend here together and it is an occasion of genuine sadness to see people leaving, even some of those whose demise on occasions one may have been fervently praying for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longest serving of our departing senators, and a person whom I personally will be very genuinely sad to see go, is Peter Durack, who came here many years ago in the early 1970s. Peter is a man who in his own quiet way I once would have referred to as sleepy, but that was before I became a statesman. Peter is a man of genuinely Liberal reformist instincts. Peter is a thoroughly decent human being. I gave him a terrible time when he was Attorney-General and he did his best to reciprocate in the years that followed when he shadowed me through various portfolios. But I think we came genuinely&mdash;I do not know whether today has been a counter-example of that&mdash;to respect each other's commitment to good government and good policy and to form one of those funny kinds of friendships that are possible across party lines in this place.

But all that said, I have never suspected or seen any actual malice about Shirley.

It is just a pity that John Button is not here to wave her goodbye. The two of them have been fluttering eyelashes at each other across the chamber for as long as I can remember. </PARA>

I think I can say, again notwithstanding today's exchange, without any dissimulation or any gilding of lilies, that Austin Lewis is one of the most liked parliamentarians in this building. His honesty and his frankness have got him into a lot of political trouble from time to time. He has not had quite that same kind of teflon coating that seems to have enabled others, maybe equally deserving, to avoid that kind of fate, but those qualities have never lost him any friends in this place. Even Paul Lyneham was heard on one occasion to describe him as an `immensely likeable, easygoing sort of chap'. There are not many of us around this place who have had that accolade from Mr Lyneham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other non-Labor senators leaving as well. Janet Powell, who came in as a Democrat in 1986 and who leaves us now as an Independent, I think won a great deal of respect and admiration for the way in which she has withstood, with apparently infinite good cheer, the buffeting of what has been, on any analysis, a pretty tumultuous political career. She said when she became the Leader of the Democrats, `You'd have to have rocks in your head to be a political leader'. I think we can all understand that sentiment, even if it was not only the Australian Democrats that she was talking about. One monument that Janet can be very proud of is the tobacco advertising prohibition Bill, which is one of the very few private member's Bills ever to make it to the statute books in the history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Karin Sowada has been here the shortest time of all the departees, but she has certainly made her presence felt in a variety of ways during that period. It may cheer her up to know that, while it is pretty much par for the course for all Australian Democrats to reduce government Ministers and senators to wailing and gnashing of teeth from time to time, Karin Sowada has single-handedly, over the last two years, caused more distress to the Government than nearly all her colleagues put together. I think that might make her feel better. She will now be able to put all that practice in digging holes for the Government back into a professional context as she resumes her career as an archaeologist. I know all of us in the chamber will wish Karin Sowada well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, it comes to departing colleagues from one's own side of the chamber. I suppose it does not follow as an absolute matter of logical necessity that one is sadder to see them go than one's opponents. Nonetheless, for most of us that is a very reasonable assumption. It is with very real regret and nostalgia that we wave goodbye today to Terry Aulich, Graham Maguire, Pat Giles, Peter Walsh and, although it is a little distance from his actual departure, John Button. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say in parenthesis that I know there has been some media speculation that this might also be Michael Tate's last day in the Senate. All I can say in that respect, like the character in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The House of Cards</EMPHASIS> television series is, `You may well say that. I couldn't possibly comment'. If that were conceivably to come to pass, Michael would just have to settle for us saying nice things behind his back; although that is always a much more risky proposition than having it said to one's face, as we all know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terry Aulich, who came in here in 1984 after six years in State politics, during which time he held eight different ministries&mdash;which, in itself, suggests a certain lack of staying power&mdash;has had a career which has been graphically described by Senator Ray at a recent function we had for our retiring members as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Footballer, boxer, teacher, union official, poet, State Minister, party apparatchik, Senator, novelist&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and&mdash;here I am bowdlerising a little&mdash;bulldust artist. Terry's political career has also included residence at one time or another in all three factions of the Australian Labor Party. The chamber will recall that even Billy Hughes took the view that you had to draw the line somewhere but Terry has not shared that view. All this has now caught up with him. He is going off to pursue yet another career. Whether that career will be focused on writing books or pulping them remains to be seen. But, whatever career it is, we wish him well. Terry has been a lively and engaging colleague. There was never a dull moment with him around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Graham Maguire, senator for South Australia since 1983, is another colleague who has in a sense been cut off in his prime as a result essentially of preselection problems. While this is an occupational hazard about which we all have to be philosophical, it is certainly a matter of regret for his colleagues and, I would have thought, in the case of Graham, everyone in this chamber who has worked with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Graham Maguire is the quintessential good, straight, honest, hardworking guy&mdash;nothing remotely flashy about him&mdash;but utterly dedicated to his political principles and enormously professionally capable in the exercise of all his senatorial roles. There is not a malicious bone in his body. I have particularly appreciated, as have many others including people overseas in the foreign relations business, the quite groundbreaking work that has been done by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade under Graham Maguire's chairmanship; in particular, the major reports for which he and his committee have been responsible on India and Latin America. </PARA>

I do not think Pat was ever fully convinced that, on women's issues, I was quite the SNAG that I claim to be&mdash;for the benefit of the Country Party that is a sensitive new age guy&mdash;but she certainly did her best to educate us all. I remember one famous occasion during the course of one of her gynaecological contributions&mdash;a subject on which over the years only Michael Tate has been more forthcoming when he was representing the Minister for Health in this place&mdash;Pat referred to `cytological changes in the cervix' which <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> duly recorded as `psychological changes in the cervix', thereafter, of course, entrenching allusions to the moody interior of the chamber.

<PARA>What Peter Walsh has contributed to this place and to the government of this country over the time that he has been in the Senate is not just his sometimes quite outrageous iconoclasm, but an enormous personal intelligence and integrity; an enormous intensity of focus on the main economic game; and, I have to say, an enormous sense of social justice in the finest traditions of democratic socialism. </PARA>

He has been someone who has given real modern content to that democratic socialist tradition of which we in the Labor Party are still so proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Button came into the Senate at the same time as Peter Walsh&mdash;the 1974 double dissolution. Their careers in a sense ran a parallel course thereafter. But it is hard to think of two more unalike characters. Whereas Peter Walsh has looked for most of his life like, as I described him once, an unmade bed, John Button is a model of sartorial dapperness;  whereas Peter Walsh has made a career out of being a curmudgeon, albeit of the heart of gold variety, I think it would be fair to say that John Button has been the first person since Shirley Temple to build a whole career out of whimsy; and whereas Peter Walsh's inclination was always to crash into the water and swim against just about any tide that was going, John Button notoriously was always the man who dodged the raindrops&mdash;and that was not just a sizeist remark by whoever it was who first made it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Different as his style may have been, there is no doubt that during his time in this place John Button was an extraordinarily successful and effective politician. He was a senator for 19 years; Leader of the Labor Party in the Senate for 12 years; and industry Minister for 10 years during a period of most fundamental and far-reaching industry change and reform in this country's history. John won an extraordinary degree of confidence and respect from industry which was earned by the constant attention he gave to what people were saying about the real world. He won it through his extremely effective style of communication, combined with a capacity at the same time to prompt people into embracing new horizons, not least in our own region. This particular style made him a unique character in the history of this place and I know he will be missed not just by his own side but by the whole chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, in addition to our departing colleagues there is one other unhappily more permanent passing that should be acknowledged with sadness; that is, as you mentioned earlier today, the passing yesterday of Jim Monro the former Second Parliamentary Counsel who, for more than 15 years, put his legislative drafting skills at the service of senators on all sides of the chambers in providing them with amendments in private senators' Bills. I knew Jim Monro very well myself, having given him apoplexy back in 1973 when, as a consultant to Lionel Murphy, I worked with him in the drafting of what proved to be an ill-fated legislative bill of rights. Jim was absolutely unequivocal in his distaste for what he obviously regarded as a heap of trendy nonsense but, like a true soldier, he soldiered on, and I think he was sneakingly rather proud of the result. I am sure all senators will join with me in expressing our thanks to him for what he contributed and, at the same time, our very great sympathy to his widow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, at the conclusion of this session I would like to thank you for once again the grace, the good humour and the firmness with which you have guided our deliberations&mdash;not always easy ones&mdash;in this chamber. We are looking forward to seeing you back next session. I want to acknowledge the work of the Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, and all the staff of the Department of the Senate for providing a very wide range of services which enable this chamber, our committees and offices to run efficiently. I hope all senators will have a good break and come back here relaxed, refreshed and ready to do battle in what will be unquestionably a pretty trying three years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly reflect upon that awful period leading up to Christmas last year when intolerable burdens were placed upon officials in this place. Now is probably not the time to have a go at the Government's management of its program, even though it was largely the mismanagement of that program that got the Senate into that state. It was a matter of sadness for those of us on this side that we were not even given the opportunity before the Government moved the gag in the early hours of the last morning to say thank you to the Clerks and all the staff in this place for the help that they gave us during that difficult period. We do recognise that, even if at times we do not seem to appreciate you, Mr President. I appreciate the opportunity to be able to put that on the record now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer to the sad news that you, Mr President, brought to us of the death of Mr Monro. On behalf of the coalition senators, I record our condolences to his family. Although I did not know him personally, I do know of the great help that he gave to Opposition senators who were mainly in the business of drafting private members' Bills and the like, and we very much appreciated his help and expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is principally the occasion on which we say a few pleasant words about our colleagues who are departing and to give them an opportunity to say about us what they really want to say on this final occasion. I might take the reverse order and just mention the senators on the other side who are retiring and whom we wish to recognise for their contribution to the Parliament, and some of them to government, and to wish them well in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, Senator Button is not here today, but we must recognise him for what, I guess, could be referred to as an enormous contribution to Australian parliamentary life and to government. He served here for 19 years. He was a shadow Minister for two years, industry Minister for 10 years, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate for three years, then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate the next three years, Leader of the Government in the Senate for 10 years and so one could go on. He certainly left his mark in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess what impressed me most about Senator Button was that fine balance of a good sense of humour plus his intellectual capacity. The blend of that often helped to make this place more interesting. I recognised and appreciated that. I also appreciated the clear dedication that he put to his work in industry. We did not always agree with the policy he implemented but it was interesting to note the number of constituents who came to us in the course of having seen the Minister first and who commented on the fact that Senator Button, no matter how busy, was always prepared to listen and hear their cases and give fair judgment on their cases. That might be a lesson to Senator Evans in the years ahead. Constituents are important and it is worth listening to their arguments. I wish Senator Button well in his retirement. He is somebody who will be missed in this place and, according to some, has already been missed in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh, of course, is a great character in here&mdash;a fine political mind, as Senator Evans has said. He brought to this place a good political instinct which, I believe, is something to be respected. He has lots of courage and has always been prepared to say what he believed no matter what the consequences. That is something that we appreciated also. We look forward to what he will say later in this debate and we wish him well in his retirement from this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have served with Senator Giles on a number of committees. I have always admired her dedication to her causes which were never forgotten. She was always in there fighting for the issues that she believed to be of great importance and often neglected, particularly women's issues. I heard her the other day when I went to an Amnesty International lunch. She was first on her feet to demand of the speaker what Amnesty was doing about one particular important women's human rights issue. I think there are many Australians who should be appreciative of her contribution to the Senate during her period here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Maguire should not be going, I have to say. The fact that you are is an indictment upon the Labor Party. It would probably be improper of me to say more than that as he will no doubt seek preselection and come back either here or at the other end in due course. We noted that practically through the whole of the last parliament when somebody needed to be called on at short notice to respond to an MPI in the economic area, so often it was Senator Maguire. We recognised his skills in that area. I particularly want to record what I think was important and that was the role that he played in the Senate foreign affairs committee, his chairmanship of that committee and some of its very significant reports in recent years that I think have, in themselves, made a contribution to improving Australia's international relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know Senator Aulich as well, but he has also brought a sense of humour to this place on occasions during Question Time. Terry, I wish you well. </PARA>

I presume that you are going, senator. I do concede that The Hague will enable you to continue your legal interests with the International Court of Justice and the association with Rome that I understand will be linked with it. This will enable you to present Australia's view to that high authority in a way that is in our best interests. We wish you well in Europe, Michael, and we hope that you will always have a bed for colleagues who might be passing through. That is one of the requirements of ex-parliamentarians who get these jobs. I just thought I might let you know that in advance. </PARA>

I had quite a lot to do with Senator Powell when she was Leader of the Australian Democrats. I found that I could always be confident of what she said to me.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me now to my colleagues. There are four of my colleagues who are retiring and who, I think I can fairly say, have made an enormous contribution to both parliament and politics in this country. Senator Durack has had 22 years in politics, Senator Walters 18 years, Senator Lewis 17 years and, although Senator Bjelke-Petersen has been in politics all her life, she has been with us in this place for 12 years. That is some 69 years in total of contributions to Australian political life that will end today. It really makes this quite a significant day in our political history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Durack retires with an immensely impressive record. When one looks at his background, one finds that he was a Rhodes scholar in 1949, he had three years in the Western Australia Parliament, was a Fraser Government Minister for repatriation, the Attorney-General for six years, Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate for five years, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1983 to 1987, and then again from 1990-92. As I have said, that sketches a parliamentary career that is both long and incredibly impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt others will refer to his period as Attorney-General, and I endorse what Senator Evans said. I think of this time as a period of reform. I think of the administrative law reform that he brought into effect by setting up the AAT. I think of the Human Rights Commission that he established and his early work in relation to a freedom of information Bill. I was reminded that even before being a Minister he did a lot of groundwork in relation to the Family Law Act as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. So one could go on. He was very much a reformist from the day he got here and throughout his period as Attorney-General. We owe a great debt to Senator Durack for his contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a personal point of view what struck me about Senator Durack is the dignity with which he has always carried on the business of politics, his skills and his judgment, which has always been impeccable. If one wants advice, not only would one always get it from Senator Durack but one could be confident of that advice because it would be sound and sensible. I guess it could be summed up in the word `professionalism'. He is a highly professional parliamentarian, someone who can retire proud of his contributions and someone who retires highly respected within the community. Peter we today recognise, with appreciation, all you have done for Australia and wish you well in your retirement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third of my colleagues I wanted to mention was Senator Lewis. Senator Lewis is one of those examples in politics where he has been a bit unlucky with his time. It is unfortunate, we think, that we have been in Opposition for the last 10 years or so. If that had not been the case and Senator Lewis was retiring now, we would have been talking about Senator Lewis having been a government Minister for a long period. He served for over five years in the Opposition shadow Ministry. He served in a number of different shadow portfolios, such as communications and industry and he was Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate for three years. Austin can retire being proud of his contribution in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again from a personal point of view, apart from Austin being a genuinely good type of person, it is his fighting characteristics that I will remember. Some of his speeches when he took on Senator Button on industry policy I will remember for a long time. We heard again today in his final question in this place a deep concern about the future of Australia, the future for those who are unemployed and the future of the young people of Australia. I think it would have been in Australia's best interests if he had had the opportunity to be industry Minister for some years and contributed to an economy that would have been much more sound than it is today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to turn to my friend and colleague Senator Bjelke-Petersen. This is a special day for the National Party. Sir Joh started his parliamentary career in 1947. From 1947 until today there has been a Bjelke-Petersen in the Queensland or Commonwealth parliaments&mdash;nearly 47 years. Senator Bjelke-Petersen was involved in politics long before she entered the Senate. She was involved as the wife of the Premier. I am told that she received her first political invitation on her honeymoon, which was to open the Murgon State School fete. Florence is known in Kingaroy as the deputy member for Barambah because she represented her husband at countless functions and because she listened to his constituents and reported their concerns to him and action was always taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Joh was commissioned Premier in 1968. During his time as Premier, Queensland experienced unprecedented economic growth. His was not a government that always made the easy decisions. As Premier, he made controversial decisions which I think were, in the end, in the best interests of Queensland. It was a State that was lifted to an economic powerhouse under his leadership. In 1977 he removed the State death duties, lifting a significant burden on the farm sector&mdash;a decision that forced every other State government to follow suit. Sir Joh's Government pioneered the development of the State's mining industry and it held taxes down. He did a great job for Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Florence stood beside Sir Joh during his time as Premier, despite the controversy and all the other pressures that were mounted on their lives. For many years, through controversial issues, Senator Bjelke-Petersen stood shoulder to shoulder with the Premier, offering him advice, running the farm and  providing a good Christian home for Joh and the family. During those years, Florence would tour rural Queensland talking to different women's groups and rural people. She would take their views back to the Premier and then the Government would act on them. She was a most effective advocate for rural Australia because she went out there and listened to people, and when she came back all was fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980, at an age when most people look forward to retirement and looking after their grandchildren, Florence was called to run for the Senate. Many people, including many commentators and even some people in the National Party, thought that she would not be able to make the grade. Over the last 12 years she has proved them all wrong. She has made contributions on many Bills, asked many direct questions&mdash;as we heard today&mdash;and entered vigorously into debate. She has served as Acting Deputy President and, apart from an altercation with Senator Evans when he threatened to report her to the President, she has done it with style and decorum. She has also served for the last three months as Whip. Irrespective of what she has done in the Senate, she has earned the respect of every person in this chamber and in this Parliament. I have seen Labor senators come down here with absolute aggression towards the National Party and within a month Senator Bjelke-Petersen has had them eating out of her hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highest accolade that anyone can give to retiring senators is to say that they have represented their State well, and she has done that. Many times during her parliamentary career she has stood up for Queensland primary producers, whether the debate concerned wheat, wool or sugar. When primary industry needed her support, it could rely on her coming through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During her period as a senator, she travelled to the Torres Strait Islands. If they were having any particular problems, she was up there. I can recall one night when they had some problems and invited her up to Darnley Island, just off the Murray Islands. They had a feast, with traditional singing and dancing, and Florence was made ma ma&mdash;I think that was the term&mdash;or grandmother of the islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we are talking about the Torres Strait, western Queensland, the Gold Coast, the north coast or Brisbane, she has earned the respect of the people in those places. She has strongly supported family values. She believes fervently, as we do in the National Party, that the family is the basic tradition of Australia. Throughout Australia she has supported that, and throughout Queensland and Australia she is known for those values. The last three years have not been easy for Florence, but down here she has carried her burden well. I think she has earned the sympathy and the respect of all the people in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, Florence, is a sad day for the National Party. You have always been our exocet when it comes to campaigning.

I have to keep telling people that I still have another month or more as a senator, as we all have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel very pleased with the kind remarks that have been made, particularly by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans). We have had a vigorous rivalry in this chamber over the 15 years that he has been here. I do not suppose that life was all that much easier for a Minister in the Fraser Government before Senator Evans got here, but he helped to warm things up a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the way people see us is a bit out of perspective. Senator Evans has referred to the Costigan debates, during which he certainly gave me a hard time. I always felt that I was pretty good in giving back a hard time to him. In retrospect I can say that I rather enjoyed those debates. But there was much more to our debates over the years when I was Attorney-General than the Costigan debates. On many occasions, most of the debates, although vigorous, were positive and productive debates about important pieces of reform which in almost every case ultimately got through the Parliament&mdash;perhaps more to my liking than to his liking. Nevertheless, he and his colleagues made notable contributions to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the more vigorous debating that Senator Evans mentioned. Although Senator Tate is not here at the moment, I add for the record that he always made pretty effective contributions. Many times I listened more carefully to what he was saying than I did to Senator Evans. It did get a bit notorious that I was in an embattled state with Senator Tate and Senator Evans. At about that time, one member of my staff discovered a very new and very successful Western Australian wine known as Evans and Tate. He bought a few bottles of this wine and suggested that I present at least one of them to each of Senator Evans and Senator Tate. The wine has gone from strength to strength since then; I will leave it for others to judge the careers of Senator Evans and Senator Tate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly thank my leader Senator Hill for his warm valedictory speech to me. Senator Hill and I, in the twilight of my political career you might say, were very closely involved together in my resurrection as Deputy Leader of the Opposition for the two years 1990 to 1992. Although we naturally had quite a deal to do with each other over the years as colleagues, nevertheless we worked very closely and, I hope, very effectively during that period. I enjoyed those two years during which we worked together here in this chamber and that period was one of the highlights of my political career. I think during that period the Opposition worked together as a team better than it had ever done in its previous years either in government or in opposition&mdash;except perhaps during the Whitlam years when it was very difficult not to work as a team because of all the free kicks we were getting almost every day. I also thank Senator Boswell for his kind remarks and wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a speech made on a valedictory I think it is appropriate to thank a number of people other than those who proposed it. In particular of course, I would like to thank my wife, Isabel, and my two children, Anne and Philip, and their families for the great support I have had over the years. I came into politics much against the wishes of my family, including my parents, I might say, who thought politics was really beneath one's dignity. I do not accuse Isabel of thinking that; I think Isabel just thought that it was a pretty silly, stupid thing to do and that it would cause a lot of unnecessary inconvenience in our family life&mdash;which it has done. Therefore, I do thank her for her forbearance and I am delighted she is here in the gallery this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My two children I do not think have suffered at all from this trauma of their father in politics, even though I came into politics when they were teenagers. I think from their point of view they benefited very much from their father not being around during those years, and I probably benefited from not having to deal with them during that difficult period of their lives. But Isabel of course had to carry that extra burden. I have always been delighted with the great interest that my children have taken and still take in political life. Although it is unlikely perhaps that either of them will go into an active political career, I know they will still remain active in their interests and perhaps activities outside parliament in political affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group of people I would like to thank very much are my personal staff for their assistance over all the years I have been both a Senator and a Minister. I have been very lucky indeed with the quality of staff I have had working for me, and they have been an enormous support. I would like particularly to mention my two `personal assistants'&mdash;as I would refer to them rather than `personal secretaries'&mdash;and the personal assistance they gave me. I refer to Jan Keogh and in recent years Kathryn Carr. They have served me extremely well, and I am very grateful for their loyalty over all these years and through the difficult times that they have sometimes had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to express my great regard for the staff of the Senate and their help; in particular, the series of Senate clerks over the years. I will not mention them all but I must mention our present Clerk, Harry Evans, and Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, and thank them for the help they have been to me. I would also like to add specifically Rob Alison as another person who has been of great help, but all the Senate staff in one form or another have been of invaluable assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to mention the support staff there are in the Senate, and I will not mention them all. The attendants are perhaps the most obvious. I am pleased to see still a number of old faces amongst the attendants. When we came up here to the new House we seemed to be seeing new faces all the time, but was delighted that the attendant who brought me a glass of water before I rose to speak this afternoon is an old face and an old friend. So I do thank all the attendant staff we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group of people who have been of great help have been the drivers. I have had two drivers over the years personally assigned to me. In particular there was David Hoddell who drove me almost all the time I was a Minister and also for some of the period when we were in Opposition; and Rick Boyland who was my driver when I was resurrected, as I said, between 1990 and 1992. Both gave unstinting service and loyalty in that role. It is a very important role they perform for us when we are carrying these responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to spend a great deal of time going over my life in politics. I do not think this is a suitable occasion. It is certainly not one on which to publish a political will and testament. You will be pleased to know that I am not going to do that tonight, although I am thinking of doing one before 30 June and have to give some more thought to that. Perhaps I will also have to have regard to the law of defamation which I could escape if I published it tonight. But I think it would be unwise to use your forbearance tonight in speaking of very controversial matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have asked me over the years what it was that attracted me to politics, why I ever became a politician and so on. The answer is that I really do not know. I have been interested in politics ever since I was in senior class at school&mdash;not just my leaving class. I suppose it was perhaps the study of history which fascinated me and political history and economic history which perhaps got me interested. But of course my attraction to a particular political cause, namely that of the Liberal Party, was clearly due to my great admiration for Sir Robert Menzies. The foundation of the Liberal Party in 1944 came at an impressionable time for me when I was just a first year university student. I had my first taste of political life in helping to form the university Liberal club at UWA in the middle of 1945. My interest in politics from that time onwards has never flagged and I do not think it ever will, even when I leave here. Although I do not plan to be active in a political sphere at all after my retirement, I will continue to remain closely interested in political affairs and what is going on, even in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have felt during my political career that there are some fundamental reasons why I had become a Liberal in the first place, why I was attracted to the Liberal Party. It was essentially for two reasons: firstly, that I have always had a very sceptical view of what governments can achieve. I guess that is why I never bought socialism as an undergraduate, which was a fairly natural and attractive proposition, but I have always had that scepticism. Even as a Minister when I believe we were too active in trying to fix up everything in life by public action, public decisions, nevertheless, I feel more proud in many ways of some of the decisions I did not take, refused to take, as a Minister than those I did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major motivation I have had in political life has been to try to expand and improve the rights of individuals, and that was the belief that was very much behind my role as Attorney-General. I do not propose to speak for very long about my career before coming into the Federal Parliament and into this Senate. Life in the State Parliament of Western Australia for three years was well and truly long enough and I was pleased when the electors decided to make me a oncer. For the following three years I had a more agreeable time as State President of the Liberal Party. I enjoyed that period very much, although it was a rather demanding one when I was also trying to make a living at the Western Australian bar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was when I came into this chamber 22 years ago that I first really found my feet, so to speak, and what I felt my appropriate role. I realise that the selectors in one form or another in the Western Australian Liberal Party were quite right in selecting me for the Senate because I do believe that this is where I was able to make a greater contribution than if I had gone into the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into the Senate at a most important time for this chamber because in 1971 it was just starting to get moving on the new committee system. There had been some committees before that, but the new committee system had just begun when I came into the Senate. I believe this has been the most outstanding achievement for parliamentary reform and reinvigoration, not only in Australia but in other parliamentary systems. It was no doubt modelled on the American committee system and the vigour that that contributed to democratic life in the United States. It was a great reform for our parliamentary institution and it has gone from strength to strength. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the estimates committees and the work they have done. I know it is very irksome for Ministers, but those of you who have enjoyed the benefit of asking questions of Ministers and pressing Ministers will realise that what is good for the goose is good for the gander. It is most important that the Public Service has that pressure put on it to respond&mdash;and it has responded handsomely to that challenge and is much better for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of committee work which must be developed further and which is vitally important for the future is the system of sending Bills for scrutiny before the so-called Friday committees. I think such committees must be expanded from just sitting on Fridays only. Maybe some Bills can be dealt with in a day but others need much greater time. All those in the electorate interested in what we are doing, all those who in many cases have a major personal interest in what we are doing with legislation should have that opportunity&mdash;indeed, an even greater opportunity than they have now. That again is a major plus for the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We lost government in 1983 and the ensuing 10 years have been long, hard, frustrating and disappointing. They have not, however, all been negative. Certainly senators on this side of the chamber are all heartily sick of being in opposition, and I hope we will not be in opposition for very much longer. However, the work which has been done over the years in the development of our policies, under successive leaders with a great team effort on the part of so many on this side of the chamber, has been most important. When we come into government those efforts will be most important in making a good, sound government for the betterment of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were in opposition between 1972 and 1975, we were just so overwhelmed with the daily free kicks we were getting and the use that we were able to make of them in both chambers that our time was largely taken up with tactical matters from day to day. We certainly did not devote sufficient time to policy development, to updating and developing policy to meet the challenges of the day, but that has not been the case in the last 10 years. I emphasise that something very positive has come out of what seems to have been a very frustrating period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going into retirement without regret. I was not terribly happy about the circumstances that led to my decision not to contest the last election. As I said, I will have something to say about that in other forums on other occasions. I had hoped&mdash;and expected&mdash;that we would win the last election. I would have liked to have had a crack at another short time in government; I certainly have no desire to spend any further time in opposition. I feel very happy to pass the torch to my colleagues. They are now well trained and well disciplined&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;in the role of opposition, but they are well suited to continuing to fight the good fight. I trust that at the next election they will be back in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud to have been a politician for 28 years. I do not believe that this role deserves the disparagement of so many people. It is a career and a professional life of great importance&mdash;probably the greatest. In a democratic country, it is the greatest and most important profession that anyone could take up. The work we do is in most cases selfless in the sense that we are always thinking of the best policies for Australia. We differ on these policies very widely, but there is enormous common ground in both chambers about the right policy to pursue. We concentrate on those areas where differences lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long as we as Australians can make the most use of our parliamentary democracy and our democratic life generally, I have no doubt that Australia will get out of its present problems and return to the prosperity it had known for so many past decades. I have the greatest belief in Australia and Australians. I do not have any doubts about what it is to be an Australian. We have very clear identities and clear basic philosophies about how life should be conducted, how we should be governed, and how we should be defended. It is with a great feeling of satisfaction that I leave political life with this very firm and hopeful belief about the future of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall of course miss being involved in parliamentary politics. I still care about policy and issues, the Labor Party and Australia but I am too old and/or too tired to apply myself properly to constituency or parliamentary duties. The pinnacle of my personal political ambition was reached during the five years I was Minister for Finance. The most satisfying and significant period of my life was the period I spent working with that excellent department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into the Senate with strong and long held beliefs about a fair society, and the importance of economic efficiency in achieving one, civil liberty, conscription, capital punishment and a belief that I could make an important contribution to agricultural policy, an area in which the Labor Party had long been ignorant and confused. The Country Party, which I despised, was in that respect worse. Its ignorance was compounded by a propensity to protect its electoral base as an end in itself. Its policies were not beneficial to either the nation or most of the farmers it purported to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 15 years or so, and with the partial exception of the sugar industry, all that has changed considerably. The old system of treating the welfare needs of a minority of farmers with costly and inevitably ineffective across-the-board budget and consumer subsidies has almost disappeared from both sides of politics. Even the National Party has now followed mostly the lead that Labor gave. The first significant Labor politician to take a serious interest in sensible agricultural policy was Bill Hayden at the 1971 Federal conference. I would like to believe that I played an important role in the late 1970s and 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All, of course, is not well in Australian agriculture today but it would be worse had the shibboleths of the earlier period not been swept aside. We&mdash;that is, the Labor Government&mdash;made a serious error of omission in the late 1980s, allowing wool industry agro-politicians to use the Commonwealth's taxing and fiscal guarantee powers to accumulate the stockpile. There are early but ominous signs that a similar coalition will again misuse taxing power in cargo cultist pursuit of value adding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1974 I genuinely had no ministerial ambitions. I believed the then Ministers, and possibly even their opposition shadows, were more experienced, astute and competent than I could ever hope to be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adjustment from wheat farmer to politician, aggravated by the speed with which the 1974 double dissolution caused it to happen, was not easy. Indeed, I remember in late 1974 reading Toffler's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Future Shock </EMPHASIS>while also experiencing it. I seriously contemplated giving politics away. That was turned around sharply by the Opposition perpetrated events of 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1972-75 Labor Government was not a particularly good one. In its last months, largely because of Hayden's appointment as Treasurer, it was better than it had been but there is no serious doubt that it would have been removed from office in the proper way and at the proper time. It, of course, would have been removed from office at the end of 1975 in the proper way and at the proper time had the opportunistic Opposition not forced the premature 1974 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in 1975 the Opposition just could not wait. No lie was too big, no tactic was too sleazy, no risk, including the risk of civil disorder, was too great if it facilitated the return of what it regarded as its birthright.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the 1974 election, the eligibility of the Victorian Country Party senator, James Webster, to sit in the Senate was challenged under section 44(v) of the Constitution. This section disqualifies anyone who:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Barwick anointed himself to sit solely as a court of disputed returns to determine the challenge. He found that Webster was eligible because no evidence had been produced to suggest that Webster had used his position as a senator to secure the contracts. That was indeed so but it had nothing to do with the charge&mdash;the fact that the contracts existed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not doing this lightly. I believe that there are historical facts that ought to be put on the record. I am sorry that Senator Hill or some of his colleagues might be offended by it. The High Court judgments of the 1970s laid the foundations for the notorious bottom-of-the-harbour tax evasion schemes. Those who deplore the extreme length of the present Act should remember that it is a legacy of those Barwick judgments. Once commonsense and clear intention had been suspended by a High Court dedicated to finding pseudo-legal excuses for tax evasion, every conceivable matter of detail and process had to be closed off by black letter law. It is pretty cheeky for former High Court judges who supported Barwick in the 1970s to be sanctimonious now about the extreme length of the taxation Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Barwick's commitment to eroding the Commonwealth tax base was not mirrored by his attitude to spending public money&mdash;at least not when expenditure was directed towards his indulgence and self-aggrandisement. He is personally credited with adding some $15 million, in 1970s dollars, to the cost of the High Court building. His plans to spend a few million more to establish Lanyon Homestead as the chief justice's palace were ultimately thwarted by Malcolm Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His personal aversion to paying tax was `outed' by the Mundroola affair. Mundroola was a family company set up, like most such family companies, to minimise tax by splitting income without surrendering control. In 1980, it was revealed by a search of the corporate affairs records that no company return had been lodged with the New South Wales CAC since 1974. The return listed Sir Garfield Barwick as director, and at that time&mdash;at least until 1981&mdash;he occupied a company house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax law was quite clear: if he had paid rent to the company, that must be recorded in the company tax return as income; if he did not, he, as a company director, must include imputed rent as income in his personal tax return.

Therefore, what is being said on this occasion under privilege by Senator Walsh is not only sad and a reflection on him but also clearly out of order under that provision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Evans, among others, will remember, the facts provoked considerable debate in the Parliament and considerable speculation about the contents of one or both tax returns. The ATO, as it now is, was prohibited by section 16 from making either available. But that prohibition did not apply to the taxpayer. Anyway, after the debate had raged for some time, Barwick's letter of resignation from the Mundroola board fortuitously appeared&mdash;dated 1974.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Labor was elected in 1983, my firm belief was that we would be in office for at least two terms, partly because the coalition had been thoroughly discredited and partly because, unlike in 1972 and 1974, the coalition had accepted the legitimacy of Labor's victory. I believe that the most important subsequent election was in 1987. The coalition was then still committed to reversing the just and necessary reforms to the tax system and to the Budget outlays which had been pursued in the mid to late 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1987 victory confounded the pre-existing conventional wisdom that a government which actually practised fiscal responsibility, closed tax loopholes, desisted&mdash;mostly&mdash;from pork-barrelling and cut perks to the affluent could not survive an election. After 1987, I believed that Australia's political culture had been permanently changed. Now I am not so sure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor inherited a sick economy in 1983. For the rest of the 1980s, progress was made in reducing unemployment, fostering economic growth and, to a lesser extent, reducing inflation. For the first time ever, the Commonwealth Budget was in surplus. Although outlays as a proportion of GDP came down by nearly six percentage points, the needs of the poor, of the lowest quintile, were more effectively addressed than ever before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the chattering class mantra, it was, at least until 1989, a very proper Labor Government in the traditional sense. But productivity growth was poor and nominal wage increases too high. Partly because of that, partly because of an inadequate level of private saving and partly because of the inflation and tax related asset price boom of the late 1980s, the current account deficit was not brought under control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, that brought the Government's economic strategy undone, and the policy response to the 1989 current account deficit blow-out&mdash;interest rates of 20 per cent plus&mdash;ushered in the present recession. The current account deficit is not under control now and, on present indications, is not likely to be in the near future, even if the economy continues to wallow in the trough of sluggish growth and high or slowly rising unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a small but very noisy group which says that many things are more important than economic growth. Almost inevitably, these people display the following attributes: they have jobs&mdash;usually well paid; they are either on the public tit or have secure jobs in the semi-public sector; they are vociferous demanders of more government services and handouts to their own pet causes; and they are opponents of higher taxes, or at least higher taxes on themselves and their cronies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their stars often appear on television. One recently asserted that, if we do not have enough money for all the worthy causes, then we just have to find it. `Oh for a magic pudding'. Another participated in a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> discussion on Australia's destiny and place in the world. Geoffrey Blainey observed that, unless we fairly quickly overcame our economic problems, Australia was destined for mediocrity and insignificance. The reply was, `I could not disagree with that more'. Obviously, to such people long-term economic decline is not regarded as a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The million or so Australians who do not have a job, and who, a bit of churning aside, have no chance of getting one unless growth is high, disagree. But who cares about them? Certainly not those in comfortable public sector sinecures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who disagree so violently with the proposal that economic growth matters to the future of Australia might reflect on how many banana republics or countries in long-term decline are important, respected or influential in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some of that group, the unemployment issue is evaded by claiming that economic growth is not a prerequisite to more jobs. All we need, according to them, is `green' jobs. While that is technically feasible, the advocates are too ignorant to understand&mdash;or too dishonest to acknowledge&mdash;that the quid pro quo for these green jobs is a big fall in real wages&mdash;something which they would oppose more vehemently than most, at least if it applied to themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each of the three Australian recessions in the last 18 years has lifted unemployment to a higher plateau with a commensurate increase in long-term unemployment. This has also happened in most other countries, but our difficulties are compounded, and our chance of real recovery diminished, by our chronic current account deficit. That the Governor-General's speech paid so little attention to those problems is disappointing; that it pandered so much to sectional interest and pressure groups, which will aggravate them, I find alarming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that Ben Chifley's Labor Party, to which I made a personal commitment more than 40 years ago, has lost its way&mdash;and mouthing Chifley rhetoric is a poor substitute for sharing his beliefs, especially his belief that economic growth, or development as he would have called it, has a paramount role in improving the life of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does anyone believe that Ben Chifley would have closed down mines and banned exploration in a sequence of highly prospective mineral provinces, not for any serious environmental reason but to appease the secular religious sanctimony of Balmain basketweavers? Would Chifley have allowed the long-footed potoroo, or whatever fad was in vogue with the chattering classes, to take priority over a million unemployed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who stultify growth always ensure that others bear the cost. This is profoundly unfair. Moreover, and perhaps even worse, we are entitled to question whether liberal democracy, which I trust we all cherish, can survive long-term economic decline and falling incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Periodically, most recently earlier this month, journalists have labelled me as an old-fashioned Labor man&mdash;left wing on income distribution, right wing on social issues. I do not mind being called old fashioned, but I dispute the description of being right wing on social issues. On social issues I am generally a libertarian, which is why I am contemptuous of bourgeois left authoritarian social engineers who have much more in common with the Calvinistic right than they do with left liberalism. They are the people who have not read or have not understood, or who have rejected, John Stuart Mill's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">On Liberty</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years I have made many friends among journalists, but I believe most political journalists have failed to discharge their fundamental responsibility to the public: to accurately report facts and rigorously analyse conclusions. There is, particularly in Canberra, an alarmingly short and shallow knowledge of political and economic history. All journalists should follow the lead of their independent colleagues: wean themselves from government or other drips and from the implicit obligation to run the government line. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, they should apply themselves much more to the substance of issues and much less to the theatre or entertainment of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to thank the other speakers for the kind things they have said. There may be fewer kind things said in the future, over the next hour or two. I also want to thank my family for the support they have given me. At least two of my children, like Senator Durack's parents, were not at all happy when I became a politician&mdash;nor for that matter were my parents, particularly as by that stage they thought I was going in on the wrong side. I want to thank my party for giving me a parliamentary career and all of the people who have worked for me, for other politicians or for the Labor Party per se who have played a major role in helping me to fulfil that career. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One moment that I treasure&mdash;I am sure Senator Crowley will remember this&mdash;arose one night on the adjournment. It was not long after Senator Newman came into the Senate. Senator Grimes was giving her a particularly hard time on the likelihood of her being able to get a pension when she left this place. I had my turn and I was really getting stuck into Don Grimes. He told me that my behaviour was the result of my having had a very good dinner and that I was drunk.

I am not too much of a sook, but I just feel that women senators should have a Com driver to take them home. I was told that the Black Rod had said, `No Com drivers'. I am sorry, Black Rod. The secretary said to me, `Senator, I'll come home with you in the taxi'. I said, `Really, I'll be fine'. I suppose I was trying to make a point. I do believe that particularly the female senators need the security going home late at night, and the Com drivers are fantastic. They always wait till I get inside. I have lived in a couple of places that have been a bit dicey. I have gone round the back of the house. That sounds a bit wrong. You know, it is a bit dark. They will wait till you are in. They give you all the assurance under the sun that they are there for your security. I really do appreciate the 18 years that they have looked after me so well. </PARA>

I think that is working remarkably well, despite the fight that we had to set it up.

The Government that had been in for 17 years lost power just before the conference with the result that a new Prime Minister came in to find out that his first task was to Chair this conference. So the conference duly opened with pomp and ceremony. The new Prime Minister was explaining how the rules of debate would take place and a very familiar voice yelled out, `Point of order, Mr President!'. I must say, I jumped to attention.

I had intended to make a very brief valedictory speech, but I regret to tell the Senate that Senator Walsh, with his comments about 1975, has provoked me to expand on my speech a little.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The years of the Second World War had a very deep influence on me, as they did on Senator Walters. I think I was about seven when the war started and 12 when it finished. Children of such tender years certainly are deeply influenced by their perception of the events of the day. I was a dedicated patriot who knew many of the servicemen who were killed or came home wounded. I mostly heard them telling their families the funny stories about what had happened, not talking about the sad things and the pain they had suffered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was determined to be a pilot. My great ambition in life was to be a fighter pilot. I ultimately achieved that ambition. I was a fighter pilot in 21 Squadron of the Citizens Air Force, and I was very proud of that. Like Senator Walsh, Mr Chifley was a hero of mine and I saw the light on the hill that Mr Chifley talked about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was an only child in a Labor family. I was born and bred in Richmond and we were all Labor people in Richmond. The Liberal Party was for people who lived in Toorak. The wealthy people supported the Liberal Party and we all supported the Labor Party, except for one uncle of mine who was a foreman in a steel factory. I could not understand that, because he was really the only genuine labourer that I knew. My father was quite a wealthy merchant. I remember Uncle Cec was the only genuine labourer that I knew and he was a great supporter of the Liberal Party. I asked him on a number of occasions why, and on each occasion he said that he would never forget what the Labor Party did to us in the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That did not mean anything to me at the time. However, I subsequently came to understand what he was talking about. I was far too young to appreciate Sir Robert Menzies and, unfortunately, I was too young to do what my colleague Senator Durack did and that was be associated with the Liberal Party when I got to university. As I said, my father was a dedicated member of the Australian Labor Party and he sought and held office in the local branch. He ran the local branch, was a councillor for the city of Richmond and on three occasions was mayor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1950s, when I was at Melbourne University, the Labor Party split. It was unbelievable what was going on. While I was flying and doing things like that at weekends, it seemed that all the other university students could talk about was politics and people stabbing other people in the back. It did not matter which side of politics they were on, they were always talking about being stabbed in the back. So I proceeded to opt out of politics and in 1956 I even opted out of the city of Melbourne and got a job at Warrnambool, 300 kilometres away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the 1960s, there was a fellow named Sir Henry Bolte who was governing Victoria and governing it very well on most occasions. From time to time I used to get very angry about some of the things he said and did. I remember being very angry about capital punishment, which I think is totally wrong. The state should not be entitled to take anyone's life in the same way as no-one else should be entitled to take anyone's life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party was doing quite well but there were a number of things it was doing that were not quite right. I used to talk to one of the local members down there, a fellow by the name of Sir Ronald Mack, who subsequently became the Speaker of the Upper House of the Victorian Parliament. He was then the Minister for Health. He said to me, `Why don't you join the Liberal Party and then you will be able to push the changes that you want and make it a better party'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1960s I came to see that there was some merit in that course and I adopted it. My father was absolutely staggered. He could not believe that his son had become a member of the Liberal Party and he dared not tell any of his friends about it. Like any young lawyer in a country town who takes an active interest in the community, I suddenly found myself rising through the party ranks and becoming the branch president. I had previously been the branch secretary and the organiser for the campaigns for the electorates of Warrnambool, the member being Ian Smith, and Wannon, the member being a fellow named Malcolm Fraser. I ran their campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1972 my father was absolutely delighted with the result of the election. I was surprised that it was such a strong result in favour of the Labor Party. I remember going to my opposite number Gerry Hand, who was running the Labor Party campaign in Warrnambool, congratulating him and wishing him well for the term of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1975 it was unbelievable what had happened to this nation. My father said to me, `I knew they were crook down here, but I did not understand that it went right through the Labor Party to the top in Canberra'. I say to Senator Walsh that that was the attitude of many people around Australia. They could not believe that the Labor Party was crook. Crooked was what they meant. They did not just mean that Labor was governing badly, but that there was an element of crookedness which really worried them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh said, and this is part of the shibboleth of the Labor Party, that if Fraser had only waited the Liberals would have won office legitimately in due course. That is nonsense. Has he forgotten that Mr Whitlam was about to call a half Senate election and has he not seen the Labor Party's ability to manipulate the media? We have seen it in the last three elections. Dare he forget what Mr Wran did for the media with regard to Lotto. Let there be no doubt that once the Labor Party sets itself up to remain in office it will pull any trick, it will tell any lie&mdash;the bigger the lie the better&mdash;and it will manipulate its sycophants in the gallery in order to remain there. Those sycophants have been to university and have no practical knowledge of what goes on in real life. They leave university with some sort of degree and join the cynical force of the press gallery and then think they know all that there is to know about it. They do not understand the manipulations and devious arrangements that go on underneath. I feel as angry about what the Labor Party has done to this country as Senator Walsh feels about what Sir Garfield Barwick may have done to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleague Senator Shirley Walters, I am concerned about the future of this nation at present. I think it is desperate. I think the fact that the Prime Minister, today simply cancelled Question Time in the House of Representatives is an indication that our democratic institutions are falling apart under the Labor Party. Democracy is something which is very precious and hard to get and it must be held onto. I am very concerned about what the Government is doing. We know that Senator Evans came into this place with the objective of getting rid of the Senate. He has never said that he has since changed his mind, so one must presume that he continues to want the abolition of the Senate. Where would we be, so far as democracy is concerned in Australia, without the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other place has become simply a place of manipulation of numbers and no debate. In fact, whatever debate takes place takes place in the Caucus and in the Caucus committees. Most of that, from what I can gather, takes place as a result of various factions within the party making up their minds what they can do, so that `If you have this, I will have that';  `You take this trip and I will take that trip'; `You get onto this committee and we will get onto that committee'; or `You become the chairman of this and we will become the chairman of that'. That is not what government is all about. It is certainly not what parliamentary democracy is all about. Without the Senate at present there would be no parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move away from my reaction to Senator Walsh's remarks; I will move on to what I hope are more pleasant subjects. In 1976 I surprised myself, and certainly my wife, by winning the position to replace the late Senator Ivor Greenwood, who I might say was a very powerful and able senator. My wife said she had married a solicitor, not a politician. I can only say to her that I regret that I did not perhaps stay a solicitor. If I had stayed a solicitor I have no doubt that I would by now be a millionaire, as the owner of a woollen mill. However, that little business venture, which with hindsight would have been extremely successful, fell by the bye and in December of 1976 I became a senator for the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that day, 7 December, I was sworn in. Up until then my life had been my own. If I wanted to have a haircut, I simply said to my secretary, `Put me out between 3.30 and 4.00; I am going for a haircut', and I went out for a haircut. On 7 December 1976 I was sworn into the Senate in the presence of my wife and family. At about 20 past four I said to them, `We will have to get you out to the airport now because the plane goes at five. I will just get a car and take you out'. I was walking around to the side of the old place with my wife and family to get a Senate car to go out to the airport when these bells started to ring, and for the first time I realised that I had no right to walk out of the building. For the first time in my life, as far as I could recall, I was bound by rules which required me to be in this place all the time and to answer these bells. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say to Labor senators&mdash;this might even surprise Democrat senators&mdash;that when we were in government and I was on the back bench, as far as I was concerned that meant that I asked the Ministers the toughest questions I could think of. I really do not understand how the Labor Party backbenchers can continually ask dorothy dixers; it is beyond me. I used to think of the most difficult questions. I would have lunch with Margaret Guilfoyle and I would not warn her what I was going to ask her. I would come into the Parliament, get the first question and go whack, straight at Margaret Guilfoyle with an extraordinarily difficult question. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Margaret would say to me, `Why do you do that?'. I would say, `Isn't that our role?  Our role is to keep the Ministers on the ball, to keep them going, to keep them up-front. This is a difficult question. The public are entitled to know the answer to it'. I remember that I used to get very cross. I see a stranger&mdash;get out of the place!; my local member, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just do not know what has happened to Question Time. In those days, as a backbencher on the government side, I got a question every day. If I was quick I could get a second question. By leaping up at the end of the day I would get two questions every day, and the toughest questions I could think of.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I am very proud of is the fact that I came forward with the idea of financial impact statements. I came forward with the idea that every time the Government introduced a Bill it would put down a financial impact statement. I did not just mean the cost to revenue; what I meant was what the cost to the community would be. The reason I did that was that I was so angry over metrication and what metrication had cost this nation. The change across from pounds, shillings and pence to dollars and cents had gone so well and had been so successful that people just took metrication and said, `Oh, it will be all right'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, it cost the nation hundreds of millions of dollars. For what? To find out that, instead of living 163 miles from Melbourne, I lived 300 kilometres from Melbourne. What difference does it make? I still will never be able to work out what air pressure I am supposed to have in the tyres of the car, and I do not know anyone who can. And for what?  We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this. People used to say to me, `It is so that scientists will be able to work in metric numbers'. That is rubbish. We used to be able to buy 25 feet of 8mm film and no-one ever got upset about that or did not understand what you were buying when you asked for movie film. What difference does it make if you now buy two metres or four metres of it, instead of 25 or 50 feet? It is an absolutely ridiculous waste of money. </PARA>

I congratulate the Labor Party for it, although the Labor Party has not really carried it out to the full extent in that every Bill has a financial impact statement but only in regard to the cost to the Treasury, not the cost to the nation. It is really the cost to the nation that bothers me. I might say to the Democrats that since then I have from time to time  mooted the idea that what ought to be produced in addition to a financial impact statement is an environmental impact statement, detailing the cost to the environment of legislation which is introduced.</PARA></TALK.START>

He was with me for 13 years and then he had to retire because of age. I brought him back for the last three months to help me clean up the office.

I might be doing the wrong thing by him by mentioning his name here tonight, but when he went back to the Public Service you did not leave him at the position that he should have been at, you put him down below that position, and you have not promoted him in the way that he should have been promoted. I think he has finally started to receive some recognition of his brilliance. He is a brilliant and unbiased adviser. I do not think he was a supporter of the Liberal Party; I think he joined me simply as an adviser. I add that I am quite certain that my secretary of 14 years, Joan Bosch, was certainly not a supporter of the Liberal Party. I had many other secretaries and other staff who did very well for me.

But it is not just them, it is the other staff as well: the attendants and the people around the chamber who provide us with service while we are in the chamber, and all the other staff. The committee secretariats are brilliant. I must say that I really did enjoy my term of service on the Senate regulations and ordinances committee&mdash;a marvellous committee. When we get into government, we will make the scrutiny of bills committee as important as the Senate regulations and ordinances committee. How it is that members of the Labor Party just allow that committee to slip by is beyond me.

In particular, I thank my Liberal Party colleagues; my Whips, Margaret, and Sue, and now John; and my leaders. I have had some brilliant leaders. Reg Withers was a marvellous leader.

I am sure that all senators here would acknowledge the tremendous support and hard work of their spouses without whom, I believe, a politician's lot would be untenable. We have heard various senators here this evening saying that. I believe it is almost a case of `Buy one, get one free', and that is exactly what it is. So it is with me, because I married a backbencher in the Queensland Parliament and basically knew what I was letting myself in for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still remember going to New Zealand on my honeymoon and I got this letter asking me if I would go and open a fete in Murgon. It was only a small thing, but I nearly died of fright because I had always been careful never to be a president or a vice president in case I had to make a speech. I did all the secretarial work of all the organisations I was in. I looked at this letter and said to Joh with fear and trembling, `What will I do? They want me to open a fete'. `Oh' said Joh, `You go'&mdash;and there was method in his madness because I have never stopped going from that day until now, I might say. </PARA>

So by the time I was elected to the Senate I had experienced many, many years of being the one you got for free. Somebody once asked me what the difference was between being a Premier's wife and a senator. I said, `Well, I get paid now for what I used to do for nothing'. But I did find out that, from being a premier's wife whom everybody treated with great respect and were always glad to see, when you came to the Senate you were certainly very humble. But that had nothing to do with it at all. You were just an ordinary backbench senator. Well, I suppose it sort of put me in my place fairly well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, for a number of years I was still the Premier's wife and a senator.

However, when I was no longer the Premier's wife I found that the invitation list got very much smaller. So I decided that the reason I got all those invitations was not because I was such a wonderful senator; it was because I was the wife of the Premier. </PARA>

Of course, as I look back on the 13 years I had in the Main Roads Department when I typed estimates for many numbers of years&mdash;and I was in Main Roads during the war years where we used to have to work terribly late at night doing all these estimates for the jobs that the Americans wanted built&mdash;I remember how eventually I became the secretary to the Main Roads Commissioner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have certainly also been an advocate of lower taxes. I have tried, during the hundreds and hundreds of speeches I have given and in the questions I have asked and the representations I have made, to keep these issues firmly on the Government's agenda.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that when I made my maiden speech in the Senate on 6 May 1981, I spoke of the need then for a single rate of tax. I still believe that if my suggestion had been adopted, Australia would be in a better financial position today. Certainly, according to the Auditor-General, when you think that Australia has more than $125 billion in debts and only $57 billion available in liquid assets to meet those debts, well, there is no doubt that a single rate of tax would have been better than what we have now. I think our children and our grandchildren certainly want us to do better than we have been doing recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke all around Australia at that time about overhauling our nefarious taxation system that we had in those early days. You could say that my advocacy fell on deaf ears&mdash;although there was one occasion when I thought I had at last made them see reason. I was sitting in my room one day, I got a knock on the door and a letter was delivered to me. The letter asked me if I would go and have a cup of tea with John Howard, who was Treasurer at the time, as he would like to discuss with me my single rate of tax&mdash;I think we called it the `flat tax' at that time. So off I went, knocked on the door and his secretary came out and said, `What I can do for you?'. I thought it was rather funny and said, `Well, look, I've got a letter here asking me to come and have a cup of tea with John Howard'. She said, `Oh, just a minute', and rushed and got John Howard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When John Howard came to the door, he looked at me and said, `What can I do for you, Florence?'.

It is the first of April'. So I fell rather flat on my face. I thought, `Well, that's a fine ending to this story'. But, never mind, he took me in, gave me a cup of tea, and let us say we talked about all sorts of things except the single rate of tax. But I am nothing if not persistent for I still believe that if our tax system were simplified vis-a-vis a single rate of taxation, Australia would be in a better financial position today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have just mentioned, I came to the Senate when the Liberal-National Party coalition was in power. I made an early name for myself as a renegade when I crossed the floor to vote against the Government over the `necessities of life' tax issue. Needless to say, I was sent to Coventry where I had plenty of time to contemplate the ramifications of my actions. I do not regret crossing the floor over this issue, for I believe it helped me to communicate to the people of Queensland that I was prepared to go in and do battle for them if I truly believed that what I was doing was right. And I know that there were a number of others on my side of parliament, even down to the right there, who at different times have crossed the floor for things they thought were right. I look at Dr Herron here who crossed the floor about tobacco issues and things like that. However, I did learn that if you want people to keep on talking to you, it is best to signal your intentions beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably for us, we became the opposition in 1983, and so for 10 years now I have served as an Opposition senator. During that time I have been a Temporary Chairman of Committees, a job which I have enjoyed. I want to thank the Deputy President, who is in the chair this evening, for the nice letter he wrote me thanking me for the work that I had done. I always enjoyed it. Now and again I got into a few spots of hot water here and there. I recall that the Leader of the Government once disputed a ruling and wrote to the President. I had said to him, `Well, if you don't agree, you can write to the President'&mdash;so he did. But I did not actually get hauled over the coals; that was all right. </PARA>

I do want to pay tribute here to my friends Margaret and Sue. During the times when Senator Brownhill was over at the United Nations working very hard, I relieved him for a while and had the great pleasure of getting to know both Margaret and Sue very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that John Panizza, the present Deputy Whip, is the most obliging person when it comes to doing a little bit of duty in the Whips chair for me.

The work which is done in the committee system is very important to the overall effectiveness of this place. I know that many senators give a great deal of their time to this function of the Senate. Apart from its obvious import, I have also found the committees to be a very good means of communicating with fellow senators and members across party lines. I personally think this is very desirable and I have made many friends from all parties during my committee work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most fascinating aspects of life in politics is the recognition factor, and I guess I have had my share of this. I would like to think it is not just because of my much publicised culinary expertise that I have been recognised here, there and everywhere. I recall one particularly funny incident when I was overseas, in Chester, England. I had gone to church;  we were coming out of church and we shook hands with the Minister who said, `Where do you come from?'. I said, `I come from Australia'. He said, `The couple who have just gone come from Australia too'. Just at that particular time they looked around, and the wife came over to me and she stared at me; she kept on staring at me. She said, `Oh, you do look like Flo'. I said, `Well, I am Flo'. `Oh', she said, `Do you mind if I give you a kiss?'. I said, `Oh, no'. Better still, the husband came up and gave me one too, so that was extra nice. But it was funny&mdash;a year or two later I went to a National Party meeting in Orange and who should be there but the said lady and her husband, so I guess that was perhaps a part of the attraction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, the recognition factor can also work the other way. I recall being in Norway on one occasion where I met a lass who came up to speak to me, my sister and a friend, and we all exchanged our names. I told her that my name was Florence and I came from Queensland. She looked at me with horror in her face and she said, `Florence&mdash;that is a handicap of a name in Queensland, isn't it?'. I was really taken aback and my friend Claire said, `Oh, that is the Florence that you are talking to'. So, I suppose it is lucky that I have a good sense of humour and that that never worried me. In fact, it has made a jolly good story which I tell at some of my meetings around the countryside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Senate is an essential part of the balance of power, built into the Constitution to protect against unbridled power wielded by the majority view expressed in the House of Representatives. I know there is a certain section in politics which would like to see the Senate abolished&mdash;and that, I believe, is the Labor Party. Also, in Mr Whitlam's time, they were talking about abolishing the States. I know this, because Joh went over to England with all the other premiers of the States of Australia&mdash;Labor Party people and I think Sir Rupert Hamer and also Robert Askin. They all went together to see Sir Alec Douglas-Home who was the Minister in charge of overseas countries. They said that they did not want to have the States abolished, nor did they want to become a republic. Whatever Alec Douglas-Home said, they came back and nothing more was said. But the next time Joh came down for a premiers conference, he met Mr Whitlam who said, `Joh, you might have won the first round, but let me tell you that I am going to be the first president of the republic'. Joh, I think, said much what you said, Senator O'Chee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland's Mr Goss, for one, feels the Senate is just a talkfest and not really a States house at all. I recently said on television that I believe one of the most important parts of the Senate's work is as a house of review and much time is spent in this place trying to improve legislation passed by the House of Representatives, I might say to my House of Representatives friends over there&mdash;although I do admit that our work is often thwarted because of the Democrats' tendency to side with the Labor Party. However, I believe the Senate is a very important part of our system of government, and I strongly support the maintenance of such a system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the National Party in Queensland for giving me the opportunity of standing for the Senate and I thank the people of Queensland for supporting me so well over the past 12 years. In the 1987 double dissolution election, I was chosen to lead the National Party team and we returned four senators on that occasion. Regrettably, when I leave, Queensland will be represented by only two National Party senators, but I know that they will continue to represent Queensland and the National Party well. Senator Ron Boswell has been a great fighter for Queensland in the area of small business and rural matters and, no doubt, will continue with this good work. Senator O'Chee, who calls me his grandmother, is the youngest senator in this place; he is a very able speaker and debater. The National Party can be proud of his work, and I look forward to watching his progress after I leave. </PARA>

There has been much talk of late about the need for more female representation in the national capital, and this was an opportunity for the people of Queensland to elect an extremely capable woman to the Senate. De-Anne is an electrical engineer, a mother and a farmer, and would have made a valuable contribution to the workings of the Senate. It is regrettable, to say the least, that she failed to achieve the necessary quota to ensure her election. </PARA>

They do not talk at all about the three Labor people who were on the jury. I cannot understand that. Another thing I cannot understand is&mdash;and Senator Hill, as a lawyer, would know&mdash;why did the prosecution not challenge the selection of Luke Shaw?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We both went to the same university, so maybe we were brainwashed at the same time about these things. That was a long overdue reform. The introduction of the capital gains tax helped drag Australia's tax system into the 20th century. We basically had a 19th century tax system until the mid 1980s. The capital gains tax was certainly a very important element in bringing fairness and equity to our tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that when I came here the Australian economy was basically a quarry and a farm. Our export proceeds essentially came from rural products, either in mining or from growing crops and exporting them. They are very important industries now&mdash;they always will be&mdash;but we have seen over that 10-year period a diversification of the Australian economy towards value adding in the manufacturing sector. A now very large and growing area of our export proceeds is generated by manufactured products and, most importantly, by elaborately transformed manufactured products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also pleased to be here at the time when perhaps the most major revisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act  occurred&mdash;the period 1983-84. The Act dates from 1918. Perhaps the most major changes since that time occurred at a very privileged time for me in the early 1980s. I was pleased to be a very small part of that process of bringing in major reforms to voting procedures in Australia. One of them was to ensure that more Australians could cast valid votes. We had the situation prior to those reforms where, in some parts of Australia, one-fifth of all voters voted informally because they simply could not get past a ballot paper with 78 or 74 names on it. That was one of the many reforms that came in during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also very pleased to have a small role in helping give more recognition to women in public life in Australia. In fact, I put forward a proposal in 1984 that more House of Representatives seats in Australia be named after women of achievement&mdash;prominent Australian women. I did a lot of research&mdash;my staff helped&mdash;on that subject. It is always very easy to make a proposal about doing something; we not only made a proposal but also did the hard work and suggested who the seats might be named after. I am very proud to say that most of the names put forward by me were adopted by the Australian Electoral Commission. So many members of the House of Representatives today represent seats with names that I proposed which commemorate and mark the enormous achievement of women in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came here in the early 1980s, the six-year Senate turn prescribed under the Constitution was largely theoretical. With one exception, very few people had actually served a six-year term in this place. The only person at that time who served a full six-year term, which was the one laid down by the Constitution of Australia, was the former President of the Senate, Senator Douglas McClelland. He had the distinction in the late 1960s and early 1970s of having served a six-year term. The rest of us during the 1980s found that we were serving one and a half-year terms, three-year terms or whatever. It is something to note now that half of the 72 senators in this place who come from the States will have served a six-year term on 30 June. So that is quite a change from the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I refer to one of the ironies of politics as it has affected me. There are many ironies in politics, but one has affected me particularly. As a result of the 1987 double dissolution, I had the misfortune of being the last person to get a six-year term. Senator Robert Hill, who is on the other side of the chamber, was the one who missed out on getting that six-year term and was the first person to get a three-year term. Had events turned out otherwise, I would have been facing re-election in 1990, not 1993, and I will leave you to work out the implications of that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking over that particular time, I remember listening to a very impassioned speech by Senator Jim Short, who was the frontbencher in the Opposition who had carriage of electoral matters at the time. He made a very moving speech about how we should work out who would get a short term, a three-year term, and who would get a six-year term in this place. He made a very interesting speech saying that we should in fact use the proposal set down in section 282 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act; that is, that after a double dissolution one could look at the votes for the 12 elected persons and assume that it had been a half-Senate election, and the six who would have been elected in the half-Senate election would get the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of history now that we on the government side of this place decided to stick with the traditional method of working out who got the six-year terms and who got the three-year terms. I very consistently supported that position over the time, but that is one of the unresolved items of business perhaps facing this place in the future; that is, whether we will ever actually determine that we will use that section 282 to determine who gets a long term and who gets a short term or whether we will stick with the traditional method which is basically that senators get the six-year terms according to the order in which they are elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that has struck me about being in this place over the last decade is one of the limitations on debate and on ideas on this place; that is, the number of times&mdash;it must be thousands of times I could have counted up over this period&mdash;that honourable senators, in making a comparison in a speech or in framing a question, have been able to compare Australia only with the United Kingdom or the US. I think this is one of the big limitations that we have to face up to in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, of course, it was fashionable to make comparisons with New Zealand for certain reasons. Sometimes Canada got a guernsey in these international comparisons. But we really do have this very serious problem in Australia, which has been reflected time and time again in this place, that honourable senators on all sides of the chamber&mdash;those on the frontbench and the backbench&mdash;do not seem to be able to talk in any great depth about what has been happening in the non-English speaking countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do live in a very conservative country and I think that this limitation that is imposed by our inability to speak other languages&mdash;of course I am generalising; I am a bad offender too as I do not have the ability to speak other languages&mdash;is an enormous inhibitor to the flow of ideas in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few people can talk about economic reforms that are occurring in, say, the non-English speaking countries in Europe. Very few people know about these sorts of things,  such as some of the very imaginative things that are done in running economies, in dealing with employment and in a whole range of policies. Time and time again we hear what has been happening in the UK or the US, or sometimes in New Zealand. I think we really have to deal with this. It is an important issue that has to be looked at in terms of language education in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney asked for the big one. There was a classic which I think Senator Boswell got very close to referring to this afternoon. It was the one that had that tantalising title `Inside Queensland's faltering economy'. It was published in 1985. It was one that I did a lot of work on to examine whether Queensland really had the dynamic economy that the National Party was saying it had. It looked at the competence of the then Queensland Government to run the Queensland economy. That was a bit of a landmark. It seemed to get quoted everywhere in parliaments around Australia. I think I was a bit of a bete noire in Queensland for a while, but it certainly did put some of the problems of Queensland's economic situation on the map. It pointed to the lack of diversification in that economy and its narrow base. Of course, things have changed over the last five years or so with diversification into tourism and so on in a very big way, but that was one of the ones I particularly remember.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of those newsletters I particularly remember is the one published in November 1990. So it is now 2 1/2 years ago that I was able to publish my first research report on the implications of the goods and services tax in Australia. I looked at that in great detail. I believe that I did expose a number of the problems with that tax at that time and certainly helped expose the arguments in support of it over the next 2 1/2 years. I think it had some small impact in getting the ALP to think about what the implications of the GST were, were an election to be held some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the privilege of serving as a committee chair for six years. It has been a very interesting time. A number of people in the chamber have served with me and I have certainly valued their contributions to my committee work. I must say that I have been helped enormously by having an extremely high calibre secretariat. I would like to particularly thank the committee secretary, Ms Ilze Svenne, who has been a tower of strength to all of us on the committee on all sides of the chamber and has helped us turn out some extremely good reports, particularly in recent times. There was one on Australia's role in UN peacekeeping and one that I think was referred to by Senator Hill today on Latin America. I think we also had the same sort of support from our secretariat staff before her time and were able to turn out a landmark report on Australia's relationship with India which has led to a number of the recommendations being adopted by the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is basically what I propose to say tonight. I have enjoyed my time here. I have enjoyed the 10 years that I have had in the Australian Senate. It has been an enormous honour for me and an enormous opportunity. I have never sat in opposition in this place and that is, I suppose, something to be remembered. I do know what opposition is like. I served on the staff of an opposition leader prior to coming here.

That is why we are on this side and you are on that side. That does not necessarily make us a better party but it does mean, in terms of understanding the way the mechanics of politics work, that we are probably a little better at it than you.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look back on the time I came here in 1984 things were slightly different from now. The value of people leaving Parliament from time to time is the opportunity it gives for them to reflect a little on what we are doing here. Every day we go through the same routines; we are bogged down by the workloads that we seem to take on like Calvinist operators&mdash;the more work we have, the better we are and the happier we feel&mdash;and we do not have a chance to think about what we are actually doing. Occasions like this give us a chance&mdash;as Peter Walsh showed us tonight&mdash;to think about where we are going and what we are doing; and to ask is this particular institution evolving and, more particularly, is it relevant to what goes on out there in the big community?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that strikes me when I look at that particular period is how naive we were then compared with now. Nobody knew about economics then. They were the days before we all pretended that we were economists. If we fell over a Laffer curve, we would not have recognised it in a fit. In fact, we had just been introduced to the J-curve. We did not know what a comparable factor endowment was. To tell the truth&mdash;come on, be honest&mdash;very few of you know even now what any of those are. I think that the most exciting Senate committee hearing that we could have would be to call the Prime Minister in and ask him what was the J-curve; what was it intended to do; and what happened to it?  It has just disappeared into the ether. Nevertheless, I must say that all of you were very impressed at the time, even Senator Short, who had been in Treasury, and pretended to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that all of us have talked about economics. We have been dominated by the imperatives of economics in this House. My good friend Senator Maguire has talked about economics. He has made a very strong contribution in that area. There are people like Senator Walsh, who pursued economic logic and pushed fiscal probity as far as he could, and was recognised as being an important person in that particular area. Most of us in this place, let us face it, are not economists, yet, on the whole, we have been convinced that we ought to be economists and that we ought to talk the language of other people outside this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is simply that we are politicians. We do not like the term. `Politicians' has been a dirty word out there because it is associated with, say, American politicians of 1910, where you went into Parliament, got yourself half a railway, made a fortune and retired. That is not really what it is all about. The word `politician' comes from the Greek word `polis', which means people together living in a community and it means that you represent that community. The simple fact is that we do not represent the economists. We do not represent that small group who went off to Harvard, Sydney University or the ANU and learnt the language; we represent the community out there. </PARA>

We all could have taken sides and kicked the hell out of each other, but we worked towards what we thought were the only available options at that time. I know that, in many ways, that will have an effect but because we were not partisan the public servants, the bureaucrats, have gone back and looked at that report and said that there are some options there that we could use and the Minister will get that report and their response on his desk in a couple of months, and I think they will affect what the Government will do. </PARA>

I will give you a bit of a lecture here for five minutes on what I think you ought to do. I will be out of this place; I have had 15 years and it is time for me to go. But the one thing that I think this Parliament has to do is to ensure that the balance between the bureaucracy, the media and the Parliament is at least sustained&mdash;that one is not over the other. I must say that in the eight or nine years I have been here the one thing I have noted is that the bureaucracy is on top at the moment. In terms of balance, it has the greater power not because it is unseemly, devious or whatever but because we have created an environment in which we have put the weight on the scales of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to one of the most important changes that happened in this Parliament and that most of us missed&mdash;the ball went whizzing in a wide curve, straight through to the keeper and we missed it. They were the changes in 1987 when David Block was asked to report to the Government about the way government departments ought to be restructured. The super ministries were created in 1987, when we reduced the ministries from 28 to 19, when we said that all these major departments that clearly had a Minister who was responsible and who you could drag into this place or into the House of Representatives were to be amalgamated. Just exactly who was the Minister responsible for various sections was not quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the first step. It was a major change. It created super ministries. It gave power to the bureaucracy, which was something that had not been done before in quite an overt way. The funny thing about that was that when the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was asked a question about this he said that it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the most far-reaching reshaping of the Federal machinery of government and of public administration in our history.</PARA>
<PARA>He did not say at the time that no bureaucrat need live in poverty by 1992, but what he said, taking aside the hyperbole, is a very important point. That decision was made by the Prime Minister in an administrative fiat with no discussion in Cabinet&mdash;no Cabinet decision&mdash;and it went straight through this Parliament with very little being said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results are now starting to show. I am sure the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Bob Collins, has no objection to my saying that one of his biggest problems in a number of areas that he has had to deal with recently has been trying to work out who the hell did what. Was it his bureaucrats, the Minister under him, the Minister assisting him, the Minister in the House of Representatives or the other Minister in the Senate? The simple fact is: we, as a parliament, whether we blame Bob Collins or not, have a lot to take account of. The fact is we let that through. We let that major change in government structures through with very little comment here. In other words, we talked in estimates committee hearings about this and that, where the dollar went here and where the dollar went there, but we really let the biggest change in the history of public administration this century through to the keeper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that was the first thing I noticed, and that relates to one other thing that I want to finish on tonight&mdash;that is, the question of the isolation of this Parliament from the general community. If you are going to ask yourself one question as politicians, at the end of the day you have to ask yourself this: is this Parliament relevant to the community it serves? All of you know that the membership of political parties in this country has declined over the last decade&mdash;declined immeasurably. In the Labor Party in some cases in some States membership is literally a tenth of what it was 10 years ago. The Liberal Party membership has gone down. The Labor Party membership has gone down. Independents find it difficult to get people to work for them. Only the National Party has kept up its membership. I am not sure of the reason for that. Maybe it is because the members of the National Party are the only socialists left in the Parliament&mdash;you know, the agrarian socialists. Maybe it is because they make being a member of the National Party a social event. </PARA>

But the simple fact is that all of us have experienced the problem, with the exception of the National Party, of a declining membership around Australia. That means that the sorts of people we are picking to go into parliament and the sorts of people who are choosing the ones to go into parliament are based on a far narrower base than, say, 10 years ago. That, in itself, is a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once you get to Canberra, following the creation of the super ministries, you also have a new bureaucratic arrangement, which I think most of us are having great difficulty in understanding. For example, if you went out into the street and said, `What's DOPIE? What's DITAC? What's DOTAC? What's DFAT? What's DEET?'. The average intelligent person in the street would say, `What the hell are you talking about?'. Yet these are the departments that affect people's lives right round this country. These are the super departments that have been created that affect business, little battlers, ordinary people, everyone in the Australian community, yet the Australian community would be almost unaware of the existence of these super departments and of the way they operate. Even for skilled lobbyists, the difficulty is to get into this place to find out how it works and how you affect the decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the biggest question that this Parliament has to ask itself, and every individual member of the Parliament has to ask himself or herself, is: are we relevant and are we accessible to the community? Do they understand the processes that we follow here? I do not care whether they understand when the Black Rod moves in and puts the mace there when the Senate is not sitting or sitting or when the President comes in at a certain time. That is basically irrelevant. What is more relevant is whether people know how to get to us and how to influence the process and whether they understand the process. If we start talking like economists or bureaucrats, we are in trouble, because at the end of the day we are politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is our role. It is not something that is demeaning. Let the press tell you that if they like, but being a politician means being a person of the people. That does not mean shaking hands with some bewildered pensioner in front of a camera during an election campaign where someone says, `Do you want to meet Bob Hawke?' and suddenly there is a golden handshake and the poor old pensioner has had his hand grasped and the camera is on him and suddenly Bob Hawke has gone off with an entourage of 20 people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe Senator Watson would. I must say that Senator Watson has been one of the most valuable members of this Senate since I have been here. I intended to mention Senator Watson later because he has spent time on our education committee where he was a very great contributor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of things I have noticed is that when someone like Senator Watson does his homework, goes through all the issues, objectively looks at what affects people in the community&mdash;whether they are accountants or people who are paying taxes&mdash;and comes back to this Parliament with views about how the legislation should be changed, he gets listened to. I must say that I have never seen anyone affect government legislation individually more than Senator Watson has because the suggestions and the amendments he has made get taken on trust. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Someone like Minister McMullan listens to what he has to say, the advisers listen to what he has to say and on the whole they trust him. They do not find that in two weeks' time he has dudded them because he has given them smart advice which was intended to give his party an advantage. They take his views on trust. Over and over again in this Parliament I have many people perplexed by the complexity of the sort of situations that they are faced with, particularly in relation to tax legislation, and Senator Watson has been able to help us through the situation. That has been a very valuable contribution and I pay tribute to him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to my staff&mdash;Charles, Carol, Scott and Jane. I particularly pay tribute to Scott Davies who ran an incredibly good campaign in Bass. He helped win the seat of Bass from a person who was a very good shadow Minister, one of the best shadow Ministers the Liberal Party had. I have to pay tribute to my staff for that, but I am sorry in a way that a good member like Warwick Smith lost his seat. However, that is politics and that is the way it goes. We would not be in government if some good members on the other side had not lost their seats or had failed to get seats that they should have won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the committee itself, I would like to thank John Tierney, Paul Calvert, Karin Sowada, Winston Crane, Olive Zakharov and previous members John Watson, Kay Patterson and Robert Bell for the contributions they made. It was very important to me and this Parliament that they were able to work with me and the secretary, Brenton Holmes, and members of the secretariat. What we did was very important in many ways. For example, a couple of the reports we have produced are already set on the university curriculum. Some of them are in their fourth reprint and many of them are used as vade mecums for the bureaucracy. People look at what we have done and they say, `Let's have a talk about this with the Minister'. They actually use it to go through particular issues. They use it as advice. I think that is another aspect of the Senate that has in many cases been overlooked. </PARA>

But at the end of the day you need a few Bolsheviks around the place. You need people like Peter Walsh who says, `The Prime Minister is an old jellyback because he has reneged on his promises'. You need people like Michael Baume who says, `Come on John it is not good enough. You forgot the arts'&mdash;and the Liberals did.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, it is a pleasure to see you in the chair at this late hour. I was actually inclined to think that it really was not necessary for me to make a speech as I leave the Senate because one of the features of my time in this place has been the extent to which various aspects of my life, both personal and political, have been made an open book. I thought I could go home early. It probably will not surprise anybody when I say that not all the chapters have actually been written. I do not know whether I will follow in the footsteps of other former politicians in writing a book, especially other former Democrat leaders such as Chipp, Haines and Macklin, who have all produced their books. I do not know whether John has started his yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I did write a book it might reveal certain so far unpublished facts. There certainly would be at least one chapter devoted to the inevitability of Cheryl Kernot's rise to the Democrat leadership. It would begin with the crucial initiation in her home State of Queensland of the petition to oust me from this position in the early months of 1991. It will be no doubt of interest to senators who are staying in this place&mdash;and looking at list of those who are speaking tonight it seems that there are hardly any of you staying&mdash;that the incoming Democrat Senator elect for Queensland, the Reverend John Woodley, officiated over that exercise as State President at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a party worker, and later as a senior party official, in the nine years before I came here for the Australian Democrats I was close to the operations of the Democrat Senate party room. I was even closer after I came here. It was always clear to me that operating the stressful and highly responsible role of balancing power within a small group of people&mdash;all with fair sized egos that we must have to come here as politicians in the first place&mdash;and working in a hot house atmosphere would be a very difficult task. This was only able to be successful because of the existence of trust and mutual support. The replacement of that approach with politics of Machiavelli, McCarthy and even a touch of Bob Roberts, who has not made it to Canberra yet, have seen me, others and tens of thousands of voters leave the Democrats. I leave the Senate as an Independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fascinated by Senator Maguire's analysis of the differences that might have occurred had different decisions been made in this place after the 1987 election. While he was speaking I worked out that had a different decision been made, I would not have been up for re-election in 1993. In fact, I would have been re-elected in 1990 and Senator Spindler would not even be here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the opportunity that this speech gives me to say how much I have enjoyed, over the last 10 months, working with Senator Chamarette of the Western Australian Greens. I have seen in that period the continuation of the work that I have always done in this place and before I came here. The firm, principled policy position of the Greens and other groups, with whom I worked in the recent election campaign, reflects very much the deeply held convictions and priorities that landed me here in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that Senator Chamarette is a politician whose style I admire and whose influence on the work of the Senate and the Parliament is, and I am sure will continue to be, a very positive one. I wish her and her new colleague Senator Margetts well in the challenge that lies ahead for them. I am comforted and encouraged by the knowledge that they will be here carrying on the work which I would have wanted to do had the election result been rather different for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a few more remarks about political style. It really worries me that the nature of politics, as it is practised by the most prominent politicians, although not necessarily the majority of politicians, is such that the average Australian is turned off, repulsed, even scornful of politics, politicians, and most disturbingly of the political and parliamentary process upon which our democracy depends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been my goal, throughout my political life, and particularly during my time in this place, to make a positive contribution to breaking down that stereotype. It has been really important to me that the game should not be played for its own sake, that I should not be seduced by the trappings of office or the exercise of power and influence, that I stay in touch with real life and real people and their real feelings and challenges, and that I truly serve those in need particularly those in need of a political voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of that public perception&mdash;and I think it is a view that is distorted, because the public only gets part of the picture via the media&mdash;there are a great many politicians who actually spend the vast bulk of their time in this place working outside that stereotype. They are the people whom I admire and respect in politics. I like to call them `the quiet achievers'. Some are not always all that quiet all the time, of course, but their achievements are considerable. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those achievements and some of those people have already been mentioned. They are not the people you see featuring nightly on the network news or on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> or on the big-time talkback radio. They are not there slanging at the other side during Question Time or in the heated debates of little consequence. They are the ones who are there doing the hard slog of the heavily responsible work in committees, both party committees and parliamentary committees. They sometimes make the most worthwhile and best researched speeches in matters of public importance and urgency motions. Here I think of Graham Maguire, of John Coates and others. They go on in this fashion year after year, serving their party and the Parliament and the public well, with loyalty and with substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the ones who often band together to shift the party heavies&mdash;and sometimes that is literally the party heavies&mdash;from an unacceptable policy position. They are the ones who rescue the committee system&mdash;and they do it regularly&mdash;from partisanship. They enhance the political process, the Parliament and the democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly value my time on committees in this place because, as I have said, that is where you see so many of these people. It has been a particular pleasure to serve on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee&mdash;some critical comments were made about the Scrutiny of Bills Committee a minute ago; I did not agree with those&mdash;on the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the transport and whatever else it was committee, which has now been merged, and, right up until noon today, on the Privileges Committee. It is there that I have met these quiet achievers and worked with them&mdash;the Pat Gileses, the Barney Cooneys, the Bruce Childses, the John Coateses, and the Peter Duracks&mdash;quieter these years than in earlier years. I have not worked on committees with John Watson or with Margaret Reid, but those are the sorts of people, as I said, that I respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that nobody on the front bench of either party has those sorts of qualities&mdash;of course they do&mdash;but I think it is true to say that, where those qualities do exist, they are not given emphasis or they are ignored or they are even discouraged, particularly by the media. I always remember how John Hewson vowed, when he took the leadership of the Liberal Party in May 1990, that he would not get down into the gutter, that he would raise the tone of the House of Representatives. Within two weeks he clearly had been discharged; certainly you could see it in the media. I can imagine his advisers telling him that this was no good; he had to mix it with Bob Hawke. I felt that was a shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that people on the front bench and those on the cross benches who bear the heavy responsibilities that they do should never lose sight of this further and crucial area of responsibility. They are the face of politics. They ultimately decide whether it is an ugly face, a face that causes people outside here to turn away, or whether it is a strong, responsible and trustworthy face, a face that draws more good people towards it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This speech marks the end of seven years of parliamentary work, and of course I have some regrets about the end of this particular stage of my life. But overwhelmingly when I look back I feel a great satisfaction and some pride in what I have been able to use this platform to achieve during those years. I would like to mention just a few highlights. They are in some kind of chronological order to the extent that I can get it right. I think I had been here two weeks when the new disability services legislation came before the Senate. I was able to succeed in amending that legislation with the Opposition to include the psychiatrically disabled, who had been excluded from the new disability administration that was being put in place. There were a lot of other successful amendments that I have been involved in, but this does remain the highlight for me, perhaps because it was a significant first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing I would like to mention is the establishment, at my instigation, of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals and their alternatives. I would acknowledge, in particular, the patience of the then Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, who stood by his commitment to give Government support for the committee's establishment, even in the face of almost a year of bitter resistance and hours and hours of debate in the Senate. It is worth noting, I think, that now in 1993 we have moved a long way on the question of organic agriculture to the extent of official government clean green policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I would mention my own role in opposing the Gulf War, a position which I believe has been strongly vindicated since. In particular, I was pleased to provide the catalyst for the recall of both houses of parliament in January 1991 to debate the Australian involvement in that war. I hope that this might have set a precedent and that no future government will consider sending troops overseas without such a debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly proud of having been able to break a 13-year log-jam, following the Fraser Government's legislation in 1976, banning electronic advertising of tobacco products. Senator Evans has already mentioned my successful private member's Bill passed in 1989 implementing a print ban on tobacco products. This has been followed up only three years later. If I did not have an abhorrence of mixed metaphors I would say that the log-jam was broken and the snowball rolled down the hill, but I am not sure that that would work. However, it has only taken three years for the rest of the promotion and advertising of tobacco products to be cut off by a government which was spurred into action by that breakthrough which was made possible by the years of persistent work against the odds, and against a tremendous lobby, by a wide range of community and health organisations who followed up in this more receptive political climate and finally achieved their goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to acknowledge, too, the role of people in both parties who urged their leadership to support the first measure in 1989 and who then made that political climate there for last year's legislation, particularly Peter Baume, Peter Staples and others. I think the three of us have been found to be too left for all of our respective parties, when you think about it. The whole community benefits from these moves, particularly generations of young people still to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent achievement, if you like, to which my name is not attached in any way but which is an excellent example of the work of quiet achievers, is the removal of the ban on homosexuals serving in the ADF. This ban was opposed by many enlightened people within the Government party. I was really pleased to have the opportunity to use tactics on the floor of this chamber to strengthen their position against an unacceptable policy position. They used that increased muscle to establish their committee and eventually won the day. That was a great step forward in human rights in this country and a very important move in the individual human lives of many women and men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all of the people who have made our time in this place bearable, possible and even enjoyable. I share Senator Giles's experience of suddenly feeling that life was easy when I got here, that people did things for you. Since I had come out of the kitchen sink into the Senate, I suppose it was very easy to feel that way. I thank all of those people around this place who have done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Senator Giles is the only other senator&mdash;and, Pat, we really do think along parallel lines&mdash;to have mentioned the improvement brought about by the move from the old Parliament House. The improvement in working conditions for our parliamentary staff alone would have made it worth while.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> staff, who are always able to turn us into lucid human beings, and the PLOs. When Senator Chamarette leaves, she will have some good PLO stories. I will not tell them, Christabel; I will leave them for you. I thank the committee secretariats. It is all very well to say that it is good to work on committees with people across party lines, but the people who work in the committee secretariats are indispensable to that process. I particularly mention the Parliamentary Education Office. This marvellous and very valuable institution is growing, and I wish it well in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I thank the President and the Deputy President. The President will remember that I, along with all other senators who fill a casual vacancy, had my own private briefing. He told me all the right things to do. When I first came in here I did all the wrong things&mdash;I asked a long question and I gave a long notice of motion&mdash;and he sat there and took it. I thank him for the early call yesterday for my last question in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to include in my thanks many of the people in the press gallery, not only for the job that they do, and do well, but also&mdash;and this is a personal thanks, as it is to many of the other staff and workers around this place&mdash;for the great measure of personal support that I have felt from them at some particularly difficult times for me in this place and again now that I am leaving. </PARA>

This week I have been joined by all of my staff. It has been a wonderful experience to have not only the professional support and the professional expertise but also the personal loyalty and the love of a group of people who are my best friends. It should never be forgotten that while we all cheer each other up as we go off into the wild blue yonder, and people ask us what we are going to do, those people are out of a job as well.

I assure the Senate that I feel absolutely no need for psychological help in making the transition to the next stage of my life. I hope it will be a productive new decade for me. I am sure that I will find new ways to be a nuisance to both Government and Opposition and, most importantly, to continue to be an activist on behalf of issues and people in the community which have always meant such a lot to me and which got me into politics and parliament in the first place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been a bumpy night for a lot of us. I am in the position of following 10 other speakers. I feel very humbled because those speakers have spoken very eruditely about their time here. They have all had many years of very distinguished service. I leave the Senate having served only 22 months, and I am very conscious of those who have contributed much more over many more years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one had asked me before the election what I was going to say in my valedictory speech, I would have laughed because, like Senator Powell, and I guess many members in the House of Representatives, I had expected to be elected. I had every expectation of spending another six years here pursuing the issues and causes dear to my heart. But such are the vicissitudes of politics. In the words of another senator, `The people have spoken'&mdash;much to my disappointment. But I must accept that result without bitterness and rancour, while examining the post-30 June scenario as a new phase in my life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall miss the Senate&mdash;there is no question about that. Contributing to the national debate on important issues such as youth unemployment, education, training and science has truly been a rare honour. To serve the people of New South Wales has been a privilege, and for that I thank God. It is possible to help people in a very real way here, either corporately or individually, and that has been a tremendous revelation. Being part of the balance of power has been challenging intellectually and a real test of political skill&mdash;a test that I have relished and thrived on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall miss the cut and thrust of this chamber and the enjoyment of watching personalities play out their differences on the national stage. There are, as you would be aware, some firm friends and arch foes across party lines&mdash;although I think sometimes those animosities are more imagined than real. For example, Senator Walters versus Senator Collins. They have had some notable clashes certainly in the 18 months that I have been here. Senator Spindler and Senator Kemp&mdash;that goes without saying. We have all watched the exchanges between those two senators over a range of issues and I have certainly found their conversations in this chamber most entertaining. Of course, Senator Bishop and Senator Evans&mdash;and maybe quite a lot of other people as well&mdash;have likewise been very entertaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On first entering the Senate it did not take me long to realise that politicians were one of the most vilified groups in the community&mdash;and with good reason. Who in their right mind would work from 10 a.m. until 2 a.m. the next morning, a whole day in one go, without any overtime payment? Who would put up with phone calls from journalists, party members and assorted hacks at almost any hour of the day? We do. And what worker would willingly and ritually depart one's home for a whole week, 22 weeks of the year, leaving behind spouse and children only to be abused in this place and eat substandard food in the canteen downstairs? I tell you what, it defies all logic. We must be absolutely mad, and what is more, we enjoy it. That is the great paradox of this situation. It is no wonder the public shake their collective head in wonder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the lasting impressions I will have of this place will come as a surprise to most members of the public. The adversarial nature of Question Time means that we give the public an impression of really hating each other's guts. But I was pleasantly surprised when I first came here to find that it is possible to form friendships across party lines and how important this element of the Senate is in the way this place runs. I have to say, I have really enjoyed getting to know people from a whole range of parties&mdash;and they know who they are&mdash;through committees, through the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship and through other social occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also say that I have learnt a great deal by watching the style of senators in this place: the way that people use the procedures to achieve their goals, the way people speak, the way they manage to interject at the right time&mdash;and I guess, Senator Walters, you will go down in history in some respects as the doyen of interjecting. I have to say that I have learned a great deal from your tenacity and your capacity to get up and speak on virtually any subject at any time when called on. I think that is something for which you will be fondly remembered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also leave this place in the knowledge that my time here was very short but, although my time here was short, I managed, I think, to put some runs on the board in relation to a few issues. I think I would regard the youth unemployment inquiry of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training as perhaps my most important work. For perhaps the first time the young people of Australia&mdash;and not just a select group invited by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;actually had an opportunity to put their views on the record about the challenges facing young Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanted: Our Future</EMPHASIS>, the committee report, is a very important document, and I shall be sorry not to have the opportunity to debate the Government's response to that committee report in the Budget sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the intrigues of pay television, the foolishness of the tax cuts and the time wasted over procedural motions in this place, we must not lose sight of the many thousands of Australians facing long term unemployment; many of them are young Australians. These people are looking to us, the Parliament and its decision-makers, to put aside self-interested political points-scoring and devise real solutions to this most pressing of social problems. For we must recognise the trauma created by unemployment: the family breakdown; the hardship and the emotional stress of financial difficulty; the loss of self-esteem, particularly for men, and the social problems arising from it. While unemployment rises, State and Federal governments will continue to plug the dyke with bandaid measures to help people pick up the fragments of their shattered lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found the Senate committees to be one of the most rewarding aspects of parliamentary work. Working on the Senate employment committee has been one of the most encouraging and positive experiences of my time here, and I guess that is reflected in many of the comments made by other senators. Each member of that committee brought to the work a sense of dedication and enthusiasm which enhanced the quality of each report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to the chairman of that committee, Terry Aulich. I have never worked with a chairman inside or outside of politics who has such a capacity to forge consensus between opposing views. His understanding of the issues, combined with a sensitivity for the politics of compromise, meant that even the most controversial matters were handled amicably and with good humour by the committee. Mr Deputy President, I would hope that this could be the norm for all committees in future. I wish Senator Aulich all the very best for his future, and I thank other committee members for their friendship and hard work, in addition, of course, to the secretariat led by Brenton Holmes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly I will remember with great fondness many of the public hearings that we had and the working relationships with people like Winston Crane and John Tierney, whose knowledge and understanding of education issues never ceased to amaze me; Olive Zakharov and Paul Calvert, of course, whose sense of humour was always a source of great amusement to me; and many others on that committee who contributed so much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a truism almost that hardly a major decision is made in this place without some input from a parliamentary committee of some description. This Senate has enormous powers and nowhere is this more evident than in the committee system it has established for itself. I would hope that as time passes senators here would perhaps push the envelope of parliamentary reform a little further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the avalanche of delegated legislation by way of regulation is an issue that I believe requires urgent attention. The widening of regulatory powers in Bills has proliferated as the bureaucracy has sought to avoid scrutiny and exercised much more control over public policy. I think here I would echo the comments of Senator Aulich in relation to the bureaucracy, and it is time that we pulled them back and held them to account and made them much more accountable for what they bring into this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of various disallowance motions that I have moved, it has become plainly obvious that the Senate needs to examine ways of more effectively dealing with regulations. The disallowance mechanism is a heavy handed and crude method of dealing with delegated legislation. The purposes of review and scrutiny would be better served by creating a procedure to amend regulations in the same way that we deal with Bills. I understand that Senator Harradine is developing a private member's Bill to address this very issue, and I hope that my colleagues and colleagues in the Opposition will give this Bill their due consideration because this is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have asked me what I plan to do after 30 June, and the answer is very easy because, rather than watching Government Ministers dig holes for themselves, I shall return to the desert sands of Egypt and the great tells of Jordan to dig holes of my own. For, quite literally, on 1 July my research will suddenly reappear and I shall resume my former life as an archaeologist as suddenly as I became a senator. Yes, friends, I will once again have the pleasure of experiencing education at the coal face of the Dawkins reforms&mdash;the inadequate library and research facilities, the shrinking funding for the humanities and the academic politics which accompany a large university. Those of you who have come from an institution will know that academics play it as hard and as fast as we do here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A great training ground for politics. I have a sneaking suspicion I might get drafted to the university Senate at some stage. The hardship of leaving this place is balanced by the privilege of returning to study the ancient past. The hot desert sands of Egypt still hold many treasures, as we have seen from recent reports in the newspapers. Despite the excitement of this place, nothing can quite match the thrill of discovery and the challenging task of piecing together the history of a long forgotten culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own research will examine the pottery of ancient Egypt from the late pre-dynastic to the end of the third dynasty in an attempt to more clearly define the chronological relationships of this period. In addition, I hope to answer something more of the foreign relations between Egypt and its neighbours in the late fourth and early third millennium. I will be Senator Calvert's worst nightmare: an academic completing research on a topic incomprehensible to his waste watch committee. I will look forward to Senator Calvert's contributions on the Australian Research Council annual report in the Budget session, as I have watched with interest over the last 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the pleasures about leaving the Senate is that I will rediscover my marriage. Shirley, I have to tell you that I could not boil an egg when I came here and I still cannot. So, now that I am leaving, perhaps I will finally learn how to do that. I am sure my husband is waiting at home, just waiting to teach me how to cook; for the first time in 31 years, I might actually learn something. Many of you would know that I had been married for only some six weeks before being thrust headlong into this place, so the opportunity to spend meaningful time with my husband, Armon Hicks, is something I look forward to with great enthusiasm. Indeed, I would like to place on the record my thanks for his unrelenting support over the last 22 months as we worked through the trials and tribulations of parliamentary life. I really do not know what I would have done without him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are others to thank. My parents were always ready with dinner after a week in Canberra whenever we were too tired, frazzled or too sick to cook for ourselves&mdash;or for Armon to cook for ourselves. Our friends patiently kept in touch with us during long absences in Canberra. Officials of the Parliament, the Black Rod's office, Bruce and Kearen in the transport office, the committee secretariats, the catering staff, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the Senate attendants and the drivers were all always obliging and helpful. I would like to add my support to the Comcar drivers here as I, like many other women in this place, greatly value the security that we feel when we are travelling home at 4 o'clock in the morning. I really do think that any proposal to abolish Comcar would be strenuously opposed, not only by Comcar drivers but by every woman senator and member in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Special mention must be made of those people without whom a Democrat senator could not survive&mdash;Harry Evans, Anne Lynch and Cleaver Elliott. My special thanks to them for all the help, assistance and advice they have offered me in the past 22 months. Their kind attention when I first arrived in this place made the transition to political life much more comprehensible and much less terrifying. Of course, there are the Democrats' staff and members without whom I could have achieved nothing. Fundamentally, I thank my party for giving me the opportunity to serve my country in this very special way. My staff&mdash;Pam, Jaqui, Aldis, Jeff and Natasha&mdash;kept the ship afloat and helped to ensure that, in a short time, we achieved a great deal. To them I owe a deep debt of gratitude, along with my State and Federal parliamentary colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next three years will not be easy for the Democrats but I am sure that, under the leadership of Senator Kernot, the party will restore its electoral fortunes and continue as a vital force in Australian political life. To those other senators leaving, you have my warmest regards and my best wishes for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there we have it, colleagues. My time here has been brief, and perhaps I will return. But my father always told me that it was better to live short and live like a lion than live long and live like a sheep. Whilst I do not agree with that sentiment as applied to life as a whole, it does sum up my time here as a senator. I have absolutely no regrets. I thank you all and I wish you well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, and we know why. That was when my State Liberal member was suggesting to me that I think about some sort of career in politics. After being defeated at the State level, Senator Durack entered this chamber in 1971, after being elected in 1970. This gives him the honour of being father of the Senate, soon to be taken over by Senator Brian Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to refer to such a career in a few short words. He has held four portfolios, including the senior position of Attorney-General for almost six years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that. I am really indebted to my staff member Chris Fry for his assistance with the remarks I am to make about Senator Peter Walsh. Peter Walsh played, and continues to play, politics very hard. Indeed, on some occasions he obviously played it far too hard. After the events of late 1975, he maintained the rage more than most and for longer than most. As the leader of the party which has suffered more than its share of Walsh bile over the years, I can honestly say that, while on many occasions I disagreed with him, often vehemently, I also acknowledge that there was often substance behind the head kicking&mdash;well, I might acknowledge it in the case of head kicking the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like it or not, politics often involves opportunism and, unfortunately, stunts often generate headlines more easily than matters of substance. Also, the pursuit of power tends to become dominant over principle. None of these things could ever be laid at the feet of Peter Walsh. Few people in this place willingly sacrifice ministries. Fewer people still sacrifice senior Cabinet posts. Peter Walsh did so&mdash;apparently, with a deal of satisfaction. This gives us an insight into Peter's enigmatic nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He started in the Left and later helped found the grouping that became the Centre Left. But, ironically, he has been labelled as a member of the extreme Right because of his relishing the task of cutting public spending. I have differing views from many of those held by Peter in this area, but we have to acknowledge that he is driven by the principle of equity. He has no shortage of courage in pursuing what he regards as equitable, even if it involves criticising his own party. The income tax debate of recent times is a prime case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not really like the crusade he has engaged in in his pursuit of organised crime in this country. To use his words, he has personally, he believes, exposed the hairy-legged mafia, the ethnic mafia and the green mafia, not to mention some groupings of his own New South Wales colleagues. One would have thought that he might have championed a larger budget for the National Crime Authority. However, I am advised he did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I think he has been particularly unfair and savage against some high profile women, he and his wife, Rose, have raised a family of four daughters. Anyone involved in an achievement such as raising and debating adult daughters cannot be all bad and cannot have learnt nothing from the experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from his ministerial reputation, Peter Walsh also has an unmatched social reputation in this Parliament. He is a gregarious, generous host who avoids any semblance of pomposity or unnecessary formality. Party lines are irrelevant and all hatchets are buried as long as one can stand watching endless repeats of the West Coast Eagles. Indeed, his generosity has left more than one member of my staff, to my annoyance, with tired eyes and a sore head the next day. He has retained his larrikinism to this day. In short, Peter is an iconoclast in the Australian bush tradition and this Parliament is losing one of the sharpest thinkers it possesses. The faint praise I have personally received from him&mdash;that I am not bad for a Democrat&mdash;could well be the ultimate accolade. </PARA>

She has given long service to the areas of social welfare and community services in the Senate committees. She has an incredible record of working for women, and many others have pointed to this this evening. Time does not even allow me to scratch the surface. She has led Australian delegations to international conferences for women and she has an incredible range of friends and acquaintances from all around the world. I understand that in one respect she is quite a high flier in that she is a long term friend of the first woman in space, Valentina Tereshkova, who was also a member of the former USSR's Supreme Soviet.

We also acknowledge Janet's great achievement in becoming the first woman member of either House of this Parliament to have a private member's Bill passed by both chambers and written into law.

Karin had only been married six weeks, as she said, and what a way to start a marriage! It is absolutely no honeymoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Flo does know. But we do know that Karin and her husband are still married and that they will be grateful for the time that they will now have to spend together. Karin has done some excellent work for the Democrats while in this chamber. I cannot tell you what a relief it was to have somebody fill a casual vacancy who was not only competent and intelligent but with the bonus of being young and female as well. You all know that under casual vacancies anything is possible. Karin will not mind me saying that she hates the late nights, and from one so young! Karin will enjoy many sleep-ins from now on and we will all be incredibly envious. But as the doors close and open for Karin, in many respects we know that she has the world at her feet&mdash;in fact, so much of the fabric of past worlds beneath her feet and beneath her trowel. We know that she will return when she chooses to.</PARA></TALK.START>

Except for his reputation with Comcar drivers, Senator Michael Tate deserves to be treated by this Senate and his party with the dignity and honour which he has accorded to this chamber. I have enjoyed his logic and passion. I hope that he does not end up in the High Court, although Australia might be the better for that. </PARA>

It is worth noting what that response says. It is the three-paragraph letter which has been presented to the Senate tonight as the Government's response to the report. The letter says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Andrew</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Joint Standing Committee's report of August 1992 "Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian System: Achieving a Balance between Refuge and Control". As you know, the deadline for the Government's response to the report expired on 14 December 1992.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GERRY HAND</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is dated 5 February 1993. In other words, this so-called interim response to the joint standing committee's report is no response at all. It is simply a letter signed by the then Minister saying that he had not got a response, that he hoped to get a response through Cabinet and that he would present that response in the autumn session of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he wrote that letter in February this year, the response was already two months late. The deadline for the response was 14 December 1992. We have now come to the end of the autumn sittings still with no response to the committee's report. The deadline has now, therefore, been exceeded by something like six months. As I assume we will not be able to get a response until the Budget sittings, we are talking about a situation where the Government has had a delay of not far short of 12 months in presenting a response to the Senate on one of a Senate committee's more important reports of recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the best the new Minister, Senator Bolkus, can produce at this stage of his new ministerial career, then I am afraid it sends some very dangerous signals about his ability to address the urgent problems of Australia's handling of refugee and humanitarian migration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report certainly does raise and deal with complex issues and it certainly does require a careful response by the Government, but to delay a response by the amount of time that this one has been delayed I believe is disgraceful and inexcusable. That joint standing committee report is important, because as it states in its foreword:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a refugee crisis of proportions not seen since the Second World War has been developing on a global scale. Australia, like many other countries around the world, has been faced with an increasing number of asylum seekers applying for refugee status either once they have entered the country or upon arrival at the border. The dramatic growth in on-shore asylum seekers is a major international problem, which is likely to become considerably worse.</PARA>
<PARA>The report provides principles and policies which need to be adopted within our onshore refugee and humanitarian system. The refugee problem, as we all know, is immense. As is pointed out on page 39 of this report, general refugee claimants have increased tenfold over the last three years alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to Australian taxpayers is escalating. The cost of maintaining the boat people in detention centres alone is now more than $21 million. The cost of providing legal assistance to these asylum seekers has been almost $1 1/2 million in the last two years alone&mdash;and that excludes the costs involved in litigation. The boat people currently on our shores comprise only one aspect of Australia's total refugee and humanitarian intake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The massive increase in onshore refugee applicants has come about largely because of then Prime Minister Hawke's statement that no Chinese student in Australia at the time of the Tiananmen Square incident should be forced to return home. Plus, the numbers of onshore refugee applicants have been swollen by the arrival on our shores of nearly 700 boat people from the PRC and Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Processing the applications from the many thousands of Chinese students applying for refugee status, from both those who were here at the time of the Tiananmen Square tragedy and those who have arrived since, has created a massive problem for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. We urgently need a response from the Government on how it proposes to handle the 17,000 pre-Tiananmen Square tragedy Chinese students in Australia and their 9,000 dependents. Those 26,000 people have a four-year so-called special category of temporary resident permit granted by then Prime Minister Hawke which expires on 30 June next year, just 12 months hence. The Government has to date done no pre-processing of these people in advance of that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the problem of the detaining by the Australian Government of Chinese and Cambodian boat people in detention centres on our shores. Some of the detainees have been here for more than three years without resolution of their cases. The Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, has expressed a number of major concerns about Australia's human rights obligations under domestic and international law in respect of those detainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Senate has today referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations a reference in relation to this whole question of detention of persons who enter Australia without valid entry permits. It is a very important subject indeed. It is one which this joint committee report, to which the Government has refused to give a response, deals with and it heightens the significance of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are urgent and pressing matters. I am amazed and disgusted that the Government has taken so long and still failed to produce any response at all to the committee's report. It is a matter of considerable urgency. I would urge Senator Bolkus to get a government response to this report as soon as possible. Whether it is possible to do that and to have it available to honourable senators during the recess I do not know. I would have thought it should, but I do stress to you, Mr Deputy President, and to the Senate the seriousness of the subject, the urgency of the matter with which we are dealing and the urgency of the need to get a response. I hope that that will be conveyed to the Minister as a matter of top priority. </PARA>

On 12 March 1993 I was not terribly interested in reading letters from the Minister&mdash;I probably received this the day after the election. Nevertheless, it goes to a crucial issue which I had been raising with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to forcibly repatriating detainees who are refugee asylum seekers to the PRC, a key element of consideration is what will happen to them on their return. All honourable senators here surely would recognise that as a most important consideration. In this letter the Minister indicated that the secretary to the department had received from Chinese officials a guarantee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that after they come back they will not be persecuted and not mistreated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement by the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister, Liu Huaqiu, on 6 December 1992. The previous paragraph refers to the assurances provided by the PRC officials in both Australia and China:</PARA>

<PARA>That is what it boils down to. But that is beside the point. The issue is whether they will be punished for their pro-democracy activities prior to their leaving China. As those of us who are deeply involved in this matter know, a number of very serious claims have been made that many of the people who have been forcibly repatriated by the Government are indeed undergoing extreme punishment. I know of one particular example of torture which is very grave. This is a very grave matter.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Harradine</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently you expressed concern about what would happen to Chinese boat people returned to the PRC after being refused authority to remain in Australia as refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware the government had received assurances from officials at the PRC Embassy in Canberra and from the PRC authorities through the Australian Embassy in Beijing. Essentially those assurances (which were provided orally by Chinese Government officials in both Australia and China) were that failed asylum seekers who are returned to China would not be punished as a result of their illegal departure from China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those assurances have been subsequently reaffirmed including when the Secretary of the Department of Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Conybeare, visited Beijing last December. The Chinese Vice Foreign Minister, Liu Huaqiu, on 6 December 1992 gave an assurance to Mr Conybeare in relation to both illegal immigrants and returning students, in these terms, "I can guarantee that after they come back they will not be persecuted and not mistreated".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently on 23 December 1992 the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen told the Australian Ambassador in Beijing that there was no persecution of returnees if their only action had been illegal departure from China, the Government's concerns lay with those who organised and profited from the illegal departures. He went on to say that the financial loss already suffered by the returnees was more than sufficient punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our Embassy's assessment that these assurances are intended to stand as official statements to the Australian Government of the Chinese Government's policy towards returnees, and that these statements can be relied on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An official in the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently provided advice on the group of seven PRC nationals who were returned to China on 23 October 1992. The official confirmed that these people were returned to their families after six days of detention. While in detention they had been questioned about the circumstances of their departure from China, the objective being to learn more about the organisation that had arranged the departures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This short period of detention was not inconsistent with our expectations of what might happen, and with Chinese government statements that illegal emigrants will not be mistreated on return to China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that the above will help to address the concerns that you, or anyone who approached you on this issue, may have had. Thank you for your interest in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Foreign Affairs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">The Senate, 27 May 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to table the Government's response to the Report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, "Australia's Efforts to Promote and Protect Human Rights".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights Sub-Committee of the JCFADT tabled its Report on 8 December 1992. The Report was the first from the JCFADT dealing with human rights. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Committee and members of the Human Rights Sub-Committee, particularly the then Chairman, Senator Chris Schacht, on the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report was comprehensive in scope and made a series of recommendations relating to the Australian Government's human rights policy. The Report stated that the Government's record was "laudable" and that most witnesses and most submissions approved of and appreciated the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One specific area in which the report criticises my portfolio's handling of human rights policy is in relation to Indonesia and East Timor. The Report stated that the 12 November Dili massacre and its outcome "deserved much stronger condemnation" from the Australian Government. The Report also stated that it was important that the Australian Government should be consistent in its reaction to human rights outrages of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I stated at the time, I do not believe that the Australian Government took a softer line on the Dili massacre than was warranted. This Government has a strong record of unswerving commitment to human rights. We have also adopted as far as possible the same approach to all cases of alleged human rights abuse wherever they may occur. In the case of East Timor, I said in this same place as recently as Monday, and I repeat it now: my hope and the Australian Government's hope has consistently been that Indonesian authorities will be able to achieve long term reconciliation in East Timor, through such strategies as a major reduction in the military presence, a major economic development strategy, further recognition of East Timor's distinctive cultural identity and possibly some greater degree of autonomy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCFADT's recommendations covered a range of other country's situations. The Report deals with Australian policy towards Bougainville, Sri Lanka, Burma, Vietnam, the Philippines, China, Tibet, Syrian Jews, Sudan, Guatemala and Salman Rushdie. Most of these recommendations do not run greatly counter to existing policy and the Government has agreed either wholly or in part with most of the Committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report was critical of the alleged failure of successive Australian Governments fully to ratify the human rights instruments to which Australia is a Party. Specifically, the Committee recommended that the Government act without delay to accept further optional complaint mechanisms provided for under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action in this regard has been taken since the Committee's Report was issued and this is detailed in the Government's responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia lodged declarations with the United Nations on 28 January 1993, accepting the optional complaint procedures under:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 14 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which provides for individual complaints of violations of the CERD;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which provides for State Party complaints of violations of the ICCPR; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Articles 21 and 22 of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), which provides the State Party and individual complaints respectively of violations of the CAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Report was also critical of the problems and delays associated with the consultative process with the States. One of the major themes of the Report is the belief that States' rights in the consultative process must no longer impede the ratification of outstanding articles in relevant international human rights treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCFADT's recommendations also cover human rights training, the use of Official Development Assistance for the promotion of human rights, military exports and the development of regional human rights forum. The Government has agreed either wholly or in part with all of these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not agree with two recommendations which specifically relate to an increase in resources in my Department for the handling of human rights and the reinstatement of annual human rights reports from diplomatic posts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe resources currently dedicated to human rights in the Department and posts are adequate. The Department already devotes substantial resources to the advancement of our human rights policy and is able to satisfactorily meet the demands placed on it. The Human Rights Section is adequately staffed and is supported by the Human Rights and Social Unit within DFAT's Legal Office. Human rights policy is also dealt with extensively in the geographic Divisions within the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any increases in resources and activity in this area, although I regard it as a very high priority for the Department's work, would have to be at the expense of other high priority issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annual human rights reports from posts would only duplicate detailed work done by other agencies to which the Government has access. The Government is able to rely on usually accurate and timely information on country situations from such diverse sources as the US State Department's annual publication "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" and reports from organisations such as Amnesty International and Asia Watch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, many diplomatic posts are already heavily engaged in responding to requests from Canberra for information on individual cases forwarded to the Department from the Parliamentary Amnesty International Group, and other non-government organisations and members of the public. Posts also regularly report on aspects of human rights practice in most countries either when specifically tasked or in more general reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government will continue to record a high priority to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally. This position is based on the belief that the universal observance of the rights and principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other major international human rights instruments, would result in a more just international order, from which the security and prosperity of all nations and individuals would benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCFADT's Report, and the Government's response to it, reflect the leading role the Government has taken on international human rights issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, let me once again congratulate JCFADT on their report.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As stated in the Submission by the Attorney-General's Department to the Committee, dated 9 June 1992 proposes are being prepared for consideration by the Government on specific legislation to create a Commonwealth crime of genocide. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Genocide Convention Act 1949</EMPHASIS> gave approval for Australia to sign the Genocide Convention and notified its extension to Australia's external territories. Article V of the Convention provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Contracting Parties undertaking to act, in accordance with their respective Constitutions, the necessary legislation to give effect to the provisions of the present Convention, and, in particular, to provide effective penalties for persons guilty of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Article III".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article III states that genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, direct and public incitement to commit genocide, an attempt to commit genocide and complicity in genocide are acts that shall be punishable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In meeting this undertaking, Australia has relied on the view that the obligation to legislate does not require the creation of a specific offensive genocide, but maybe satisfied by the provisions of State and Territory criminal laws. This view apparently accords with the practice of most other State Parties to the Convention and provides no basis for criticism from other countries that Australia is in breach of the Convention. A United Nations survey in 1978 found that most States regarded their constitution or "ordinary" laws as sufficient to prevent and punish genocide (see Study of the Question of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, E/CN.4/Sub.2/416, 4 July 1978, at para 551).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in 1969 and 1987 the United Kingdom and the United States passed legislation dealing specifically with genocide. The Inter-Parliamentary Union, and its 86th Conference in Santiago in 1991, passed a resolution calling on all sovereign States to enact the necessary legislation for the implementation of the Convention. The Gibbs Committee, in its final report on the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, was of the view that Australian law as regards the Convention was unsatisfactory and recommended that legislation be enacted along the lines of the United Kingdom act "to implement fully Australia's obligations under the Convention".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of these developments, the Government will soon be considering the options for specific legislation creating a Commonwealth crime of genocide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS> The Committee recommends that the declaration regarding Article 4(a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination should be withdrawn forthwith.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agree in part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Comment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before Australia can remove its reservation to Article 4(a), legislation is needed to create a criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred, either nationally or in all jurisdictions. The Commonwealth proposed to create an offence of incitement to racial hatred in the Racial Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill 1992. That Bill was introduced into Federal Parliament on 16 December and left to lie on the table for public consultations to occur. The Bill was the subject of a major round of consultations during January and February including public meetings in each capital city and in Townsville, Alice Springs and Launceston. The legislation received a mixed response. A report on the consultations is presently being prepared for the attention of the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS> The Committee recommends that the Australian Government should act without delay to accept further optional complaint mechanisms provided for under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Convention Against Torture and other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1990 Cabinet established an interdepartmental Task Force to review 74 (later increased to 75) International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions which Australia has not ratified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The four Conventions cited either Joint Committee and Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade were amongst those considered by the Task Force. The position in respect of each Convention is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">C135, Workers' Representatives, 1971.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Convention was ratified by Australia on 26 February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">C141, Rural Workers' Organisations, 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Western Australia (1992), the Australian Capital Territory (1992), Victoria (1992) and South Australia (1992) have formally agreed to ratification of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be full compliance in all jurisdictions, and all jurisdictions apart from the Northern Territory have intimated that they should be in a position to agree to ratification in the near future. The Northern Territory indicated that they probably would not be prepared to agree to ratification until the CAI complaint to the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association relating to the 10,000 member requirement had been resolved. This matter has now been resolved and the Government has announced that it will amend the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations Act 1988</EMPHASIS> to remove the requirement for an organisation of workers to have 10,000 members to be eligible for registration under the Act. This should remove any impediments that the Northern Territory has to ratification of the Convention. The Government hopes to be in a position to ratify C141 in the reasonably near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">C151, Labour Relations (Public Service), 1978</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales law and practice appears to be in compliance. However, concerns about ratification have been expressed by the New South Wales Government on the basis that they might wish to adopt certain policy initiatives which might move New South Wales out of compliance. In November 1992 clarification was sought from NSW Government but no response has been received. The Government hopes to be in a position to ratify C151 in the reasonably near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">C169, Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, 1989</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No State or Territory has agreed at this stage to the ratification of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A draft law and practice report has been prepared in consultation with Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities outlining in detail the degree of compliance by Australia and the Convention. In addition, the views of non-governmental organisations and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are being sought concerning possible ratification of the Convention. A decision as to whether Australia will ratify the Convention is expected to be made during 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsibility for preparing these reports is divided between Commonwealth Departments and practices with regard to consultation vary. Substantial consultation already occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is responsible for the preparation of the reports under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Department liaised extensively with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in the preparation of the most recent CERD report (Ninth Periodic Report). The Department will institute more formal consultation with NGO's on the preparation of future ICSCR and CERD reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department is responsible for the preparation of reports under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Forms of Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Attorney-General's Department intends to call for submissions from peak human rights organisations in relation to Australia's third report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and is considering the possibility of circulating the draft report to such organisations for comment. In relation to Australia's first report under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the States and Territories were asked to consult relevant non-government organisations in their jurisdictions while preparing their input to the report. Due to resource restraints only some of the States and Territories were able to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of the Status of Women (OSW) is responsible for the preparation of the report under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). NGO's are consulted as a matter of course in the preparation of Australia's CEDAW Report. During preparation of Australia's second periodic report, OSW and the National Women's Consultative Council (NWCC) convened, in June 1991, a day-long meeting with a wide range of NGOs and representatives of Commonwealth Departments to discuss aspects of Australia's implementation of the Convention and to allow NGOs to express their views and areas of concern. These were incorporated in the preparation of the final report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the recommendation to present reports to the Joint Committee and to table reports to Parliament and would have no objection to their publication in the Parliamentary Papers series. It would also be valuable to make them more widely available by distributing them to interested agencies and libraries and making them generally available in government bookshops. More extensive publication would, of course, depend on the availability of resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7</EMPHASIS> The Committee recommends that the Government reinstate the annual human rights reports from Australian diplomatic posts and urges the Government to make provision in resources and training to officers of the Department to enable them to carry out this task.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where they exist, regional arrangements complement both United Nations machinery and national institutions. They also offer valuable opportunities for sharing national experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, although Europe, the Americas and Africa have regional human rights mechanisms, there is no such body in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent developments internationally towards the establishment of national institutions, and growing cooperation among those institutions, may foreshadow the establishment of a regional or sub-regional human rights body. We were encouraged by the concluding remarks made by Chairman Wiryono (Director-General for Political Affairs, Indonesian Foreign Ministry&mdash;DEPLU) to the Second Asia-Pacific Workshop on Human Rights, convened in Jakarta in January 1993 under the auspices of the United Nations and the Indonesian Government, and attended by thirty government delegations representing almost every nation in the Asian region. The Chairman's concluding remarks endorsed a step by step strategy to establish machinery for the promotion and protection of human rights in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forthcoming World Conference on Human Rights, to be held in Vienna 14-25 June, provides an opportunity to explore practical ideas for promoting and strengthening national institutions, and submitting recommendations regarding the role of national and regional organisations in the promotion and protection of human rights.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Australia enjoys a very close relationship with Papua New Guinea, the Australian Government has made it clear that this does not exempt Papua New Guinea from Australia's universal human rights policy. Accordingly, the Government has taken every opportunity to raise, at the highest level, allegations of human rights abuse in Papua New Guinea, including on Bougainville. Where these allegations have been specific in time and place and able to be checked, Australian Ministers have drawn them to the attention of the PNG Government, asking that they be investigated and that those involved be disciplined. The Australian Government was encouraged by the previous PNG Government's announcement that it intended to establish a coronial inquiry into death on Bougainville and by the Wingti Government's acceptance of a proposal for a European Community/Africa, Caribbean and Pacific Joint Assembly (EC/ACP) fact-finding mission to visit the Province.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the recommendations on Bougainville made by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in its December 1991 report, "Australia's Relations with Papua New Guinea", the Australian Government maintains its position that Bougainville is an internal problem for the PNG Government. lt can only be solved through a political settlement reached by Papua New Guineans themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has recognised the importance of keeping open channels of humanitarian assistance to Bougainville. The Australian Government has urged the PNG Government to do all it can to restore services on Bougainville, including by improving access for NGOs and the Red Cross. Since May 1991, and in addition to our assistance to Papua New Guinea through budget support, the Australian Government has provided $620,000 in humanitarian aid to Bougainville. This has included drugs, gardening tools, shelter material and transport assistance. The Australian Government is willing to examine sympathetically further requests to help meet the needs of Bougainvilleans, including aid to rehabilitate areas of the Province where conditions have stabilised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The equipment and material provided by Australia to Papua New Guinea under the Defence Cooperation Program is to help the PNG Defence Force (PNGDF) carry out its nation-wide tasks, rather than for any specific situation, such as Bougainville. Apart from the provision of the Iroquois helicopters, for which conditions of use were agreed between the two Governments, it is up to Papua New Guinea, as an independent and sovereign country, to decide where and how its defence assets are deployed to carry out national security functions. Papua New Guinea understands that Australia expects the equipment we have supplied to be used in a way which is consistent with the purposes for which it was given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of the Iroquois helicopters used in operations on Bougainville, clear conditions of use apply. These provide for the helicopters to be used for troop transportation, for patrolling and surveillance activities, and for medical evacuation purposes, and allow for defensive fire from the helicopters for self-protection. We have sought, and received, assurances from the PNG Government that these conditions are being adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and Papua New Guinea continue to explore ways in which Australian aid can be used to enhance the protection of human rights in Papua New Guinea.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that sustained pressure by the international community has been an important factor in the improved performance of the Sri Lankan Government on human rights. Australia coordinates its action on human rights in Sri Lanka with that of other concerned governments, including Canada.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Government policy is to recognise States, not governments. This policy has been in place since January 1988 and is consistent with the practice of other major western countries. Australia recognises the State of Burma, and thus supports its right to a seat at the United Nations. This does not in any way imply Australian Government approval of the policies of the Burmese State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) regime or the manner by which it acquired and has retained power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Least Developed Country (LDC) status is granted by the United Nations on the basis of whether a country meets a reasonable balance of economic criteria as specified by the United Nations, notably a GDP of US$423 per capita or less in 1989 prices and a share of manufacturing in GDP of 10 per cent or less. Burma meets these and other economic criteria for LDC status: GDP per capita has remained at approximately US$200 for the last several years, and manufacturing accounted for 9 per cent of GDP in 1990/91.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no precedent for the withdrawal by the UN of a country's LDC status on political or human rights grounds, or for reasons of government policies on military expenditure. It is highly unlikely that a proposal to withdraw Burma's LDC status would succeed in the United Nations. It would be opposed by most, if not all, developing countries, particularly because of the precedent which withdrawal of LDC status would set.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1988, the Australian Government has banned the provision of bilateral development assistance to Burma. The Australian Government has not sought to stop UN assistance to Burma but has supported moves to re-direct UN assistance, specifically that provided by the UN Development Program (UNDP), away from longer-term development objectives in favour of support for humanitarian activities which are designed to help the Burmese people at the "grass roots" level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most UN assistance to Burma is now directed toward humanitarian, rather than long-term development objectives. UN expenditure in Burma over the three year period 1993-95 is expected to be US$49.98 million (compared with US$73.4 million for 1988 alone). Of that amount, approximately 71 per cent or US$35.5 million is to be expended by UNDP and UNICEF whose programs are predominantly humanitarian in character.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost all of UNDP's infrastructure projects have been stopped or significantly curtailed since the decision by the 39th UNDP Governing Council in May 1992 (supported by Australia) that UNDP funds assigned to Burma be de-committed, and that the released funds be used to implement projects likely to have greater impact at the "grass roots" level, particularly in respect of minority groups, indigenous peoples and the poor. Consequently the bulk of UNDP's US$20.5 million allocation for 1993-95 has been earmarked for poverty alleviation activities, HIV/AIDS projects, primary health care and community-level education.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US$15 million allocated to Burma by UNICEF for 1993-95 is to be disbursed on child health care (particularly immunisation) programs and other small scale, village-based projects.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UN Drug Control Program (UNDCP) has a projected expenditure in Burma of US$6.9 million for 1993-95 for narcotics supply-demand reduction, law enforcement and regional programs (14 per cent of total UN expenditure in Burma). Given that most of the illegal drugs which reach Australia originate in South East Asia's "Golden Triangle" area which includes parts of Burma, the Australian Government supports the work being undertaken by UNDCP in Burma and neighbouring regional countries to reduce the production of and trafficking in illegal narcotics. UNDCP is taking a rigorous approach to working with the Burmese Government on narcotics control. No UNDCP funds are provided to the Burmese Government and firm conditions regarding the provision of assistance have been established.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining 15 per cent of UN funds for the period 1993-95 (or US$7.4 million) is to be disbursed by a range of UN specialised agencies, many of which are in the process of winding down their involvement in infrastructure projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has implemented a unilateral embargo on trade with Burma in defence related goods. We have also urged other countries known to export arms to Burma, particularly China, to discontinue such exports. The Burmese Government's recent announcements concerning political change and releases of political prisoners have forestalled international pressure for UN trade and arms embargoes. There is currently no prospect of such proposals gaining enough support to be effective. Burma's major trading partners in the region, particularly China, are unlikely to support such measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia supported UNHCR in its efforts to gain access to Burmese refugee camps in Bangladesh, and continues to support the establishment of a UNHCR presence in Burma to monitor the repatriation process. UNHCR has advised the Government that it is currently satisfied with the extent of its access to Burmese refugee camps in Bangladesh. While there were reports of some involuntary repatriations of Burmese refugees from Bangladesh in late 1991, UNHCR has indicated that subsequent repatriations from Bangladesh have been made on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has on a number of occasions sought and obtained assurances from the Thai Government that there will be no forcible deportations from Thailand of Burmese political dissidents. In fact, although most Burmese students and dissidents in Thailand are technically illegal entrants, there have been no recent incidents of forcible return of Burmese students and dissidents, or of people from ethnic minorities in Burma seeking refuge along the border with Thailand. The Government of Thailand has sought to respond to international concern by establishing a safe area for Burmese students, but very few students have entered the area to date. The Australian Embassy in Bangkok is in regular contact with the Thai Government and UNHCR regarding the situation of Burmese groups and individuals in Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of a Special Assistance Category (SAC) for Burma was approved in August 1992. The SAC allows for the entry of up to 250 Burmese into Australia as permanent residents during the 1992/93 program year. The SAC will remain open at least until the 250 places are filled. In order to qualify applicants must be Burmese citizens who are resident in Burma and who have been subject to "substantial discrimination" in their home country. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is currently drafting an additional regulation expanding the SAC to allow for the entry of 50 Burmese from Thailand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs agreed in November 1992 to the drafting of a regulation to allow for the entry into Australia of up to 10 displaced Burmese students living in Thailand. The 10 Burmese students will be selected for study in Australia under an AIDAB-funded scholarship program. The Australian Embassy in Bangkok has received approximately 250 applications for #he scholarships, and it is expected that the successful students will commence their studies in June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Austrade Office in Rangoon does not actively promote Australian trade with Burma but responds to enquiries from Australian companies. Closure of the Austrade office, which is staffed by two locally engaged Burmese, would be a logical step if implemented in the context of internationally coordinated trade sanctions.

Senator Evans also invariably raises our concerns, and specific detainee cases, at any of his meetings with his Vietnamese counterpart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns about specific cases are normally first raised at officials level, with the emphasis being on detainees with family or other connections to Australia, the rationale being that this provides the Government with a useful locus standi.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1986 the Philippines Government has taken a number of concrete steps towards better protecting human rights in the Philippines. This includes establishing the Philippines Commission on Human Rights (a separate Constitutional body) and continuing dialogue between the Philippines Government and non-governmental organisations interested in human rights issues. The 1987 Constitution contains substantial guarantees of fundamental civil and political rights, and laws passed in June 1991 mean that all cases involving human rights violations by military personnel are now prosecuted in civilian courts. These developments have contributed to a declining trend in human rights violations in the Philippines with the number of new violations reported by the Philippines Commission on Human Rights (CHR) falling from 1,795 cases in 1988 to 1,142 cases in 1991, a 36 per cent decline.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has made clear that it has looked to the Administration of President Fidel Ramos to sustain the gains made by the Aquino Administration in the area of human rights. In this regard it is encouraging that President Ramos has pursued broad policies of national reconciliation, including legalising the Communist Party of the Philippines, concluding a cease-fire agreement with the ultra-rightists and steps towards the commencement of dialogue with Muslim separatist groups. The process of national reconciliation has made headway in generally reducing the intensity of the insurgency. However the military&mdash;both the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP)&mdash;continue to prosecute counter-insurgency operations in various parts of the country, including in Mindanao against Muslim rebels, and the several insurgent groups remain active. To help stem the continuing, but declining, incidence of human rights violations the Australian Government has funded human rights courses for Philippine military and police trainers. To complement the training program, the Australian Government funded the International Committee of the Red Cross to supply human rights texts to Philippine military and police schools, individual units and military and police trainers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the downward trend in human rights violations in the Philippines, elements of the security forces continue to commit human rights abuses (albeit fewer) in the course of the counter-insurgency, as do insurgent forces. Principal human rights abuse by government forces against individuals include extrajudicial killings (324 cases in 1992), arbitrary arrest (142 cases), disappearances (29 cases) and torture (10 cases). Only a very small proportion of suspects in human rights abuses are punished. Since 1986 the Philippines Commission on Human Rights recorded 7,789 military and police personnel as suspects in human rights cases (949 in 1992), yet only 53 military and police personnel have been convicted of human rights abuses between 1986 and mid-1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a strong supporter of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and seeks to convey this view to foreign governments. Australia ratified the Convention on 17 December 1991. The Philippines acceded to the Convention on 26 January 1990. Articles 19 and 34 of the Convention expressly provide that States Parties undertake to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse, including through the adoption of appropriate domestic and international measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government takes very seriously the issue of child sexual exploitation and paedophile activities. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) is presently monitoring the nature and extent of paedophile activity overseas and AFP liaison officers in Manila are working together with local law enforcement agencies. The Attorney-General's Department is examining possible legislative options to tighten controls over paedophile activity by Australian nationals overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and the Philippines are both active members of the International Labour Organisation, the paramount concern of which is social justice and the promotion and protection of the human rights and fundamental concerns of labour.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Foreign Affairs and senior officers of the Embassy have made our concerns on human rights violations in Tibet known to the Chinese on a number of occasions. The Government remains most concerned about the repression of religious freedom, cultural identity and freedom of expression in Tibet. At the 48th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR48) in 1992 Australia co-sponsored a draft resolution which expressed continuing concern over the human rights situation in China, specifically including Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government continues to believe there would be considerable value in representatives of the PRC Government and the Dalai Lama meeting, without excessively restrictive preconditions, to discuss the situation in Tibet, with a view to resolving the tensions there.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia welcomed Syria's lifting, in April last year, of discriminatory restrictions on travel abroad by Syrian Jews. We had for many years been concerned that the Syrian Jewish community was subject to significant human rights restrictions, particularly a ban on whole families emigrating. Prior to the easing of restrictions, the Australian Government made direct representations to the Syrian Government through our Embassy in Damascus on the circumstances of members of the Jewish community. These issues were also raised at Ministerial level in 1984 and 1988, and by Senator Evans during his visit to Syria last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October last year, the Government became concerned at reports that the issue of exit visas to Syrian Jews had ceased. Our Embassy in Damascus made enquiries about the cessation and was informed that the non-issue of exit visas was the result of administrative delays and did not reflect a change in the Syrian Government's policy about the emigration of Syrian Jews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is of course not accepting the reported explanation of the Syrian Government as the end of the matter, and, through our Damascus Embassy, we are keeping a close watch on the situation. Our Embassy recently reported that a small number of exit visas are being issued, which would confirm the Syrian Government's explanation of a slow-down rather than a cessation. Should further evidence arise that the delays are continuing, the Government will consider making further representations to the Syrian Government to urge that any Syrian Jew who has been denied an exit visa be issued with one without further delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Salman Rushdie</EMPHASIS> It seems to the Committee that Salman Rushdie deserves the same international outcry and international pressure to be brought to bear on the regime that has imposed the death sentence on him as was devoted to the other hostages in the Middle East.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans raised the Rushdie case with the Iranian Foreign Minister Dr Velayati and with other senior Iranians during his visit to Tehran in May 1992, and again on 11 May 1993 during a visit to Australia by the Deputy Foreign Minister of Iran, Mr Sarmardi. Senator Evans made clear our belief that the Rushdie fatwa will remain a serious obstacle to closer relations with Iran&mdash;a point which the US, EC and Canada have been emphasising with increasing strength in recent months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia co-sponsored the Resolution on Iran adopted on 10 March 1993 at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva (CHR49). The Resolution expressed grave concern at "continuing threats to the life of a citizen of another state", which, in multilateral terms, constituted an unmistakable condemnation of the fatwa against Rushdie. Western Governments may now seek to include references to this matter, either explicit or implicit, in future Resolutions in the General Assembly and possibly in other UN bodies. Australia would support efforts in this direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sudan</EMPHASIS> The Committee believes that the situation in the Sudan is an issue which must be raised again in the General Assembly and recommends that course to the Australian Government. Australia signed the anti-slavery conventions as the first of the international conventions it signed in 1926.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia co-sponsored a strong resolution on the Sudan at CHR49.

Earlier, Australia had supported successful action to move debate on the human rights situation in the Sudan from the closed to the open sessions of the Commission. This has had the effect of giving greater exposure to the human rights and humanitarian crisis in the Sudan and places further international pressure on the government of Sudan to improve its human rights record.</PARA>

In view of the continuing seriousness of the human rights situation in Guatemala we supported a consensus resolution at CHR49 that proposed moving consideration of this country to Item 12 (Country Situations) from Item 19 (Advisory Services in the field of human rights), a move which allows for greater UN scrutiny of the human rights situation in Guatemala.</PARA>

I do not wish to deny Senator Spindler the opportunity to have an inquiry on any issue that is of particular interest to him. What I object to is the title of this document, which is `independent inquiry'. I believe the word `independent' is entirely misleading. I think it is a pity that Senator Spindler indulged in stunt politics on this occasion. It is a Democrat inquiry, not an independent inquiry. I think it is a pity that Senator Coulter and Senator Kernot agreed to the use of this title because I believe it is extremely misleading.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I spoke on this matter the other night when Senator Spindler sought leave to table the document. I said that I did not challenge his integrity or his attitude to the question of tariffs in conducting the inquiry and in preparing a report. I do not agree with much of it, but the bulk of it clearly sets out to follow the terms of reference that he set himself. But that is not the point of what we are discussing. I cannot find one word in this document that indicates that it is a report of an Australian Democrat committee. In that respect it differs markedly from a normal parliamentary report. Any parliamentary report that I have seen in the time that I have been a member of this chamber also indicates who were the people on the committee and lists their parties and affiliations. Nowhere does this document set out who were the members of the committee conducting the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter of whether or not the Clerk said it was all right. I accept what the Clerk said, but I do not agree that the title on the front of the document, `Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into Tariffs and Industry Development', conveys to a person just looking at the document what the Clerk was talking about. Unfortunately, the Clerk here in the chamber cannot speak for himself, so I shall refer to the letter. On the face of it, to any person outside this building and to a number in it, that would be taken to mean that it is an independent parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that it is an Australian Democrat inquiry, and I am not suggesting that there is any bias in it at all; that is for the reader to determine. There is in the document a copy of a tabling statement of Senator Spindler's dated 22 April 1993, and the fourth paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event the Clerk of the Senate confirmed that an individual Senator could initiate and run an independent Parliamentary inquiry. I am grateful for the support from industry associations. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Turning to page 1, paragraph 1.3, the report says, under the heading `Basis for establishment of Independent Parliamentary Inquiry':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the rejection of his proposed Senate Select Committee on Tariffs, Senator Spindler obtained advice from the Clerk of the Senate that it would be "well within the scope of your duties as a member of the Senate" for Senator Spindler to use his parliamentary facilities to conduct an inquiry into tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA>I would think that no senator could dispute that statement that he was, as a member of the Senate, entitled to use his facilities&mdash;his office, his paper allowance, his everything&mdash;to conduct an inquiry. But it is not the same as saying it is a parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Acting on this advice, Senator Spindler announced his intention of conducting an independent parliamentary inquiry into the issue. I think one could challenge the `independent' because it clearly is an Australian Democrat inquiry. And why should they not conduct an inquiry?  But they should call it an Australian Democrat inquiry, not an independent parliamentary inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we come to the correspondence with the Clerk. There is a letter dated 26 May from Senator Spindler to the Clerk and there is a letter of the same date from the Clerk to Senator Spindler. Senator Spindler says to the Clerk:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to proceedings in the Chamber during the adjournment debate last night when the Coalition refused leave for me to formally table the Final Report of the Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into Tariffs and Industry Development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason given was the use of the term `Parliamentary' on the grounds that the Inquiry was not established by a resolution of the Senate and as a result, hearings did not attract parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>That was one of the things mentioned. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I have accepted this restriction and have at all times informed witnesses that they are not enjoying parliamentary privilege when giving evidence, it is my contention that the use of `Parliamentary' is purely descriptive; ie, it is stating the obvious fact that the Inquiry is being conducted by members of Parliament.</PARA>

Its success in seeking cooperation on common problems and issues, not only among member states but also with other countries in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond is strongly supported by Australia. Australia's future is linked to Asia and Australia is actively seeking to integrate itself further in the region. As part of this process Australia wishes to encourage and support more interactions between our peoples at all levels of society to continue to build the people-to-people bridges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meetings of organisations such as AIPO which bring together in a bipartisan way members of parliaments of the Asia-Pacific region are significant reinforcers of our linkages with ASEAN. As parliamentarians we represent various sections of our communities and, through the parliamentary process, provide input to the policies of our governments. I commend the recommendations of the report to the Senate, in particular those relating to the main purpose of our visit, the 8th AIPO conference. I draw the Senate's attention to the recommendations concerning the nature of future Australian parliamentary representation at AIPO, in particular the proposals for continuity of representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation has recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade respond to the Parliament within three months of the tabling of this report in relation to those recommendations of particular significance to that department. In addition to attending the AIPO conference, which was the main purpose of the delegation, we arranged a number of significant appointments in Indonesia and made bilateral visits to Papua New Guinea prior to the conference, and Thailand, with the assistance of the parliaments and Australian posts in each country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation arrived in Papua New Guinea on 16 September 1992, the 17th anniversary of Papua New Guinea's independence. We were thus able to attend the Independence Day celebrations, such as the flag raising ceremony at Independence Hill, and meet Prime Minister Wingti and members of the new Government. During periods when the delegation was not required at the AIPO conference, we met with the presiding officers of the Indonesian Parliament and a number of Government Ministers including, for example, Home Affairs Minister Rudini and Transmigration Minister Soegiarto. Following the AIPO conference, the delegation made a bilateral visit to Thailand and became the first delegation from another country to meet the new presiding officers, other parliamentarians and members of the new ministry following the September 1992 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before closing, I wish to draw the Senate's attention to one particular matter on which the delegation had made recommendations to alleviate perceived problems. That matter is the degree and quality of support services, including briefings, provided to the delegation by the Australian post in Jakarta, which the delegation believes bears improvement. We held a debriefing session with the department shortly after our return at which we raised our concerns. We have taken the step of also mentioning these matters in our report in the hope that the problems we experienced will be addressed in the appropriate way by the department. We await with interest the full response by the department to the matters raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One further matter on which I wish to comment briefly is the production of this report by the Senate publishing and printing units. I have been informed that the final section of this report was passed to the printing unit at 8.30 last night and that copies were produced within the hour. On behalf of the delegation, I wish to thank sincerely Mr Gordon Kimber and his staff, in particular Ms Jill Manning in the publishing unit and George Kuleas and Michael Marshall in the print shop, for their assistance in the production of this report in what I know is an extremely busy and testing period.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pursuant to the resolution of the Senate of 5 May 1993 establishing the Committee now known as the Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies, which required the Committee to report by the end of each Session of this Parliament, I wish to report to the Senate on the work of the Committee so far.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was established to continue the work of the Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies, as recommended by that Committee in its last report, which was presented on 3 May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's terms of reference require it to inquire into and make recommendations on the fundamental question of applying community standards in the context of existing classifications to the new electronic information and entertainment services of: pay television (whether delivered by satellite, microwave, cable, or UHF/VHF); telephone message services; telephone video and videotex services; video games; or services accessed through personal computers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 13 May, the Committee held a public hearing, at which the Australian Broadcasting Authority was questioned on the research program it was required to carry out under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</EMPHASIS>, on community standards of taste and decency in relation to classifications for pay television.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABA responded to concerns the Committee had expressed in its report presented on 3 May. Those concerns related to the way the ABA research program had been designed and was being carried out. The qualitative phase of the research program had been undertaken without consultation with the Committee. The Committee had therefore requested that the research program be halted until it had adequate opportunity to comment on its design.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the hearing on 13 May, the ABA informed the Committee that the second, qualitative phase of the research program had been halted pending the outcome of the Committee's consideration of the qualitative phase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABA has supplied the Committee with all the information requested following its hearing on 20 April 1993. This included the audio and video tapes relating to the qualitative study performed in March and April 1993; the full research brief as set out in the ABA's contract with the consultants, Keys Young; a description by Keys Young of the rationale and methodology applied during the qualitative phase of the research; and an interim report by Keys Young summarising the results of the qualitative phase and identifying the key findings and the implications for the next phase, the quantitative research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Susan Young, of Keys Young, attended the hearing on 13 May to answer questions on the research program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee intends to give consideration to the information it has received during this month on the ABA's research program, and to make recommendations for improvement to the program, with a view to its early resumption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impending introduction of pay television demands that the research program on standards be completed satisfactorily as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also took evidence during this month on standards for video games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 May a public hearing was held at which a major distributor of video games, SEGA-Ozisoft Pty. Limited, provided information on recent and prospective developments in video games technology, and on means of ensuring their compliance with accepted community standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Video games are not currently classified by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. At its meeting on 23 June, the Council of Attorneys-General will consider a recommendation from the Australian Law Reform Commission that video games be classified by the OFLC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told at the hearing on 20 May that technologies such as CD ROM/Multimedia, Virtual Reality and Holograms would spread quickly into homes around the western world during the balance of this decade, and would take many people by surprise as to the nature of these systems and the power of the new entertainment forms which they provide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike movies, videos, TV, pay TV or any other form of passive entertainment, this form is interactive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">regulated violence and sex has been part of the passive entertainment or other publishing industries, and it will become part of the interactive industry. Therefore, appropriate controls and standards will need to be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Committee was re-established on 5 May, its terms of reference were broadened in response to community concern, to enable it to inquire into the problems posed by rapid developments in electronic and telecommunications technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is now calling for submissions from individuals and organisations in the community who are interested in expressing views or providing information on video and computer games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee intends to report on this matter by December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continued scrutiny of telephone message services formed the focus of a hearing held on 26 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the hearing, the Committee heard allegations that Telstra (formerly AOTC) might be involved in running and receiving payment from explicit sex telephone message services through OTC Australia's 0011 international STD service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian telephone message service providers drew to the attention of the Committee advertisements for sexual fantasy recorded messages of the kind which had been condemned by the Committee, and had now been abandoned by Australian message service providers and forbidden by Telecom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The services were advertised as being available on international lines from Portugal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra representatives questioned subsequently at the hearing told the Committee that the Portuguese international telecommunications carrier had been requested, when it had first asked for access to Australia for those lines in November 1992, that Portuguese telephone message service providers be informed of the obligation to comply with Telecom's 0055 Code of Practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecom told the Committee that it would be requesting the Portuguese carrier to terminate immediately any services which did not comply with Telecom's Code of Practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telstra was also investigating technical means of barring access to the particular international telephone numbers which had been identified as being in breach of the Telecom Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee intends to hold a public hearing in Sydney on 8 June, at which Telecom would be questioned on further action it could take on regulation of international services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole question of regulatory bypass&mdash;that is, the ability to circumvent national controls on the content and standards of television and radio broadcasts and telephone services by going outside the national jurisdiction&mdash;will be a focus of the Committee's inquiry in the months to come.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pay tribute to my Tasmanian colleague and friend Senator Shirley Walters on her retirement, a senator who has been a member of this chamber for 18 years. Shirley Walters first became a senator on 1 July 1975, during the heady days of the Fraser Government and the double dissolution. Senator Walters, after leaving us, will have become the fourth longest serving female member of this chamber. She will join the annals of great women from both sides of the chamber such as Dame Dorothy Tangney who served for 25 years, Dame Annabelle Rankin who served for 24 years and Dame Ivy Wedgwood who served for 21 years. Shirley, you are in great company and we all salute you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters can certainly be said to have followed in her father's footsteps. Her father, Sir Eric Harrison, a founding member of the party and deputy to our great leader, Sir Robert Menzies, served for 25 years in the other place as a member for the seat of Wentworth. Her father's example and training have been evident during her 18 years in these hallowed halls. Senator Walters has shown herself to be a tenacious, hard working senator who leaves no stone unturned in her desire to obtain the best not only for the people of Tasmania whom she represented but the families of Australia in general. I think we were all very touched, Shirley, by your comments tonight about the poetry of your father. I think there were many of us who actually had a tear in our eyes because, indeed, he would have been very proud of his great daughter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, Shirley, your abiding passion to do what is right in health, welfare and social issues, in family areas, has seen you join such committees as the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare and estimates committees soon after coming to this chamber. Your commitment to committee work, attending where at all possible every meeting called, earned you the role of the chairmanship of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare in November 1990 when Senator Peter Baume became Minister. Shirley held this position until 1983 when the present Government came to power. I recall a moment given to me by another colleague of Shirley's on the social welfare committee: you could always count on Shirley to be at any committee meeting called because she took her job so seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, whilst in opposition, Shirley's interest in community affairs and social welfare earned her the vice-chairmanship of, at first, the social welfare committee from 1983 and, when it changed its name, of the community affairs committee in 1987 until the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such reports as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The other side of the drug debate</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Homeless youth</EMPHASIS> were produced while Shirley was chairperson of the social welfare committee. The report on homeless youth gave a clear and incisive look into why we have so many of our youth on the street. The myth that homeless youth were merely undisciplined children not wishing to come under the umbrella of their parents was clearly broken, as the report clearly showed, and it also showed that the main cause of homeless youth was sexual, physical or verbal abuse inflicted in the home. To escape this, the teenager would leave and thus end up on the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The other side of the drug debate</EMPHASIS> was another myth breaking report examining the abuse of prescription and over-the-counter drugs that occur within our country. This report was but the start of Shirley's endeavour to do as much as possible to encourage this Government to implement measures that will rid this country of the prevalence of drug abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her input to the social welfare committee did not stop when she became part of the Opposition. From what I have been informed, at all times Senator Walters was in attendance using her quick and agile mind to draw out the best from the witnesses called. The reports when presented were concise and resourceful. The report dealing with employment for the disabled is a good example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on Senator Shirley Walters's committee work, we must not forget that she was also a member or a chairman of various Senate select committees covering the social welfare issues. For example, on coming here Senator Walters was able to make use of her nursing and medical interests on the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes. During the years of the Fraser Government she was chairman of this committee, and then she was vice-chairman whilst in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other Senate select committees of note that she served on were the industrial relations legislation in 1992, volatile substance fumes from 1984 to 1985, video material during the same years, and the Human Embryo Experimentation Bill from 1985 to 1986. So it is a tremendous record. It has been said that it was her active involvement and attendance at committee hearings which gave her the background information she needed to ask such incisive questions whenever the estimates were in progress. Many a bureaucrat has felt the keen edge of Senator Walters's mind and questioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I leave her committee involvement, it must be mentioned that she was also active on several joint select committees. Her active participation in the inquiry into the Family Law Act from 1979 to 1980 and the inquiry into video material from 1985 to 1988 has been well recognised. It was as a result of Shirley's work on this last mentioned committee that she introduced her private member's Bill to reduce the amount of violence permitted in video classifications for mature and restricted audiences as well as prohibiting the sale and hire of X-rated videos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill covered one of the recommendations of the report from the inquiry into video material which the Government did not adopt. Thus Senator Walters was able to overcome the lack of action from this present government and, at the same time, respond to the considerable concerns within the community about the increasing incidence of violence as well as sexual violence in videos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Criminology has noted that on the figures of rape alone there has been an increase of 159 per cent in 10 years. Disappointingly, the Government and the Democrats failed to support her private member's Bill. Instead of allowing a vote to be taken, the Government filibustered until the time for debate had ceased. In today's climate when violence is seen as second only to unemployment as the main issue of concern to voters, it is disappointing to see a government which is not prepared to support this important Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters is indeed an all-rounder. Not only is she an active member of this chamber but her energies extend to the party room and to her party. Of particular note was the fact that she was Parliamentary Secretary to the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr John Howard, from April 1987 to May 1989. It was a tribute to Shirley that John Howard was in the chamber when the main valedictories were given tonight. During that time, her advice on the status of women, family issues and community and social welfare issues was often sought. I would have to say that all party members would hold Senator Walters in high regard for her knowledge and championship of women's issues. Throughout her parliamentary career, Shirley has always been a champion of the women in Australia. When she leaves this place the women of Australia, and especially the family women, have lost an important voice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a fellow Tasmanian and Liberal, I can comment on her involvement in the party at the State level. She will be a loss to the party in Tasmania. From the early days of her entry into the Senate, Senator Walters proved herself a popular and tireless representative. She entered the chamber in the No. 5 position 18 years ago and it soon became apparent that the No. 1 position was for her. She has constantly led the Tasmanian Senate team to victory from that position thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shirley has set the standard for what is expected from a Liberal politician in Tasmania. She is conscientious in all facets of her work, and when it comes to meeting the people within her electorate I find no fault. If there was a branch meeting or Liberal Party function called, Shirley was always in attendance if possible, and this was in addition to attending every community activity wherever possible. Shirley Walters has an exceptional ability to be able to explain party policy and action in a simple, down-to-earth manner. During the lead-up to the last election and while it was in progress, Shirley Walters was a tireless speaker and worker. </PARA>

You have done a great deal in your life and you have achieved a lot in the Senate. I simply say: all the best in your retirement and may it bring you as much happiness and joy as your 18 years in this place have brought you. Thank you for your contribution. </PARA>

In fact if they had gone with him then, the economy would have been in a lot better shape today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will always remember Senator Walsh. The assistant Black Rod had to go and get him from his office one night in the old House. I must admit, he did return to the House at some stage, but the assistant Black Rod, Mr Cleaver Elliott, was in a very shattered state when he got back with the said Minister. I will always remember Senator Walsh for that. I do not agree with some of the things that he is talking about at the moment. One of them, of course, is the reintroduction of inheritance tax or the reintroduction of death duties. I abhor the fact that that was quoted of him in the papers today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Walters gets that deep voice of hers and starts to rumble along, you always know something is going to come out of her lips that is very worth while.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do think that when she says she will give somebody a bit of a shot, or fire a couple of guns, she gives more than one barrel; she gives both, and a couple more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing I will probably remember you most for was when I was the only person of the male gender on the private hospital and nursing homes inquiry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one person I have to say more about is Senator Bjelke-Petersen who is undoubtedly a legend in her own lifetime. She is much more than a pumpkin scone baking, ex-Premier's wife, as I think everyone in this place has found out. Basically, she is as soft as butter, but she can be as tough as teak. I have had a few encounters with Florence Bjelke-Petersen in our party room and I can tell you, she is pretty tough. This is no more epitomised than by what her daughter said about her in the following article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My daughter Helen was interviewed and asked what it was like to have a dictator as a father. She looked at them and laughed, saying that dad was the soft one in the family, mum was the hard one. I suppose that came about because I was both mum and dad, and I believed in strict discipline.</PARA>
<PARA>That, definitely, was Flo. In her maiden speech she said a couple of things which I do not think have been quoted here tonight. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite claims to the contrary, the family still remains the best way of caring for Australia's children and guiding them to adulthood.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend her for that, and I think she has stuck with that principle the whole time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She is a lady of strong Christian faith. Senator Florence has always maintained high moral standards, and I am sure she will continue to do so for the rest of her life. She stands as a colossus. She stood by those standards which are so hard to hold up in this day and age. I believe her willingness to stand up for what she believes is a quality which set her apart from most other politicians in this place. Her speeches were always about ordinary people and the people she represented, and I think that is absolutely magnificent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Florence had an ability to make a very successful career for herself without losing her values and beliefs about the importance of a woman as a home maker. As a politician, I believe she has excelled. When we think about some of the remarks that Senator Walsh threw at her at different times and the way that she had to take the flak that was being thrown at her husband, I really admire her because not many other people in this place have had flak being thrown at their husband or wife while having to sit through it. She has to be commended for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bjelke-Petersen shared her pumpkin scones with the royal family. The recipe she talked about here today got her $1,000. I think the handwritten recipe was worth $1,200. I was at an auction with her one day where she sold a handwritten recipe for $120. An unsuccessful bidder came up to her after this guy had paid $120 for the recipe and said, `I would have loved to have got that recipe but I could only afford $110'. Instead of saying, `What about a donation of $110?', she said, `Don't worry, love, I'll write one out for you and send it to you in the mail next week'. I do not know how that made the other guy who had paid $120 feel, but that was Lady Florence Bjelke-Petersen to a tee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I most admire Senator Bjelke-Petersen, as I said, for the way she took the flak from Senator Walsh. Her ability to take shorthand was something that put her above any other politician in this place. The fact that she could take down everything people were saying about her and then quote it back to them straight away, standing up in this place, was magnificent. Another attribute is the Flo and Joh show. The Flo and Joh show will continue. They have been one of the most popular political duos in Australia's history and I believe it will continue as well. Florence Bjelke-Petersen has done much for Australia and Queensland and the people she represents. She has taught me many things. She is a remarkable woman. Florence, your presence in this place will be missed. </PARA>

He said, `Don't worry, you haven't said anything defamatory; it is common practice by this individual to threaten to sue people'. It was all right for him; he was not about to lose his house. In retrospect, the counsel was very wise. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came in here, Austin Lewis was the shadow Minister for industry, technology and commerce. I have always said that Austin called a spade a shovel. I can very well recall his tackling Senator Button with great gusto because he recognised the fact, which Labor governments often do not recognise, that governments cannot pick winners. I can remember Senator Lewis attacking Senator Button for attempting to pick winners. People should realise that companies are very expert at picking winners, and a lot of them go bust, too. As sure as the sun rises and sets, governments cannot pick winners. One of the nice things I found out from Senator Lewis is that he is retiring to Queensland.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I would touch very briefly on Senator Peter Walsh. It was a great pity that Senator Walsh spoiled what was otherwise a very fine speech. But as you come so shall you go. Senator Walsh came in here and attacked the then government of the day. He had what he called a dirt file. I always thought that Senator Walsh had a great intellect and he did not need that to make his point. I believe he would have achieved a lot more without it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first experience with Senator Walsh was on Estimates Committee C with my colleague Senator Brownhill. We were a little bit in awe of Senator Walsh because we had heard all the stories about him. In practice, even though he had a lot of the bravado, a lot of the thumping of the chest and a lot of the macho image, he could in fact be a pussy cat. I have to say this about him because of his remarks. I can recall that on an estimates committee there was a certain Democrat who had the habit of driving us all nuts, as they all do from time to time. This fellow used to come in with piles of pieces of paper. He was not on the committee. I will not mention his name. He would come in and Senator Walsh would abuse the hell out of him so that he would start trembling at the lips and he would put all his questions on notice and go away. But the next day he would come back with another pile of questions. I recall one day Senator Walsh scribbling on a piece of paper which came down to me from the attendant, and it said, in a sort of pathetic way, `I've tried being rude to this bloke. What do I do next?' I can recall writing on the bottom, `Try harder, Peter; I know you can'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh likes to look on himself as being a Chifley type of Labor person.

From all the readings I have done on Senator Walsh&mdash;and he writes under the name of Cassandra in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;it seems like he opposes the wastage of middle-class welfare, he opposes government waste, which came through very strongly on the estimates committee I was on with Senator Walsh, and he is very critical of the new class and those people in society who would like to see greater expenditure without development. My belief is that Senator Walsh has conned the media but he has not conned anyone in this place because we know that that is not the prerogative of left-wing socialists; it is more the prerogative of the Liberal Party. So perhaps we might lay that one to rest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Western Australia, the most distant State from this national capital, there is a feeling in the community that we are neglected from time to time, that Canberra really does not care about what happens way over in the west. I know all of these Western Australian senators who are leaving us tonight, and relinquishing their positions at the end of next month, have done many things in their own ways within their own political parties, in government and in opposition, to ensure a West Australian position is being espoused within party rooms and parliamentary committees, within government and within opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three who are leaving are Senator Durack from the other side of the chamber, Senator Walsh from this side and my very good friend and close associate Senator Giles. Senator Giles is perhaps the closest of the three to me. She has made an enormous and immeasurable contribution in the Parliament to the cause of women in our community. It is a contribution which others have referred to and I would like to associate myself with the very good and kind remarks that have been made about Pat, remarks which are true in every sense of the word. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it on the record that although people tend to think of Pat merely as an advocate for women, I know from my own experience, prior to my coming here and since my time here, that Pat, or indeed her office, does not necessarily turn away men who are in difficulty and who need political advice. She serves the whole of the community but puts a huge emphasis on redressing the imbalance against women in our community. She has made a contribution but obviously there is a lot more work to be done in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Durack is a person whom I hold in high regard. Many kind words have been said about Peter. He is indeed one of nature's gentlemen and it has been a pleasure to be associated with him and to work with him in this place. Even though I did not have the intimacy of serving on parliamentary committees with him, I am aware of the work he has done in that area. I have previously referred to the fact that he has represented his State over a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first association with Peter happened in the mid to late 1970s when I was a trade union activist and there were coalition governments in power in Canberra and in Western Australia. Because of my trade union activities I got arrested on two occasions. The then State Liberal Government, under Sir Charles Court, decided to enact an infamous section of the police Act of the State, section 54b. I got arrested on two occasions for engaging in activities which are now quite legal and quite lawful, but the government of the day chose to use those powers in another attempt to crush the union movement. The union movement of course has survived that attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Durack was then Attorney-General and I recall very vividly the then Premier announcing an inquiry into the validity of this particular section of the West Australian police Act. I recall that the Premier announced that he was going to have two very distinguished Western Australians examine the implications, one of whom was Senator Durack. I did not know him personally; I did not really want to know him from the comments that my colleagues in the trade union movement were making about him at the time. I am happy to record in the early hours of this morning that the comments made at that time were not necessarily true and it has indeed been a pleasure to serve with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have saved words about Senator Walsh until last. Even though Senator Durack serves on the opposite side of the chamber, I have had more conflict with Senator Walsh than I have with Senator Durack. Senator Walsh is somewhat of a legend now because of his work and activities as Minister for Finance and for some of his other utterances as well. The left wing of the Australian Labor Party, with which I am proud to be associated, had cause on a number of occasions when Peter was serving out part of his distinguished career as Minister for Finance to take him to task and make some perhaps disparaging remarks about him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Walsh's contribution to Western Australia and to the parliamentary processes I think will be recorded in history as something that has been very productive, not just on behalf of the people that he represented. I do believe that he has a huge social conscience and a huge heart that has kept driving him forward to represent people who are not quite as advantaged as some others in our society. He is somewhat of a legend from Western Australia and it is a pity that he is leaving us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, joy comes with retirement as well. He has told me quite confidentially that he is going to do nothing in his retirement and that in the past few weeks and months he has been practising that.

I think he will be remembered for the good work that he has done in this place rather than for his bitterness. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first knew him when we were in the great Junior Farmers debating team, led by his brother, then himself and a woman from Hines Hill whose name I cannot remember. It was a great debating team. We eventually moved on to join the Western Australia Farmers Federation, as it is now known. The first three speakers on any motion used to be John Walsh, Peter Walsh and John Panizza in about that order. We stirred that place up. It was only a haven for would-be Country Party politicians.

I think the only `oncer' was Mr Tony Whitlam, and he was a member of the Labor Party. Not one of us was a `oncer'. Shirley's departure means that Brian Archer is the only person elected on our side in that climactic election in 1975 who has consistently served in this chamber. I think Senator Colston and Senator Harradine and three others in the other place were also elected at that time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a few words about Senator Florence; the woman I refer to as my grandmother. When I came into the chamber I was sitting next to Julian McGauran who had this particular seat here. Somebody made a comment that we were Ernie and Bert. Senator Boswell was in front and Senator Bjelke-Petersen was at the back with Senator Sheil. It was like three generations of the National party, with dad down the front, the kids in the middle and the grand folks up the back. Senator Sheil, who was an old boy of my old school, the Southport school, left soon after and that just left grandmother. It has been a great privilege and a great pleasure to serve with Senator Florence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tell honourable senators about the human side of this lady, because she has an immense capacity not just to relate to people but to remember them; and honourable senators know how difficult that is. I thought that maybe it was as a result of all those years as a Premier's wife that she knew everybody in Queensland, but about two or three years ago I took my mother's former primary school headmistress, a Catholic nun, Sister Juliana, up to dinner in the dining room because she was coming back from a retreat.

Senator Flo turned to her and said, `Now, what order are you with, Sister?'. Sister Juliana told her. She then asked, `What convent are you at?'. She named a convent in Sydney. Senator Flo then proceeded to say, `Well, you would know Sister So-and-so and Sister So-and-so'&mdash;and at that point I gave up. I knew there was no way I could ever compete with Senator Bjelke-Petersen's prodigious memory for people and her capacity not just to talk to people and to relate to them but to memorise what they had to say and to really take note. </PARA>

When constituents criticise this place harshly on the basis of what they glimpse in this chamber from the TV or from the gallery, I tell them about the excellent work of the committee system. Firstly, our Shirley, with whom I served on the select committee on community standards, has kept the interests of women and family to the forefront during her career. In her maiden speech she spoke for all Australian women in the home. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is undeniable that the continuance of a stable society means stable citizens, and stable citizens come from a stable family background.</PARA>
<PARA>It is with these principles in mind that Shirley has carried out her work in the Senate. As a newcomer to the Senate in 1991, I joined with Shirley on the community standards committee to carry out a limited inquiry on fantasy phone calls on 0055. A staffer of mine at the time warned me that I would rue the day that I joined such a committee because of its membership and its particular terms of reference. My staffer said that this hearing and committee will just go on and on, and it certainly has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is during this time that I have really come to appreciate Shirley's tenacious qualities. We work very well as a team and have taken part in many fiery hearings. Even the ABC TV cameras turned up to last week's hearing. They probably came because they heard a rumour that the last hearing's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record had been wrapped in clear plastic sealed with an R-rated certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The valuable work of this committee has broadened in scope, and Shirley has been extremely anxious that when she is no longer a member of this place her very valuable work will continue. Now that Senator Herron and I will be carrying this on, she can be assured that it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I turn to Senator Sowada. In 1991 upon hearing that the Australian Democrats had chosen a 28-year-old archaeologist in the Senate to replace Paul McLean, I had mixed feelings. However, through her work in this place Karin has shown that her research experience has given her great insights into the needs of the education sector. Senator Sowada stated in her maiden speech in this place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we want to become the clever country, education must not be regarded as a burgeoning budget item, but rather as an investment in our country's future, in our young people and in the intellectual and scientific base of business.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement is very true and Karin can be proud of the fact that she has worked constantly to see this attitude accepted in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Karin has worked tirelessly on many issues on the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. In the last two years our committee has produced a number of landmark reports including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Come in Cinderella</EMPHASIS> on adult and community education and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanted: our future</EMPHASIS> on youth unemployment. I would particularly commend her work on the education committee since the election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite the fact that she will not be continuing past June, she has worked to ensure that the committee is well placed going into the winter recess with its very important mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer particularly to the establishment of the committee's latest inquiry into the future of universities and the research program. Karin is working on this right up to the last minute. She lobbied very hard for university research to be the next reference and was very keen to see that the terms of reference were expressed correctly&mdash;a real professional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I also worked closely on committee work with Senator Terry Aulich, who was the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Together with Senator Sowada, we made a great tri-party team. In fact, the committee was able to be very effective in producing a number of highly influential reports and this occurred in no small measure because of the chairmanship skills of Terry Aulich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terry is a true believer in education and this has been reflected through his dedication to the work of the committee. His previous profession as a teacher and six years as the Minister for Education in Tasmania has meant that he has always been aware of the issues involved. But you could not ever call Terry a government man.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New directions in higher education</EMPHASIS>, was a landmark in its field, pointing out very clearly the deficiencies of the mess created by Mr Dawkins's national unified system&mdash;a disastrous experiment in higher education that we have been inflicted with over the last seven years.

She makes you feel proud to be a Tasmanian. I think every Tasmanian admires her stand on family issues.</PARA></TALK.START>

You rang me one night, when the bells were ringing, and told me that you only had to come here for 22 weeks a year. I do not think that was quite true. Nevertheless, I have certainly enjoyed your company. I enjoyed our mad escapades around Tasmania. I was driving the bus with you and Jocelyn in it. Jocelyn was saying turn left and you were say turn right; so the only option I had was to go straight ahead. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter that I will discuss briefly. I am sorry, everybody is waiting to go home. I refer to a report that was tabled today&mdash;a summary of the inquiry into the accident involving No. 75 Squadron FA18 Hornet A21-41 at Tindal in 1991. I wanted to say a few words about it tonight because it may be too late next session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This accident concerned an old school friend of mine. It was his son that was killed in this accident. Peter Conroy grew up in Tasmania. Michael Tate may have known him, because they went to the same school. The plane has never been found and neither has the late Cameron Conroy. The family is still very anxious to know what happened to Cameron and the plane. The inquiry found that the most probable reason for the accident was that, unknown to the pilot, the cabin pressure switch was not set in the right position; the pilot removed his oxygen mask for comfort purposes and other non-medical reasons; and, as a result, in an unpressurised cockpit, he suffered hypoxia leading to unconsciousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this inquiry, actions have been taken to make conditions better for future pilots. Measures have included installing a cabin pressurisation warning system, fitting an electronic locater beacon so that if a plane crashes it can be found, and reviewing the RAAF aviation medicine training scheme. It is unfortunate that these things have to be rectified after an accident which caused so much pain to someone's family, a family which is so anxious about finding its lost loved one that it is still contemplating whether to finance a private search. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at Tindall last year speaking to the RAAF personnel. Group Captain Moat, the commander of that base, still regrets that they have not been able to find Cameron. He is most concerned that a training exercise in Weipa which could have used the Army to look in areas where Cameron might have crashed was aborted. He felt that perhaps the exercise should have continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also unfortunate that Cameron only received&mdash;and Senator MacGibbon has explained to me the ins and outs of this&mdash;one course on the use of pressurisation. The refresher course he was supposed to take, along with his colleagues, was 12 months overdue at the time of the accident. I think this is an indictment of the penny-pinching attitude of the Government towards this squadron because pilots are allowed to fly only 175 hours a year. It is believed that that is not sufficient time to give the pilots the training they need. The reason Cameron was not sent to Point Cook for that updating of his medicine training was that the cost of flying him to Point Cook from Tindall seemed to be too high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most unfortunate that this accident happened. Perhaps some good may come out of the inquiry. I hope that some time in the future, both the plane and the late Cameron Conroy will be located. When that happens it will put to rest the anxious moments and the grief that the family is suffering. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join my colleagues and pay tribute to those senators who are retiring tonight. I include them all to start with, without naming them, because in the time available I can comment on only two or three. One thing that I found when I came here three years ago was that there was no shortage of people to give advice; what you had to do was sort out whether it was good advice or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jokes aside, I would like to pay tribute to Peter Durack, who served in this place for 22 years, particularly for those first two or three months when I was trying to frame my first question and do all the little technical things. I found your quiet, wise counsel invaluable. I will always appreciate that; thank you very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to Shirley. I think the first question she asked when I walked into this place was, `What are you going to do about the wool industry?'. I think the last question she asked in this place was, `What is going to happen to the wool industry?'. While she did not get the right answer from Senator McMullan, I can tell her that the NFF is appealing that 2.5 per cent decision&mdash;so you work until the end; but it has been a very enjoyable and fruitful exercise for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to combine my comments on what has been said tonight by Senator Panizza, Senator Walsh and Senator Austin Lewis. I do this for a very special reason. I first met Peter Walsh in about 1967 at a farmers union conference. I met John Panizza at about the same time. I first met Austin Lewis when we went up to a meeting at Merredin. Merredin is an interesting town. We also called in there on one of the education inquiries. It is an interesting town because, as Austin found out, it is no problem to get 600 or 700 farmers to a meeting at Merredin. There is a very simple reason. There are three factions there: one is the Labor Party, which is the Walsh-Chance faction; another is the Panizza-Patroni faction; and the other faction is that of Hendy Cowan, who is the Leader of the National Party. They always turned up together. I was very interested to hear John Panizza say that he and Peter Walsh sorted out the farmers union. Tonight is not the time to make a speech about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was when flying up to Merredin that I met Austin Lewis. I think that meeting was an experience for him. I do not think he had been out in that part of the woods before. When he came back here after that, he had certainly seen the problems that existed in the wheat industry. We had a number of conversations about it. I think we might even have corresponded. He came into this place and fought for those people whom he had met up there once and who did at that time have a particular difficulty. I thank Austin sincerely for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to make a couple of brief comments about Peter Walsh. There is no question that Peter Walsh, politically, had a very important role to play in changing the attitudes of farmers and how they go about running their businesses. At about the same time, a number of us&mdash;and I was a lot younger then&mdash;started questioning some of the old doctrine, which really revolved around maximising profits and socialising losses. Peter Walsh articulated that here in this place. A number of us articulated it publicly. From that, we started looking at some of our cost structures which were being socialised away in the process. I certainly recognised that, and I think that was a crucial part of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not comment tonight on Senator Walsh's speech, other than to say that I think one day he may wish that he had never made it. He certainly did make one important comment to me tonight&mdash;and I think now is the time to say it&mdash;when he acknowledged that the underwriting of the borrowings by the Government of the Wool Corporation increased the damage that occurred to the wool industry. That is the first time I have ever heard anybody on the other side of the chamber acknowledge that the Government accepted some of the responsibility for what occurred. I think that is a very important acknowledgment in terms of dealing with the problems we will have before us over the next year or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other person I want to briefly comment on is Pat Giles. I knew Pat Giles in a totally different capacity before I came here. There is one thing I will always remember about Pat Giles. It occurred about 2 1/2 years ago when I was flying home to Perth. It was at a very difficult time. It takes me 14 hours to get home from this place. I had had a couple of whiskies on the plane and I was getting quite upset and emotional. She started chatting to me because she was sitting beside me. I said, `I'm going home tomorrow to my second son, James'&mdash;who is now in New Zealand&mdash;`and we have to shoot 1,500 sheep'. That was a very difficult thing to talk about on a long trip. I just want to say thank you to Pat for the help she gave me that night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last two senators I wish to comment on, while also acknowledging the others, collectively, are Senator Aulich and Senator Karin Sowada. I want to do that in the context of the education committee, and I wish to make one particular comment regarding it. Last year we were working through the youth unemployment report, which I think has turned out to be a very good report. It is a very significant report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing in terms of that report was that at the end of the day, under Terry's chairmanship and after a lot of discussion, we all came to the conclusion that we had to put down a report that, if it were going to be effective, had to have some meaty recommendations in it. We all agreed to buck our own particular party lines a little bit to get to the final conclusion. I think that demonstrated that the committee system can work. But even further than that, at the end of the day&mdash;and John Tierney and Paul Calvert will remember this&mdash;those recommendations that we made became part of our policy when we went into the last election. So I think that demonstrates something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, I wish to pay tribute to Lady Florence for her friendship and her contribution to this place and also for her wise counsel. I would like to conclude my comments by saying to all the people who are leaving us here tonight:  au revoir, bon voyage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak, but following Senator Calvert's remarks in relation to the loss of that Hornet I feel moved to expand on that topic. He said he discussed something with me. What I discussed with him was the actual pressurisation techniques. I had no knowledge that that pressurisation course was 12 months out of date or anything like that. That is information that Senator Calvert supplied, but perhaps I might seek the indulgence of the Senate to comment for a few minutes on those two reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They deal with serious matters, two fatal accidents with the loss of two lives and the total loss of two aircraft. The first point I would like to make is that the reports are summaries only and they are therefore of limited value unless they are read in conjunction with the full and unabridged report. The best summaries can give an accurate resume of what happened but frequently with summaries they can intentionally or unintentionally give the wrong impression, because of their brevity, as to what went wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment I would make, having read a number of other RAAF summaries of accidents in recent years is that they tend to be bland and uncritical. They do not attribute any censure to the personnel involved. That is a very wrong way to go. One simply cannot operate that way in aviation. Analysis must be ruthless and the correction that is necessary as a consequence of that analysis must also be ruthless. At the end of the day the RAAF in the first instance has to accept responsibility for these accidents and, beyond the RAAF, of course, ultimately the Government must accept the responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the loss of this Hornet, the aircraft has never been found. What happened was that the aircraft went out on an exercise that involved a low-level phase and returned back to Tindal at 33,000 feet. At 21,000 feet the pilot made his last radio call. The aircraft levelled out at 28,000 feet for a short while, so presumably the pilot was conscious at that time, and then resumed the climb, presumably on autopilot. It flew through the assigned altitude of 33,000 feet, climbed out to 46,000 feet and disappeared towards Cape York. It was presumed to have expended its fuel somewhere in the region of Weipa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry showed that one of the possible causes was an unawareness by the pilot that the pressurisation of the cabin had not taken place. The very fact that this gets such emphasis in the report as the first matter mentioned means that the inquiry must have had some evidence to think that might have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point made is that the pilot had his mask off. In those circumstances, in an unpressurised aircraft at altitude, the loss of consciousness from hypoxia is something that occurs without any prodrome or warning at all. One just loses consciousness. It does not matter how alert one is, the loss of consciousness just occurs in an imperceptible and quite rapid way. That is why it is such a dangerous thing and why pressurisation courses are held and pilots and air crew are made aware of the need to monitor constantly their oxygen flow at altitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aircraft was never found despite an extensive search, and the report hints at the need to fit electronic locater beacons to aircraft. These are simple and cheap locaters costing a few hundred dollars which have been used by the general aviation community for at least a decade. I can understand the RAAF not being keen to fit these because, if one loses an aircraft to enemy action, the last thing one wants is that aircraft or the site of its crash being identified by a beacon because it means that someone on the other side can find that aeroplane and get to it first and get any information from its equipment. But that problem is easily overcome by having an arming switch in the cockpit so that the locater beacon will not go off if one does not want it to. The other problem with an electronic locater beacon is that it can transmit accidently and one does not know it is transmitting unless one searches for the signal. But it is transmitting on known frequencies and, with a VHF radio in the aircraft, it is very simple to tune in on that channel and hear the signal if it is transmitting. I think it would be a very good move for the services to have ELBs in their aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we come back to the two important points raised: the lack of knowledge of whether or not the aircraft was pressurised; and the fact that the pilot had his oxygen mask off. The first point suggests very strongly a lack of familiarity coming from lack of recency in flying experience. It is unfortunately true that the pilots in the FA18 squadrons are flying only about 175 hours a year, and that does not provide enough experience for a multi-role aircraft of the complexity of the FA18. To be competent, those pilots have to fly at least 22 hours a month&mdash;preferably 24 to 26 hours a month. On the other point on the lack of recency of pressure chamber experience, I do not know the precise details. Senator Calvert said that it was 12 months overdue. But that really is something that can be done very cheaply and does not involve anything much at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other widespread story that was in the press at the time was that the pilot had a habit of flying with his oxygen mask off. That is something that is not mentioned in the summary of the report and we do not know whether it is true or not. But the fact that it was reported in the press leads me to assume that there may have been some substance to it. If that happened, then we have to say that there was a lack of discipline and that the more senior officers in the squadron should have laid down the law and that should not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second accident that we have relates to the loss of a P3C Orion which again was a total loss of the aircraft and in which, unfortunately, one person was killed. There is another point with this that is rather sad because 10 squadron, the squadron that lost this aircraft, is one of the really great squadrons of the RAAF&mdash;a squadron that has been operating heavy long-range maritime patrol aircraft exclusively for 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened here was that this aircraft departed Cocos Island presumably to fly back to Australia for Learmonth or Edinburgh. The Orion P3C is a heavy aircraft and, with the equipment load, the anti-submarine electronic equipment in it is really quite heavy. To fly from Cocos back to Australia it would have been close to its maximum all-up weight: somewhere around 130,000 pounds weight, somewhere around 65 tonnes. The aircraft took off, climbed to 5,000 feet and came back for an over-fly of the airstrip at quite high speed. The report says that the aircraft flew at about 380 knots, which is about 430 miles an hour, which I would have thought was pretty close to the VNE of that aircraft, at a height of between 300 and 400 feet. Then it initiated a sharp pull-up, it climbed, and the report estimates that the G-loading on that aircraft was at least 3.4 G. It may possibly have been higher than that because there is no way it can be recorded. But the fact that the report put a figure of 3.4 in suggests quite strongly to me that that was at least the minimal figure obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the pilot did was something that is as old as time itself: of beating up an airfield on departure. The fact that the aircraft was flown at a high speed and at a low level is not necessarily dangerous in itself, but it is not good practice and in this case it was specifically banned both under the squadron general flying orders and under the orders of the maritime patrol group. So there was a flagrant breach of discipline in the fact that the aircraft was flown at high speed at a low level up the strip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that was not the thing that caused the accident. The great error of judgment was a very savage pull up at the end. This aeroplane would have been still close to its maximum all-up weight of somewhere around 130,000 pounds, I would assume. Subjecting that to a G loading of about 3.4 G, I would think probably put it pretty close to the maximum design load of the aircraft. That means that a 60-tonne aeroplane became, in real terms, an aeroplane weighing 200 tonnes. In that circumstance, great structural loading is placed on the airframe and it is very likely that something is going to break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two points here: the rate of application of the load&mdash;and there was a very rapid application of the load here&mdash;as well as the absolute dimension of the load itself. Quite bluntly, it was a very stupid manoeuvre. There is no excuse or reason for doing anything like that at all. There is absolutely no point in it. It might be one thing to fly up an airstrip at a high speed and impress people with one's skill that way, but the aeroplane could have been climbed out gently, rotated into a climb. If that had happened, with smooth hands, all of those people and the crew would have been here today and we would have an aeroplane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By fighter pilot techniques, a 3.4 G loading is nothing. Most of the exercises flown by pilots in FA18s routinely pull about 6 Gs and sometimes they even go to 9 Gs. I do not doubt that there are times in a P3 when pilots are doing anti-submarine attacks where they are pulling a G loading of probably about 3 G or something like that. I have flown in those exercises both at night and during the day and they can be pretty violent manoeuvres. But there is a reason for those manoeuvres to be performed in an anti-submarine exercise. Like all flying operations, it is a percentage game. One does not put oneself in a position where one takes unnecessary risks. What was done here was simply very bad airmanship. One of the basics of airmanship is to have smooth hands; one does not load an aeroplane up unnecessarily. A particularly violent pulling up of a heavily loaded transport aeroplane like that or an aeroplane corresponding to a transport aeroplane is just inexcusable. It is no wonder that something happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings attribute the accident, somewhat fuzzily, to pilot error. The findings comment on the aerodynamic factors which may have been relevant, but those are clearly secondary. Attention is also drawn to what may have been a manufacturing deficiency with respect to the thickness of the ribs in the leading edge section. That may have been a predisposing factor but, again, it is a secondary consideration at this time. Under the heading `Other Conclusions', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a fly-over departure was not included in the flight authorisation;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the Wing operations officer was deficient in his executive responsibility . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There were three pilots on board, two captains being on the flight deck. There was a fully endorsed training captain qualified for flight from the right-hand seat. The captain, who was flying the aircraft in the left-hand seat, was also an experienced captain. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While neither pilot acted negligently in undertaking what was intended to be an impressive, but nevertheless within published limitations, low fly-over, both showed a lack of professional wisdom and professional responsibility . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They lacked wisdom in what they did. These two men were captains; they were not just pilots. As such, they were vested with the responsibility of the lives of everyone in that aircraft, the safe operation of the aircraft and the successful operation of the mission. These people are especially selected and trained by the Air Force. They are captains. I say this with great care: they simply did not exercise the responsibility that was vested in them. I find it astonishing that&mdash;as the summary states&mdash;all that happened to them was that formal counselling of the captain, the co-pilot and the flight authorising officer took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that we have here with these two accidents is that they are a consequence of the great loss of expertise in the Air Force in the last six to seven years. Sadly, they are not isolated examples. In the recent past, the Royal Australian Air Force has had a relatively high fatal accident rate. It is interesting that the United States air force throughout the same period has shown a diminution in its accident rate but, unfortunately, ours has gone up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, in the recent past, we have lost over 400 pilots out of a pilot pool in the Air Force of roughly 750. In 1985-86 we lost 70 pilots; in 1986-87, we lost 107 pilots; in 1987-88, we lost 123 pilots. That is a loss of 300 pilots in just three calendar years. The people we lost were the highly experienced pilots, the experienced flight lieutenants, squadron leaders and wing commanders, the people who had the body of experience in the Air Force. That loss rate has to be compared with the long term loss rate for the RAAF of only 47 pilots per year. Six or seven years ago when this loss rate was going on, I said that it would take us 15 years to replace that experience in the Air Force because it cannot be generated overnight. I said that, sadly, we would pay a price for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These accidents are part of that price and they are not the full price. We will pay more for the loss of experience from the Air Force in the middle to the late 1980s. It may be that my estimate of 15 years to replace that experience is an optimistic one, because when I made that estimate the number of pilots and the number of hours being flown were far higher than they are today. Since then, we have seen the hours of squadron pilots reduced from 24 to 26 hours a month to 175 hours a year, which is inadequate. Not only that, we have seen the squadron manning strength of pilots reduced from about 18 to 12. So we have fewer pilots getting less experience, and there is simply no substitute for experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I regret that these reports ever came before the Senate. I think they are a great tragedy because we have lost two good Australians in the prime of their lives. We have lost two fine aircraft, with probably a replacement value of $200 million. I find it sad to say that we have lost those aircraft basically because of the general run-down in expertise and experience within the defence forces today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate for very long. I want to put on record a few comments about the election that is now well and truly behind us. I would like to raise some concerns which I have. My concerns were first raised when a letter arrived on my desk from an elderly constituent who was quite upset about having received a letter from the Australian Electoral Commission alleging that she had voted more than once. For this elderly lady, this allegation was quite a shock. Not surprisingly, it did upset her. She promptly informed the Australian Electoral Commission, however, that she had in fact voted on only one occasion at one polling booth on 13 March.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On taking up the issue with the AEC, I was quickly told how easy it is for such a mistake to occur. Since the electoral rolls are now electronically scanned using all sorts of new technology, apparently it is easily done. The computer picks up a small mark on the roll which points to the fact that a person has voted more than once when, in fact, that person has not. Could one person easily vote at different places using the same name without being detected until after the election? Or could someone have voted in her name at another polling booth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of my concerns is the number of provisional voters in certain electorates. Nationwide, the number of provisional voters in Australia was 0.42 per cent of the total vote, or 46,000 votes nationally. I would contend that this is enough votes strategically placed to win government for the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very short time between when the election was called and the roll actually closed&mdash;a period of eight days&mdash;450,000 transactions were recorded, which means there were 450,000 changes or additions to the roll in that period, the equivalent of about 54,700 changes per day. This figure included 35,000 new enrolments from 18-year-olds and another 150,000 new enrolments. I wonder how closely these new enrolments, particularly those people who had re-enrolled under a new address, were reviewed. I wonder whether there have ever been any habitation reviews done regarding those people who register at a new or different address, or those who register with a new or different name. I would suggest that there have, in fact, been no reviews, nor have there been any checks. In electorates which were decided by the smallest majorities&mdash;by only a few hundred votes&mdash;I think this is an issue which should be thought seriously about for future elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all due respect for the good work done by the Australian Electoral Commission, I simply ask how easy it would be for people to enrol using different names at different addresses within an electorate for the purpose of an election. Does anyone check whether this person exists or actually resides at the address on the electoral roll?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my knowledge, no such checks are carried out. The only checks are those overzealous computer checks which identify people who supposedly voted more than once, although one of my constituents will tell honourable senators just how accurate those checks were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the number of provisional votes recorded in the electorate of Page, which was won by the Australian Labor Party by the smallest margin of less than 200 votes, was 640 and, of those, almost 50 per cent were awarded to the Labor candidate, while the National Party candidate recorded just 20 per cent. In the Richmond electorate there was a similar story: 0.86 per cent of the total vote was provisional, although the Labor candidate scored more than 50 per cent of those provisional votes compared with the Nationals score of just 16 per cent. I present these remarks to the Senate not as outrageous allegations but as observations which I believe should be looked at before we have any further elections. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There has been one change in the definition of labour force status since March 1983 which affected the compilation of estimates of the numbers of persons employed, unemployed, and not in the labour force, with a consequential effect on the calculation of the unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The definition of employed persons was extended to include persons who worked without pay for between 1 and 14 hours per week in a family business or on a farm (ie unpaid family helpers). Previously, unpaid family helpers who worked for 1 to 14 hours per week, or who had such a job but were not at work during the reference period, ie were on holidays, sick etc, were defined as either unemployed or not in the labour force, depending on whether they met the criteria of actively looking for work and being available to start work. This change was made to align Australian labour force concepts with a set of changed international definitions prepared by the International Labour Organisation in October 1982. The changed definition was introduced in the April 1986 survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Application of the present definition had the effect of increasing employment for March 1986 by 34,800, and of decreasing unemployment by 5,300 in seasonally adjusted terms. The unemployment rate (seasonally adjusted) for persons based on the previous definition was 7.9 per cent in March 1986, while the unemployment rate for persons based on the present definition was 7.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The changes of definition that took place in April 1986 resulted in corresponding changes to the Labour Force Survey questionnaire. As a result it is not possible to produce data for June 1992 based on the previous definition for persons employed, unemployed, or not in the labour force, nor therefore the unemployment rate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The training in peacekeeping operations for Australian Defence Force personnel who are selected for service with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) is normally conducted over a period of about 15 days in Sydney. Occasionally, where the United Nations (UN) has requested that Australia provide personnel for UNTAC at short notice, as was the case with the Movement Control Group in May 1992, some Military Police personnel in April 1993 and more recently the Aviation Squadron Group, it has not been possible to provide personnel with the full regime of training normally conducted in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The ATO proposal stems from its responsibility to collect revenue as soon as practicable on or after the due date set by law. The timely lodgment of tax returns is a critical part of this cashflow management responsibility, and one in which tax agents have a major role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accepting that return preparation and processing volumes need to be managed, the ATO has for many years had lodgment programs in place for tax agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the ATO has noted that the flow of returns from agents was unevenly compressed into the last stages of the program regardless of the understandings with the profession that returns would be lodged progressively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATO has also noted that revenue collections from assessments have been slipping forwards into May and June over the last three years. Bringing forward the final dates for agent lodgments is a way of addressing this slippage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The ATO at present sees the bring forward proposals as the only way to address the revenue slippage. It acknowledges that the change will reduce by a fortnight the time available to agents to prepare and lodge returns; but notes that this outcome will still provide a less stringent program than has applied in the past. Also, the Commissioner is currently canvassing members of the national Tax Liaison Group (The ATO's peak tax profession consultative body) for alternatives to the bring forward proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. The changes are being considered, in part, because the flow of returns has been compressed into the last part of the lodgment year. The proposed dates will still allow agents to spread their lodgments over 8 1/2 months (9 1/2 for electronically lodged returns).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. The proposed changes will affect all tax agents in the same way, relative to their present operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The "reasonable care" standard assumes that taxpayers, assisted by their tax agents where applicable, take reasonable care in preparing their income tax returns.
