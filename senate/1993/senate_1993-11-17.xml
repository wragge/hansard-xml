<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee has noted that four of the instruments appear to be technically void or invalid, another may breach personal rights by discriminating against persons in a de facto marriage relationship, while four provide for important discretions which may not be subject to review of their merits by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DETERMINATION INS 21/1993 MADE UNDER S.4(1)(DD) OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH ACT 1953</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Determination, among other things, extends the list of institutions for which benefits are payable to recover the cost of supplying homograft items.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The part of the Determination that deals with institutions recovering benefits is contained in Appendix A. The Determination itself, however does not refer to Appendix A or, in fact, mention institutions at all. The Committee has written to the Minister asking whether the instrument validly effects its intention to implement Appendix A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MIGRATION (1993) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.235</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations, among other things, create a new class of entry permit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions expressly exclude a de facto relationship from the definition of marital relationship for that entry permit. The Committee noted that the principal Regulations generally define marital relationship to include a de facto relationship and has written to the Minister seeking an explanation for this exclusion. Advice has also been sought on whether the exclusion could be considered a breach of personal rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LIQUOR LICENSING ACT 1988 (W.A.)(C.K.I.) (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE 1993 TERRITORY OF COCOS (KEELING) ISLANDS ORDINANCE NO.7 OF 1993 LIQUOR LICENSING ACT 1988 (W.A.)(C.I.) (AMENDMENT) ORDINANCE 1993 TERRITORY OF CHRISTMAS ISLAND ORDINANCE NO.8 OF 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Ordinances amend the Liquor Licensing Act 1988 (W.A.)(C.I.) and (C.K.I.) in its application to the two Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are important discretions relating to club, hotel and restaurant liquor licences in new ss.4(1), 37(5), 50(4) and 63(2) of both Ordinances. The Explanatory Statements advise that there is a right of review to the Liquor Licensing Court of the discretion in s.4(1). The Committee has written to the Minister seeking an assurance that similar review exists for the other discretions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DETERMINATIONS NOS. T65/93 AND T68/93 MADE UNDER S.26 OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING ACT 1988</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Determinations determine expenditure for approved capital projects for specified institutions and vary funds for operating purposes for institutions throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Determinations, which reduce some amounts of expenditure, are expressed to operate from the date of making. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking an assurance that both Determinations were gazetted on that day, thus avoiding invalidity under s.48(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That subsection provides that provisions which prejudice any person apart from the Commonwealth are void if expressed to commence before gazettal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TRAINING GUARANTEE (ADMINISTRATION) REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.252</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations authorise the Minister to make decisions about recognised alternative training levy schemes and recognition for persons covered by such schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New r.2CC(7) provides appropriately for AAT review of these direct decisions by the Minister. There could, however, be disputes of fact under the provisions of new rr.2CC(5) and (6), even though those provisions are not drafted as discretions. The Committee considers that it may be appropriate to provide for review of decisions made under these two provisions and has written to the Minister accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK CORPORATION ORDER NO.M62/93 MADE UNDER S.16H OF THE AUSTRALIAN MEAT AND LIVE-STOCK CORPORATION ACT 1977</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Order sets out the principles for the allocation of quotas for meat exports to the United States of America for 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of New Exports Allocation in paragraph 1.1 appears as drafted to subdelegate to the AMLC itself the power to vary the legislated quota without making a fresh instrument under the Act every time it does so. This would appear to be invalid. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking an assurance that any variation of the quota from time to time will be made under s.16H of the parent Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 3.3 provides a discretion with the AMLC to vary a quota, expressed as `in its absolute discretion and without giving reasons'. The Committee notes that it is unusual to provide for a discretion worded in such a way, particularly as there are no criteria to guide and limit its exercise. In addition, the express provision that reasons for decisions need not be given would appear to breach the rights of those affected. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking an assurance that this wide power is either subject to AAT review or comes within Administrative Review Council guidelines for exclusion from such review.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That amendments 1 and 2 of the Schedule of amendments to the Nursing Homes Financial Arrangments Principles, contained in Principles NHP 4/1993, made under subsection 40AA(7) of the National Health Act 1953, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>In the 1990-91 budget the Hawke government announced that from January 1993 funding of workers compensation costs in nursing homes would be based on a state average. Previously, nursing homes had been fully cost reimbursed for workers compensation costs. State averages are calculated by adding all the workers compensation costs of nursing homes in a state and dividing this figure by the payroll. This figure is expressed as a percentage and each nursing home in the state receives workers compensation funding equal to that percentage of its payroll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If actual workers compensation costs exceed the funded amount, the nursing home must make up the shortfall. Alternatively, if the funded amount exceeds the actual cost, the nursing home keeps the difference. In response to concerns from the industry about administrative problems entailed in not commencing the change at the start of a financial year, their onset was postponed until 1 July 1993. The change was included in a special <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> on 28 June 1993. The amendments to the nursing homes' funding arrangements were tabled in the Senate on 27 June 1993 and are disallowable instruments under section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any explanation of why the coalition is seeking to disallow the amendments in this instrument must commence by stating that the post-election decision not to send this matter to the Gregory review is yet another of Labor's broken election promises. The government tried to quieten down the nursing homes by saying that something would be done about it after the election. The nursing homes were duped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an obvious attempt to take this contentious issue off the agenda during the campaign, Mr Staples advised the private and voluntary sectors in late February. A number of them told me that they had been told through telephone conversations that the changes to the workers compensation funding arrangements would be incorporated into the review of the structured nursing home funding arrangements, or the review that we more commonly know as the Gregory review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the 1993 election, as I have said, the new minister, Mr Howe, reneged on his predecessor's promise&mdash;workers compensation would not be part of Professor Gregory's review and the changes would start up as originally planned on 1 July 1993. Mr Staples's promise was made in the middle of the election campaign. It was a Labor election promise to the nursing home industry, which was unanimously opposed to this change. It was made for purely political reasons, to keep the industry quiet during the election campaign. Mr Howe's post-election reneging on this undertaking is, as I said, just another Labor broken election promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large number of objections to the changes have been put forward by nursing homes and their industry representatives. Many of these claims relate to the nature of the nursing home working environment. It is a difficult environment, as we all know. Those of us who visit nursing homes know some of the situations in which those dedicated staff work. It is difficult to protect against serious accidents due to catastrophic events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes through no fault of their own, residents of nursing homes do not always act in a way that is reasonable and safe. In addition, the main compensatory injury in nursing homes&mdash;that is, back injury as a result of heavy lifting&mdash;involves high claims. It is very prone to rorting, often recurs and it is very difficult to protect against these sorts of injuries, even with the very best work practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also argued that the proposed system will not necessarily reward or punish those homes that deserve to be rewarded or punished. A nursing home with a large number of small claims as a result of poor work practices may not incur as large a funding shortfall as a home that is unlucky enough to have a single major claim that has nothing to do with its work practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed average is a mean average. It is not a case of 50 per cent of nursing homes gaining and 50 per cent of nursing homes losing from the new system. I meant `mean' as in average&mdash;not `mean' in the other sense of the word. Analysis of a frequency distribution, which I have obtained through questions on notice, shows that 60 to 70 per cent of homes will get a bonus, while 30 to 40 per cent of homes will have a shortfall. The size of the shortfall that results from the use of this average is of concern, particularly in states where premiums vary significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, some 40 homes have premiums four per cent or more above the designated state average. With a payroll of $2 million, a 50-bed nursing home in this category is looking at a shortfall of $80,000 a year. Aged Care Australia has given examples of two Tasmanian nursing homes with premiums of $170,000 a year each being underfunded by $85,000 a year. Shortfalls of this size mean that other homes will receive quite significant bonuses. Aged Care Australia has given another example of a Tasmanian home with a premium of $13,000 a year that will get $53,000 in funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state averaging system is, by necessity, retrospective. The original averages are based on care aggregated module, or CAM, payroll figures in the NH20 returns for the 1991-92 financial year. The actual average will be calculated from the 1993-94 NH20s, and the difference between it and the amount paid to the nursing home will be recovered or paid via a loading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992-93 NH20 form and future NH20s will include an additional standard aggregated module, or SAM, payroll component so that the average is based on the total payroll. When fully operational, the system entails using the reconciliation from two years previous to determine an estimate of the current year's average, assessing the current year's reconciliation during the following year to redetermine that average and adjusting the amount paid to the individual nursing home commensurately. Aged Care Australia has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time lag may well be in the order of fifteen months before a nursing home knows whether it has made a profit or incurred a loss on workers' compensation premiums.</PARA>
<PARA>The Private Geriatric Hospitals Association of Victoria&mdash;PGHAV&mdash;has provided a detailed submission which argues persuasively that the interaction of the averaging system with the new Victorian work cover scheme may have major adverse financial repercussions if a nursing home suffers a serious accident amongst its staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work cover scheme is fully funded each financial year and interim premiums are adjusted accordingly. This means that, while the Commonwealth is recovering excess workers compensation funding, the Victorian government will be adjusting its interim premium upwards to take account of the claims experienced during the previous year. This means that, as the premium costs go up, the Commonwealth's funding goes down. The PGHAV claims that this will be very detrimental if a nursing home has a serious accident amongst its staff, especially highly paid staff in a small home, regardless of how well the home runs in all other aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other sources have expressed state specific concerns about the impact of the workers compensation changes. There are wide disparities in the premiums paid by nursing homes in South Australia, which also has the highest state average. This means that shortfalls and bonuses may be very large. The Commonwealth has already adjusted the Tasmanian average upwards as a result of concerns expressed by the industry. An actuary in Western Australia has argued that that state's average is one percentage point too low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Commonwealth has provided an exemption for transit accidents, the Victorian system does not cover such accidents. The Victorian system encourages claiming workers to make an early return to light duties. But the CAM funding system for nursing homes does not recognise light duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister claims that the industry has been given sufficient lead time since the change was originally announced in 1990 to improve its workers compensation claiming record. However, there is little evidence that the Commonwealth has acted positively to support such improvements. In answer to a question on notice, the government claims that it has funded a number of nursing home occupational health and safety related projects. However, closer scrutiny reveals that only three small projects have been funded, the earliest being approved in October 1992, two years after the original announcement in the 1990 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At ground level, there is virtually no evidence of direct assistance from the Commonwealth reaching individual nursing homes. Objective No. 7 of the nursing homes outcome standards states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nursing home environment and practices will ensure the safety of residents and staff.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the task of the standards monitoring teams to monitor and, if necessary, enforce these standards. However, to date, the department has not seen fit to extend the role of the standards monitoring teams by taking up opportunities to have an educational role in occupational health and safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In virtually all workers compensation systems, employers' premiums are directly related to their previous claims record. When a nursing home changes hands, the new proprietor inherits the old proprietor's good or bad claims record. More often than not, it is a bad claims record, particularly if the previous owner has had financial difficulties. This means that premiums may remain above the average for a considerable time, even if a new proprietor has impeccable workplace health and safety practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a nursing home which I visited in Tasmania very recently claims that it is facing a $60,000 annual deficit as a result of this change because its current high premiums reflect the poor practices of the previous proprietor. That just seems very difficult to comprehend. In this example, the new proprietor is also paying negative loadings incurred by the previous proprietor as well as undertaking expensive structural upgrading and replacement work on a property that was approved by the department as being okay for a nursing home. Apparently, it has quite significant structural problems. This change will be an additional significant burden. It will also act as a disincentive to purchasers taking over run-down nursing homes in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be stressed that only the government appears to be supporting the change. Since I have become shadow minister, this issue has been the subject of an ongoing campaign by the nursing home industry; it is an issue which inevitably comes up when I visit nursing homes. All three of the national industry bodies in the voluntary and private sectors are opposed to the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Hospitals Association, which represents state public nursing homes in that state, is opposed to the change. The Private Geriatric Hospitals Association in Victoria, the PGHAV, has provided an in-depth analysis of the change, concluding that its interaction with the Victorian system will have an adverse impact on its members. A number of individual nursing homes have expressed their concerns to the coalition either directly or through their industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this widespread concern, I wrote to the major industry groups in July asking them to provide alternatives to the government's proposed averaging system. I stipulated that the alternatives must entail an incentive to improve occupational health and safety practices. We are all agreed&mdash;the government, the opposition, the Democrats, and the industry&mdash;that there needs to be some checks and balances in there to encourage and improve occupational health and safety practices. The three criteria I gave the industry in July were that the alternatives must, firstly, entail an incentive to improve occupational health and safety practices; secondly, be revenue neutral; and, thirdly, be administratively simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All three national bodies stated that they were in favour of a system that would reward nursing homes with good occupational health and safety practices and penalise those homes with bad practices. It was not that they wanted to keep the system as it is, paying workers compensation at whatever rate it was. They realised that that was untenable and could not continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative put forward by Aged Care Australia best fulfilled the criteria that I had set out. It involved a weighted averaging system in which homes with costs above the average would receive funding at a rate above the average but less than their premium, while homes paying below the average would receive funding at a rate less than the average but more than their premium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar system based on tolerance levels was put forward by the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, while the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals put forward a more complicated alternative that took account of catastrophic events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without doubt, the change put forward by the government introduces a significant incentive into the workers compensation funding system for nursing homes. However, one must ask whether it is an appropriate incentive, whether it will reward and penalise the right people for the right reasons, and whether it will have any unintended adverse consequences for nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is questionable whether a nursing home should get a windfall from the government of up to $40,000 per year simply because it has a low workers compensation premium, regardless of the reason why it has a low premium. It is also concerning that a nursing home may be out of pocket to the extent of $60,000 a year as a result of claims that may be unrelated to its own occupational health and safety practices. It could be a catastrophic event that occurs. The nursing home could have had the best occupational health and safety practices in the industry and still be in a situation where it is likely to lose significant amounts of money. For many of those nursing homes, that amount of money actually threatens their viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not introduced the necessary safeguards into its averaging system to protect nursing homes whose viability is threatened by this system or which are financially disadvantaged by it for reasons which are beyond their control. There is no appeal mechanism. There are no exclusions for special circumstances, other than the $500,000 or above transit claim provision. There is little evidence that this highly regulated industry, which is almost wholly reliant on Commonwealth funding for its survival, has received sufficient support from the government since the 1990 announcement to improve its occupational health and safety practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worst of all, the post-election decision by the minister to commence this provision from 1 July without referring it to Professor Gregory's review as promised during the election campaign is a blatant example of how this government is quite willing to say one thing before the election&mdash;it said bald faced that there would be no new taxes and all pensioners would be taken out of the tax system&mdash;and then after the election change its mind. Exactly the same thing has happened in the nursing home industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite ought to squirm because this is the sort of thing that goes on all the time. People are gullible and they believe the government. They will not believe it next time. The government said to the nursing home industry that this matter would be sent off to the Gregory review. We believe that promise ought to be kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my notice of motion today, I gave the government the opportunity to abide by its election promise to the industry and refer this matter to the Gregory review. As the government has not seen fit to take up this offer, I have no choice but to move to disallow those parts of this instrument that refer to changes to the funding of nursing home workers' compensation funding.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will be supporting Senator Patterson's disallowance motion. Senator Patterson has covered virtually all the major concerns and in particular she has dealt with some of the financial difficulties that will be faced by the nursing home industry if this goes ahead. She has also covered much of the historical context of this difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern is that I really cannot see that these regulations will necessarily do anything to improve occupational health and safety in nursing homes, which is what we are supposed to be looking at. Although I fully appreciate that full cost reimbursement provides no incentive whatsoever for nursing homes to improve their work practices and their workers' compensation claiming records, I am not convinced that the measures in these regulations will actually act as an incentive. I think the government is proposing to use a very blunt instrument which ultimately may not prove to be anything like the right instrument for the job&mdash;in other words, a sledgehammer to crack a nut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are not saying that the government should abandon its attempts to get some improvement in this area. We are not saying that the current situation is satisfactory and that full cost reimbursement is a good system. I accept that it is not a sound system and I certainly understand why the government feels it has to do something to change it. But&mdash;and this is a criticism I have had of the minister responsible for this area for some time&mdash;this is yet another example of using a blanket approach to correct a problem. Basically people seem to be too lazy to actually get out there in the field, look at what is happening, look at things more closely and work out constructively what needs to be done. Although I do not agree with everything that the aged care industry is necessarily saying about these regulations, I really do think that they have raised sufficient cause for concern to say that the government has to examine again its approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share Senator Patterson's view that the most appropriate course of action is for the matter to be examined by Professor Gregory's current review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements. I do not want to get into an argument about whether or not the government did tell anybody or which minister told somebody that Professor Gregory would actually look at this matter, because I do not believe that is relevant. But I make the point very clearly that it seems completely ridiculous to have a major review of nursing home funding going on and not have it look at the funding of nursing home workers' compensation premiums as part of its work, specially when there is clearly so much dissatisfaction with what the government is proposing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious course of action is for the government to send the matter off to the Gregory review. It is due to report in April. I am happy to say to the government that if Professor Gregory comes back and says, `The government's got it right all along and this blanket approach is the way to go', the Democrats will be only too happy to look at it again. But at this point we believe waiting until April is not too much to ask when there is so much at stake. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not reverse the implementation of this decision, as it addresses a clear flaw in the previous funding arrangements. Until these changes, nursing homes were fully cost reimbursed for workers' compensation costs, regardless of the claiming and safety record of the home. This removed the incentives that the workers' compensation insurance authorities create by increasing premiums for employers who neglect their occupational health and safety obligations. The result of the old system is that nursing homes have a very poor safety record, evidenced by the fact that the base workers' compensation premium for nursing homes in Victoria is almost twice that for private hospitals, their nearest equivalent. It is interesting to note that both Senator Patterson and Senator Lees agree that there is considerable room for improvement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So does the industry. I must say that the arguments used by my colleagues, particularly Senator Patterson, were very unpersuasive. Senator Patterson said that there are people, for example, who suffer back injury in nursing homes and that this is an area that is being rorted in the nursing home industry. `Rorted' was her word; I wrote it down. She said that back injury was very hard to test. I think her words were that a good system could not get around these rorts any more than a bad system. With respect, it most certainly can. That is what she was saying. I think it is important that we stay on the point and not be distracted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot improve compensation practices by ignoring them or by leaving the current system in place. There can be no improvement by not looking at the question of micro-economic reform and building in incentives for nursing homes to improve. It is part of good management. I am sure that Senator Patterson, who is snorting over there, has some reason for doing it. To ask me to take account of the fact that back injury is easily rortable and is currently being rorted and that nothing would change that I think is a very unpersuasive argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Patterson again that at the moment nursing homes have a very poor safety record and the basic workers' compensation premium for nursing homes in Victoria is almost twice that of private hospitals, their nearest equivalent. Clearly, while some people in nursing homes have an opportunity to move around, we cannot exactly equate a nursing home with a private hospital. They are not without some considerable relevance, particularly if it involves back injury from lifting. It is interesting that private hospitals have a different record altogether. I do not think that point can be made strongly enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To overcome this situation and to improve conditions for staff and residents of nursing homes, the government decided in 1990 that, from 1993, workers' compensation costs would be funded in nursing homes on the basis of state average costs. Under the new funding arrangements, homes which have lower than average premiums are able to keep the difference between their funding and their actual costs. This provides a positive incentive for all nursing homes to improve their safety practices. Over 60 per cent of homes have lower than average costs and are gaining from the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some representatives of nursing homes claim that workers' compensation premiums are not dependent on management decisions or safety practices. However, many nursing homes are taking steps to improve safety practices in order to reduce premiums and to improve safety for their staff and residents. A church home in New South Wales achieved a 37 per cent reduction in premiums over three years as a result of its efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not see any reason to disadvantage a majority of homes with good safety records by reverting to the previous system. This measure provides an incentive for good practice and efficiency. It is entirely consistent with micro-economic reform initiatives aimed at improving efficiency and bringing down overall labour costs&mdash;in this case by making the working lives of nursing home staff safer. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of misunderstandings have clouded discussion of this change at various times. The costs funded will be the average cost in the nursing home industry, so the poorer than average starting point in the nursing home sector will not disadvantage the industry. The costs funded in each nursing home will also be calculated on costs in that state so that homes in states with higher premiums will not be disadvantaged. The average used will be a proportion of the payroll in each home so that the actual amount will vary with the size of the payroll of the home. Larger homes will not be disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The homes have had three years warning in recognition that premiums are calculated on an employer's claiming record ranging from one to three years previously. This should have provided sufficient time for homes to take steps to improve their claiming record. Early in the three-year lead time, a number of steps were taken to inform nursing homes of this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Costs of occupational health and safety training have been made an acceptable expense under nursing and personal care funding. I think that certainly counters the implication, at least, of some of Senator Patterson's comments. A number of projects to develop and implement such training have been funded under the aged care program. I appreciate that there is apprehension in some parts of the nursing home industry that there will still be accidents in nursing homes which will cause an unexpected jump in premiums above the average for their state. When instances have been examined by the department, however, these have not proven to be as drastic as feared by the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the state with the highest losses on the part of homes with poorer than average records the average loss is estimated to be around $28,000. By contrast, in the state with the lowest average loss for homes with poor records the average loss is under $5,000. This is offset, of course, by gains which would be made with homes with good records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of homes have suggested that they will sustain a large loss and will be unable to continue to operate under the new system. For this to happen the home would have to be a long way above the average cost as a result of a very large history of claims. There is no way of protecting employers from the consequences of such a history of poor management practice that does not involve penalising homes with good safety records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new funding arrangements correct a longstanding anomaly and provide an incentive structure which will improve safety for both the employees and the residents of nursing homes. So I again say that the government will not reverse its decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that both Senator Lees and Senator Patterson referred to Professor Gregory. Professor Gregory dealt with this issue in his published report which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Workers' Compensation costs were originally categorised in the same manner but in 1990 the Government decided that proprietors must be encouraged to try to provide a safe working environment for staff. Funding was therefore amended to pay nursing homes the average workers' compensation cost percentage of payroll for a State. This provides a significant incentive for proprietors because, if they can reduce their percentage of premium to payroll to less than the State average percentage for nursing homes, then they can retain the margin between their premium and the amount funded as profit. If they exceed the State average, they will be responsible for meeting the additional cost from what would otherwise have been their return on investment from within SAM.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we have what Professor Gregory might want to say. I understand that both Senator Lees and Senator Patterson were suggesting that this issue could have gone to Professor Gregory for review; well, we have Professor Gregory's view on this matter already on record. As I said, the government will not reverse the implementation of this decision so I am not persuaded by the arguments put here today. </PARA>

I will say this again very slowly so that the minister can understand what I said. Because there was widespread concern in the industry, I wrote to the industry in July to put up some alternatives.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion no. 396 standing in the name of Senator Coulter, relating to world population growth.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter is one of the most important matters ever to come before this parliament, that is, whether the idiosyncratic views of one senator alone should dictate the foreign policy of Australians specifically with respect to that part of our foreign aid program which is given to family planning and population limitation. If a deal was done between Senator Harradine and the government, it was particularly shabby, but I must say that I accept Senator Harradine's explanation that this was not a deal. In any case, there is the far more important issue, the substantive issue regarding the partial suspension of our aid for family planning and limitation of the frightening rate of population growth globally, and specifically in Third World countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that all senators who are here will support this motion for the suspension of standing orders and agree that there should be an immediate conscience vote on the substantive motion so that senators will have the opportunity to vote on this issue. In that way there would be a minimum loss of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The population issue is one half of the total environmental debate. The other half is the per capita impact. One can put together every aspect of environmental damage&mdash;whether it is local, continental or global, concerning the impact of greenhouse gases or the impact we are having on ozone depletion&mdash;and population is one half of that equation. To fail to recognise that is to fail to recognise that population is the most important issue which now faces humankind. We cannot afford to ignore the question of population, and specifically the rapid rate of population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World population is now increasing faster than at any time in human history. Every 11 years another one billion people are added to the world population. They demand more food, more shelter and more energy for their existence&mdash;indeed, a share of the ability to pollute and damage the environment, the atmosphere and the waters of the environment and to impact on the limited resources of planet earth. Limiting the rate of population growth reduces the rate at which the pressure of people on the planet increases; it provides a breathing space for attention to the per capita impacts of people on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the most important principles which underlie sustainable development are the precautionary principle and the principle of intergenerational equity. If we are in doubt about the ability of the earth to sustain seven billion, eight billion, 10 billion, 11 billion or 20 billion people, the precautionary principle says that we should slow down the rate of population growth until we are sure. We should not simply go on hell-bent on increasing the population. Intergenerational equity means that we would give to future generations the same access to resources that we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other main issue is the right of women to determine their own fertility practices. There are 125 million people in the world today who wish to use the services of family planning, who wish to space their families, who wish to limit the size of their families, and who are being denied that right by Senator Harradine and people like him who will not allow those people to make a choice. It is their right to make a choice determined by their moral codes and not to be dictated to by somebody in Australia. There is a clear link between mortality in children and mothers and family size. This is another issue of great importance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter probably has not given a great deal of consideration to the matters before the chamber at the moment, and the significant amount of government business and legislation that we have to deal with. Clearly,  at this stage, although there is no doubting the significance to all senators of the issues raised in Senator Coulter's notice of motion, it would be inappropriate, given that we have a number of opportunities in this chamber for these issues to be raised, for us to have a very extensive debate at this time on this particular motion. I do not know how much thought Senator Coulter has given to the difficulties that we have, but there are opportunities for honourable senators, apart from taking up time like this, to debate issues of substance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the substantive points that Senator Coulter has made, it has come to light recently that the original reports which related to the suspension of population activities were largely misleading. In fact, expenditure on population activities has not been halted, nor, for that matter, I think it is fair to say, has it been slowed down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantial increase in population related activities to a total of $30 million in 1993-94 and $130 million over the four years to 1996-97 was announced in the budget. The 1993-94 commitment of $30 million is a three-fold increase over the $10 million that was spent last year and nearly five times that which was spent in 1991-92. There is no doubt that the lack of family planning services in developing countries is an important, crucial and pressing human rights, development and environment issue; it is certainly also one that the Australian government is determined to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the announcement of the review that has been referred to, the $30 million set aside for expenditure in 1993-94 had been almost totally committed&mdash;all but $3.25 million&mdash;to specific projects and programs to assist population and family planning programs in developing countries. That expenditure of $26.75 million is now going ahead. Similarly, of the $130 million programmed to be spent over the next four years, $96 million has already been committed and will be unaffected by the suspension of the remaining part of the program. I think that represents a genuine honouring of commitments that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it is the case that the expenditure of $3.25 million this financial year and a further $30.75 million over the following three financial years has been put on hold pending a fully independent review conducted by experts and development economists. I believe that that is a reasonably rational way for us to go. It will mean that these matters will be looked at on a sound intellectual basis and the inquiry will be completed by March,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise at short notice to support Senator Harradine on this matter. Senator Coulter accused Senator Harradine of being the only senator in this place to hold the views on birth control that he does; I can assure Senator Coulter that Senator Harradine is not the only senator in this place to hold those views.

But I am concerned that the government was going to increase funding rapidly&mdash;and this morning Senator Faulkner outlined the amounts over the next few years&mdash;at the expense of what I would call practical aid to developing countries which would be of far more benefit to those particular countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why Senator Coulter has to bring this matter before this parliament with such haste with only a few weeks left before Christmas in which to discuss a big agenda of very demanding matters. I know this question is a very serious one. It one that I, and I know a lot of my colleagues, would like a lot more time to prepare for, for there to be a proper and full debate. I object to this being brought forward this morning in this way, as I am sure most of my colleagues would too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard these sorts of comments about the population increasing before. I remember in my farming days being told that, if I hung around farming long enough, the year 1984 would bring the biggest world shortage of food that had ever been seen, and that every farmer would be very prosperous because we would be working flat out producing food for the starving millions of the world. It is now 1993 and I am in this place, not on the farm, and that boom in the production of food never arrived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remember very well the dire warnings. We can all remember the starving millions in India&mdash;and I am not saying that there are not still starving millions of people in India&mdash;but Australia itself was providing very practical aid to India and helping India to produce enough food to feed its millions of people. In fact, we find now that India is a net exporter of wheat, and it is not that long ago that we were providing massive aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Practical aid to all these disadvantaged and so-called overpopulated countries is the way to go. In my opinion, to try at short notice to take freedom of choice from parents in these countries is not the way to go. People should still have the God-given right to have children that they can look after; not to spend money on the sorts of things that have been happening, which Senator Harradine has brought out in estimates over the years, such as the abuse of females with all these untried and unknown drugs. Even now, we find questions being raised about ultrasound equipment which has been used in our own country. Women themselves are starting to realise that a lot of these so-called birth control measures that we are funding are very deleterious to their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter's efforts to pull this stunt this morning&mdash;bringing on a notice of motion and then trying to get it debated, without giving anybody any prior advice&mdash;is not the way to go. I repeat that Senator Harradine's views on birth control are not just his; I know they are the views of many others in this place. In fact, in this place we have a parliamentary pro life group, of which Senator Harradine is the chairman, that does not share the views of Senator Coulter. That is our right and privilege in representing the people of our states. I know that thousands and thousands of my constituents share the views of Senator Harradine and me on this matter. Therefore, I certainly will be voting against any move by Senator Coulter to discuss this matter this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Calvert made a fine speech. He said that Senator Coulter was trying to pull a stunt by bringing this matter on. I doubt that this was the case. I think Senator Coulter has shown again and again in this place that he has a commitment to environmental issues, to the sort of world we live in and to the future of that world. No doubt in the interests of affording a better life, a better environment and a better situation for everyone in the world, he wanted to bring this matter on this morning as a matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate now taking place is about whether this matter should be brought on. I think, clearly from the debate that has taken place so far, it should not. Senator Coulter took Senator Harradine to task.

What he is saying, though, as I understand him, is that the issues of life and life-giving mechanisms are very serious matters which should not be looked at and dealt with on the basis of particular ideologies or slogans; that they should be looked at in terms of the reality, which we all must face at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Calvert, in supporting the position that Senator Harradine might take if this were a full-scale debate, pointed out some very pertinent points that I would certainly like to consider.

I would also like to consider what Senator Harradine and Senator Calvert have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter said that he hoped that senators would vote not on party lines but according to their conscience.

Senator Faulkner, in his address to the chamber, bore out the feeling that these are very serious and weighty matters and that we need to have an extended debate in this chamber at some time. The debate should be based on evidence. There should be a true discussion about the proper principles that ought to arise from these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of that debate a conclusion should be reached which deals with this very difficult problem about the way the environment is to be treated in the future and any relationship that that issue has to the increase in population. I am not saying that these things are not happening. But I think, on what I have heard so far, it would certainly be too simple a proposition to say that the sorts of disasters that Senator Coulter speaks of will necessarily follow an increase in population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Senator Harradine will speak in this debate. I think his position is often misrepresented in this chamber and elsewhere. Although I agree with Senator Coulter's general thrust that there ought to be a debate about these great issues, that debate should take place at some time other than, as it were, on the run this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be supporting the suspension of standing orders to enable this motion to be debated this morning. I think what has been said so far indicates pretty clearly that there is a great deal in the motion to be discussed and it ought to be done at a proper time. I know that a lot of my colleagues would want to participate in a debate on this topic. Several points of view could be expressed on the motion. I think that a lot of people&mdash;I am not a cynic myself&mdash;are very curious, indeed, as to how the suspension of the program came about at the time that it did.

If Senator Coulter had been intending to bring it on this morning, one would have expected him yesterday, at the placing of business, to have sought to adjourn the motion until today. That would have alerted everybody as to what would be happening.

At the moment we are pressured by the government's program, which is clearly disorganised and running late. That has to be dealt with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the four minutes that are left to me I wish to make a couple of points. I thank the honourable senators who have indicated their views about the suspension today. I note what Senator Reid has just said: there is a need for a clear, detailed, informed, sane and rational debate about this matter and this is not the time for it. It really is a stunt to try to pull it on now&mdash;to debate the suspension of standing orders now for half an hour in order to try to get the motion up without debate. That is a nonsense. We need to have a thorough going debate about this matter. I would welcome that debate here or in any other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that exists at present is that that debate is being stifled. The population controllers assert falsely that there are too many people in the world, particularly too many people in the Third World&mdash;black, yellow and brown people. In fact, they blame the fertility of poor women in poor countries for a whole range of problems&mdash;famine, war and economic stagnation which, eventually, boil down to man's inhumanity to man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this suggestion is promoted by the United Nations Population Fund and the IPPF. The United Nations Population Fund praised China for its program of force, coercion and abortions. What did that do to the women of that country? Was Senator Coulter condemning that? No. UNFPA put a medal around the neck of the Chinese leader for that particular program. UNFPA is also involved in coercive practices in Indonesia. Is Senator Coulter criticising those matters which are impacting heavily on women in those countries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pouring money into Bangladesh for population control. Did anyone hear what feminist Dr Farida Akhter, from the development organisation, UBINIG, in Bangladesh, said at a recent ministerial seminar? She appealed to the Australian government. She said, `If you are giving any money at all, don't give it to the population controllers. We don't have money for health programs. Divert it to health programs'. This year we have the worst ODA to GNP ratio in our aid budget for over 20 years, except for one year. From that small budget, increased funding is being allocated to this sort of population control area. That funding will be taken away from normal development assistance areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">'Burn the books' is the attitude of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, IPPF, when somebody criticises it. For example, when Stephen Trombley wrote a very interesting book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Right to Reproduce</EMPHASIS>, which showed the links involved and the money that goes from pharmaceutical companies to the International Planned Parenthood Federation, what did the International Planned Parenthood Federation do? It banned it. It burnt it. It got an injunction from the courts to get it banned. This is a banned book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 April 1989, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lancet</EMPHASIS> criticised the fact that the book had been withdrawn in the face of threatened libel action by the International Planned Parenthood Federation. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IPPF objected to references to funding by large US corporations and to critical remarks about the nature of their large-scale antifertility activities, especially in the Third World. Policies concerning population control are always controversial, and the enforced withdrawal of this book reduces much-needed discussion of the issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what population control is about. It does not want the truth. The truth is that this is not about family planning; this is about population control. This is about target driven programs which are coercive. Let us listen to what the women of the Third World are saying at the present moment. They need justice and they need a fair go. We are gobbling up the resources and they are not. </PARA>

Even though the minister has assured us that the inquiry can, we hope, expand our understanding of the population and development issues, and in fact lead to a more effective program, I think it sends the wrong signals around the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee has before it the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993. This is an important part of the higher prudential standards to be applied to superannuation in this country. It is important because many of the traditional ways of handling disputes such as through the court system are expensive and lengthy. Most members do not have either the resources or the confidence in their ability to tackle trustees in circumstances where they believe they have been unfairly treated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, there is before the committee, on behalf of the Liberal-National coalition, an amendment in respect of the complaints tribunal. The tribunal cannot deal with a complaint about a trustee's decision if it is about a benefit that was paid before the commencement of the act and&mdash;it is this `and' that is so important and which I think a lot of people have lost sight of&mdash;if the benefit was paid in whole or in part to a person other than the complainant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is in two parts and is very restrictive, far more restrictive than the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. For example, it does not stop the lodgment of all complaints before the commencement date of 1 July 1994, only those where it was paid in whole or in part to a person other than the complainant. Therefore, I would submit that well over 90 per cent&mdash;perhaps 95 per cent&mdash;of the expected cases which are likely to come before the tribunal would be affected by the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's intention to reject this amendment would cause suffering in an area where, most probably, those people have greatest need for the cash resources and the cash payment that would flow from the trustee's decision. The issue is the consequence that will flow if the government and any other parties reject this amendment. The consequences of rejection of our amendment would be that the trustees would automatically delay payment in necessitous circumstances where there is the probability or the possibility of dispute because it would give rise to a double jeopardy position. The delay could well be for between six and nine months because we know that there will be a string of cases before the tribunal after 1 July because cases before 1 July 1994 in respect of problems can be heard by the tribunal after 1 July. Given the resources of the tribunal, one could well find that people would be denied an otherwise legitimate payment for up to 12 months in most necessitous circumstances. I think this is quite unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a trustee could not run the risk in circumstances where money was paid out in good faith to a named beneficiary such as a widow. The money is paid out to the widow and subsequently, six or eight months down the track, along comes the de facto and says, `Well, this was unfair. I have been living with this chap for 24 years. I am the true beneficiary'. The tribunal would then make up its mind and say, `In the interests of natural justice&mdash;the other lady has moved off, is unknown, is perhaps living in another state&mdash;we will declare that the moneys should be paid to the de facto lady because she had been living with the deceased for a good number of years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such circumstances, what hope would the trustees have of getting that money back, paid in good faith to the widow? It would create a double jeopardy position for the trustees. Particularly in small funds, it could severely embarrass the cash position of the fund and place in jeopardy the interests of the remaining members of the fund. I am sure that that is not what would be required. Therefore, I ask the government to reconsider its position. It is a small amendment. It will not affect a lot of people. The point is the consequences that will flow from the refusal of the trustees to pay out if there is any doubt at all about their decision being upset subsequently by the tribunal. They are not given the time delay because of cases being stacked up.</PARA>

Obviously the tribunal process, which we recommend, is a very inexpensive method and it is a good invention. But I think we have to be very careful that we do not disadvantage people in circumstances where they could be denied a legitimate payment, simply because trustees will be warned, wherever there is a doubt, not to pay because such payment could be overridden subsequently by the tribunal. That is the greater problem. Then there is the associated problem that these people, who will be in necessitous circumstances, will be denied access to this money. I ask the government, through Senator Sherry, a very capable former chairman of that committee, to reconsider its position. </PARA>

Unfortunately, despite our alleged capabilities, we do not seem to be able to see eye to eye on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central thrust of Senator Watson's argument is that some people&mdash;I accept this&mdash;may experience a time delay of nine to 12 months in receiving their payment. But the cure which he is proposing is wrong in principle. The opposition is saying that, in order to minimise that problem, we should deny people altogether the right to appear before the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clash of two principles here. The opposition happens to believe that the consequence of the outcome that it has outlined is worse than the principle that the government strongly supports, which is that people should have the right to appear before the tribunal and to argue their case. In some cases, there may be some delay of payment, but at least they will have the right to argue before the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson said that the issue involves only a few people. It is not a few people. Death disputes occur every day. Hundreds of people would have their right to appear before the tribunal cut off. We just cannot agree to that in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson then said that there is an alternative for these people in that they can go to the courts. But how many people have been doing that, and is it a practical option? For example, very few people have gone to the courts with cases dealing with death benefits. In fact, the figures I have seen suggest that it is fewer than 100. People simply cannot succeed there; it is too expensive and it takes too long. So the alternative that Senator Watson is suggesting is also inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two principles are at stake. I accept that Senator Watson is very concerned that there would be a delay in payment&mdash;not the abrogation of a payment. I accept that that is probable for some people. But our principal concern, which we argue outweighs Senator Watson's principle, is that we will be cutting off altogether the access of hundreds of people to the tribunal. We argue that, on balance, and having regard to our principle and the numbers of people that would be affected, our argument is stronger. Therefore, we see the amendment that Senator Watson is suggesting as the wrong solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I think this problem is probably insoluble because of the phase-in time needed for the operation of the tribunal. There will always be people affected by a cut-off date. But Senator Watson's proposed solution is, in its outcomes, much worse. Frankly, what would the Senate committee say to people who have complained to it over the last year or two about being disadvantaged and who come back to it and ask, `Why did you cut off our right to appear before the tribunal'?  Whilst the principle that Senator Watson has enunciated has validity, it is outweighed by the approach and the principle that we are adopting in opposing this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to Senator Harradine's question. The volume of complaints involving death benefits and superannuation is small compared to the total volume of complaints. Evidence given before the committee certainly suggests that it is small. I cannot give Senator Harradine figures on it, but we do know that it tends to be a fairly small area, albeit an important one because people are waiting for money from the resolution of their death benefit case. At present, trustees have an absolute power to determine these issues. There is the common law, but, as I mentioned, it is frankly inaccessible for the member of a fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From past experience, we believe that the proportion of this type of complaint compared to the total volume of complaints to the tribunal is quite small. Therefore, we believe that the likely time of resolution for a death benefit dispute will be six to nine months. That is a delay, but it is not an unreasonable period in which to consider the outcome and adjudicate on a death benefit dispute. So there would be some delay, but it is not significant in terms of time and the volume of the tribunal's work. The tribunal could well decide to give those issues priority because of the urgent nature of a death benefit case and the need to pay the beneficiary. Those problems can be overcome. </PARA>

Frankly, is it worth people going through the courts of law arguing common law&mdash;and in many cases, I suspect, trying to break new ground&mdash;when the legal fee that they will have to pay to recover what could be a significant sum of money to them will take a significant bite out of the moneys that they may receive from the trustees on a death benefit?</PARA></TALK.START>

I cannot imagine that there will be hundreds of these situations, but there will be some.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very complexity of the SIS bills that we have been debating demonstrates that consumers will need assistance with their complaints. While we should acknowledge that the government intends to resource the tribunal and to have a reasonably substantial secretariat, we should not lose sight of the fact that independent legal advice is a very important principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to compare the access of consumers in other areas, we would find that in the last six months of 1992 the two main consumer legal centres in Sydney and Melbourne finalised four major litigation cases, took on 205 smaller cases, made 130 court appearances, gave 2000 telephone advices, negotiated credit policy changes during four licence renewals, distributed 967 how to manuals and produced dozens of media articles and stories. Cases currently being finalised by the centres will deliver consumers more than $5 million in damages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with the best will in the world, I do not believe the secretariat can match that sort of outcome. That is why I think it is important to resource the tribunal, in the first instance, independently and to move towards the Senate committee's recommendation of a government and industry cooperative model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the centres will fill the void that exists at the moment of representing consumer interests in the superannuation industry. The funds are well represented by ASFA and the government is well represented by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is not true that consumers are adequately and proportionately well funded as well. I do not think it is fair to leave it to fall on individuals or overworked trade unions through the industry funds. I think it is important that the advice be independent and that it be consumer orientated. Honourable senators would not be surprised to know that the proposal is strongly supported by AFCO and the Australian Consumers Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point to make is that the amendment does not compel the government to set up the centres, but it will show that the Senate strongly supports the Senate select committee's recommendation if this amendment is passed. If the government refuses to issue the regulations then, under this amendment, reasons must be provided to both houses of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consumer movement estimates that the cost of setting up two specialist legal centres is about $400,000. The cost of linking these centres through liaison officers in the four other states, in already established legal services, would add another $260,000, making a total of $660,000. I think that is a reasonably small investment in the short term, because the sunset clause is in there, to ensure that the rights the parliament is setting up with the SIS bills today are truly enforced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Senate that the amendment moved by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Australian Democrats is far different from what was originally proposed. In its current form, it is certainly much more acceptable. It is certainly very much in line with the thrust of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation's recommendations in providing a greater focus for consumers in the superannuation area, and that is what we applaud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume Senator Kernot is talking about amendment 3, clause 16. We do not intend to support amendments 1 or 2. Amendment 3 will have the support of the Liberal-National party coalition because the requirements that Senator Kernot is seeking are not dissimilar to those in clauses 24 and 25 of the complaints bill as it stands. Clause 24 deals with the lodging of the requisite material documents with the tribunal while clause 25 deals with the power to obtain information and documentation. We interpret Senator Kernot's amendment 3 as requiring the provision of similar documentation, on request, by the particular legal services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can foresee certain situations where certain trustees may say that there is no legislative authority for this information to be passed to such a tribunal, even though the request has been documented by the potential complainant. Therefore, we believe it is necessary to have such access as a service assisting the complainant to prepare the case before the tribunal. It is important that the lawyers at these legal centres do not appear as a witness or as an advocate before the tribunal. They assist the complainant to prepare the case. We are attempting to provide a low cost service to the consumers. I believe that through this amendment Senator Kernot, on behalf of the Democrats, has provided the means of facilitating that flow of information. It is nothing more and nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of funding. If paragraph (c) is not supported, we could have a farcical situation because there has to be some inducement for the government to take the amendment seriously. This bill is not appropriating money for setting up the legal service centres. I believe that these centres can be a very cost-effective way of assisting people. At the end of the day they may be less expensive than adding additional resources to the secretariat of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Therefore, all the government has to do is examine the issue. If it will not proceed to fund in the next budget, it should come back to the parliament and explain why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see anything wrong with the situation in a democratic sense. We have a recommendation from a parliamentary committee. It will look at the question of funding and it will come back and explain its reasons, particularly in circumstances where it will not accede to that request. What is the problem? The Senate is not appropriating money; we are just asking the government, if it has problems with the funding of it, to come back and explain the problem to the parliament in an open way and say why it feels there is a difficulty in complying, or complying adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a responsible Senate; we will not throw money away. We have been told that these centres will initially cost over half a million dollars. In line with the Senate committee's recommendations relating to funding through appropriation, we said that it should be capped for three years and other alternative funding could then be looked at. Following negotiations with Senator Kernot, she was prepared to put a three-year ceiling on that. We thank her for that. Without that, we would not be able to provide our support because it would have been open-ended. I think there are adequate safeguards on all sides. Therefore, the amendment will have the support of the National-Liberal party coalition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With that indication, the argument might be futile in terms of its outcome, but I will put it nevertheless. In listening to the argument about the creation of independent legal centres, it strikes me as something of an irony that both the opposition and the Democrats are proposing to channel complaints through lawyers when we are seeking a low cost outcome. The thrust of the tribunal approach is to avoid a legalistic approach and to consider issues in a manner somewhat like an industrial tribunal would. In many jurisdictions lawyers are forbidden and therefore they are generally not used and we have the development of a range of advocates and advice deliverers who generally provide their services&mdash;from all the evidence&mdash;at a lower cost than lawyers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a little ironic that both Senator Kernot and Senator Watson are suggesting, through this amendment, that we put aside government moneys to fund legal centres.

But the fact is that lawyers encourage lawyers. I have seen it happen. I am not saying that the legal centres themselves do this. But, as soon as a consumer starts employing lawyers, the other party will run off and get a QC. I have seen it happen in the industrial systems, where lawyers are permitted. I have great reservations about the involvement of lawyers. But that is not the main reason why we oppose the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot said that consumers need assistance. They do. That is why we are setting up the tribunal.

There will be other part-time tribunal members. There will be a full-time secretariat of 18 people and three-quarters of a million dollars will be allocated per annum. That is in the bill.

I would say to Senator Sherry that the government could well find itself saving a considerable amount of money because the resources required within the ISC secretariat to assist consumers will be so much less if consumers have an alternative, cheaply funded body to go to other than the ISC.

<PARA>I point out that where trustees are other than members of a fund&mdash;they could be representatives of the ACTU&mdash;this amendment is no reflection on their capabilities. Some of the best performing funds in Australia are those that are run on the basis of trade union-type representatives representing employees. There is no doubt about that, and that is widely recognised. However, as these bills are all about prudential standards, we believe that there is no better auditor of a superannuation fund than a person who is a member of that fund. We are suggesting that at least one member who represents the employees' interests shall be a member of that superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that honourable members will find that in most circumstances that is the case. It makes good sense that there is at least one trustee who is a member, and maybe more. This does not preclude an employee who is a member of the fund from being a trade unionist. These bills are all about safeguards and prudential controls. It should not be forgotten that there are very high standards required of trustees. They can be sued by other members of the fund who believe the trustees have not acted in their best interests. There could be circumstances where the trustees make a decision that does not suit the performance of the fund and that could cause difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments provide that at least one of the trustees representing the employees' interests shall be a member of the fund, rather than an outside person. I think this will enhance the prudential standards and controls that operate. The amendment is moved with the highest motive in terms of trying to add another notch or ratchet to the prudential standards or controls that apply to superannuation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Watson was very careful not to answer Senator Kernot's question about the effect on current funds. The government opposes these amendments, one reason being the query that Senator Kernot made of Senator Watson. It would require the resignation of a number of trustees from a number of funds. We do not know the number, but I certainly know there are some funds that do not have a person who is a member of the fund as a trustee.

It may well be difficult to get a member who is an employee in the industry to sit as a trustee.

The water surrounding Hindmarsh Island, which is located at the mouth of the Murray River, was listed by Australia as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar convention of 1985.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to the proponents' environmental impact statement in 1990, public concerns were raised about, amongst other things, the lack of infrastructure for managing increased visitation to the island's valuable wetlands. In October 1993, the environment, resource and development committee of the parliament of South Australia released its inquiry into the Hindmarsh Island bridge project. Amongst its recommendations were that the South Australian government should reassess the need for a bridge and that more emphasis should be placed on the environmental aspects of the proposal. Senator Coulter has already alluded to that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is that there are no aspects of the bridge proposal with a potential to trigger Commonwealth environmental assessment legislation.

Subject to any decision by the South Australian government, the federal and state governments will cooperate in this approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Immigration and ethnic affairs is an area of great sensitivity and complexity. I believe that it needs to be addressed responsibly and with care and thoughtfulness. Unfortunately, in the last 24 hours in the New South Wales parliament we have had an example of the completely opposite approach to a very sensitive issue. That occurred in an outburst from the New South Wales Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Photios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Photios was addressing the question of the boat people. I believe that his comments can be most generously described as inaccurate, indulgent and irresponsible. Fundamentally, Mr Photios's comments were peppered with outrageous inaccuracies. He claimed that the conditions in the Villawood detention centre could best be described as appalling. The government has been more than forthcoming in respect of the conditions in detention facilities. Our submission to the joint standing committee inquiry into detention demonstrates this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that Mr Photios did not bother to address the issue accurately. If he had done so, perhaps he would not have stated that only limited health services, and virtually no women's health care, were available at Villawood. The fact is that a centre nurse is on duty six days a week and a doctor visits the centre twice a day. Basic dental and optical care are provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the New South Wales minister even checked with his colleagues, he would have discovered that the New South Wales Department of Health's child-care service visits Villawood regularly to provide antenatal services to mothers. Since July this year a gender specific medical program has been operating&mdash;a program which now formalises a previously informal arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, and contrary to Mr Photios's claims, the centre provides educational facilities, including English language classes, to all detainees&mdash;children and adults. It is grossly untrue to suggest that the children have been denied education. It is also grossly untrue to suggest that detainees' access to religious services is limited. Religious workers from the major Christian denominations attend the centre on a daily basis and Buddhist monks usually attend the centre on culturally significant days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most outrageous part of Mr Photios's statement yesterday was that counselling for victims of torture and rape is virtually non-existent. This is not only grossly wrong but also it illustrates Mr Photios's preparedness to exploit the most vulnerable of these people for his own political ends. A full range of torture and trauma counselling and treatment is available to the detainees. That range includes the admirable work of a group of psychiatrists led by Dr Maria Bashir and the service for the treatment and rehabilitation of torture and trauma survivors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Photios did not stop at just spreading inaccuracies. In his typically opportunistic fashion, he accused the Labor Party of being anti-migrant. This comes from a member of a party which says that probably all immigrant applicants, including boat people, should be removed from the jurisdiction of the ADJR. As a consequence, the access to the courts&mdash;which the constitution guarantees them&mdash;would be denied to them. Mr Photios's confusion went even further in a pretty broad statement that he made in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His statements are irresponsible. They do not add to the constructive nature of the debate as is necessary in this area.

There are 170,000 Australians employed in that industry which has an annual turnover of $30 billion a year. We estimate that by the year 2000 our processed food exports will total about $7 billion. Already value added food exports exceed imports, $3 billion to $2.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At ANUGA it was interesting to see the presentations that various countries had. Australia was represented by a presentation on which we spent $350,000. By comparison, New Zealand spent $1.7 million on its trade exhibit at the fair. The amount of money spent was reflected in the size and style of the exhibits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate those Australian private firms which were at the fair and committed resources in conjunction with Austrade. One of the most disappointing things was to see the impact that present European Community policy on meat quotas has on Australian industry. The Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation had a separate stand with several private exhibiters. In one morning every one of those exhibiters said that they had to turn down orders from Europe for their products because they could not get access to the European market because of the quota system. All the European buyers said the quality and presentation of our meat was absolutely first rate and that they would be only too delighted to buy it but, unfortunately, as we know, the European Community has quota limits and we cannot get into those markets because of those quotas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect that was positive was that this was not just a European fair; it was a world fair. Although we were stymied on sales to the European Community, the livestock corporation and its exhibiters got very good business from customers in the Middle East.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is aware of the concerns regarding this matter. We are examining the implications of the recent court decision concerning the application of FBT in this area. So it is under examination. There are some points that I think we should make in case this generates unnecessary fear and concern amongst people and perhaps leads to unnecessary changes in practices. It is important to note that there is already an exemption from FBT where an employer pays taxi fares for an employee on an infrequent and irregular basis; that is, where the employee is unexpectedly required to work late. So circumstances in which it would not have been possible for people to make other arrangements because they did not have advance notice are already exempt from FBT.

Of course, FBT does not apply in the case of FBT-exempt employers. Many areas of large volume female employment in the shift area would come into that category. There are a number of circumstances in which, even if the most extreme interpretation of the National Australia Bank decision were to be taken, exemption would apply.

The board, management and staff at ADI are to be congratulated on their progress and success in recent years. The company is aware that the government will consider the future of ADI in the new year and whether it will be retained as a government-owned enterprise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the tariff reduction covers carded wool, wool tops and other combed wool. This breakthrough is the outcome of the Prime Minister's wool initiative taken during his visit to China in June and raised in bilateral discussions that Senator Cook and my colleague Mr Crean held with the Chinese Minister for Trade and Economic Cooperation, Madam Wu Yi, in October.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Collins said that the BASI reports raised a number of serious issues/questions he felt should be answered by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>That is absolutely correct. The sequence of events is as follows: on Monday morning&mdash;that is, 27 October&mdash;I had a meeting with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and I was advised, apart from a whole range of other issues in terms of assertions and unsubstantiated rumours that it was pursuing, that the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation had just received a report&mdash;Senator Macdonald should listen to this&mdash;that a CAA officer may have been aware of the `implications of removing the autopilot', not removing it, which is a substantially different thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell Senator Macdonald why that is important&mdash;and I may need the additional two minutes to do this because it is vitally important. Only about 20 per cent of the autopilots that are fitted to this kind of aircraft disable other instruments when they are removed. About 80 per cent of the aircraft of this type that fly in Australia can have the autopilots removed without affecting any other instrument in the aircraft; in other words, a more expensive form of autopilot. That is, in general terms, the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was a question of whether the CAA knew what the implications would be of removing that autopilot, not whether it was actually removed. It is vitally important when these matters are discussed that we deal with facts, not assertions, because this matter will be subjected to a coronial inquiry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), to a question without notice asked by Senator West this day, relating to refugees and access to the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the quite scurrilous attack that was made on the New South Wales Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Michael Photios, in Senator Bolkus's answer. Mr Photios will, no doubt, answer the quite scurrilous diatribe, point by point, as soon as he has the opportunity to read what the minister said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say three things. Firstly, I know from a very close personal observation of Michael Photios since his appointment as New South Wales minister for ethnic affairs earlier this year that he is widely respected by ethnic communities throughout New South Wales and, I must say, also in states beyond his own state of New South Wales. In my view, in the short time that he has been there he has been quite an outstanding minister&mdash;and recognised as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, to assert that Mr Photios&mdash;who I understand is of Greek background&mdash;is in some way anti-migration, or anti-immigration, as Senator Bolkus said, is as absurd and ridiculous as it is scurrilous and wrong. Thirdly, to assert, as Senator Bolkus did, that there should be reduced access to Australian courts beyond that which is currently available for appeals against adverse decisions on applications for entry through Australia's existing carefully constituted and independent system of administrative review is also both nonsensical and scurrilous. The minister must know that under the constitution all persons are guaranteed access to our legal system through, at the very least, the High Court. There is no question about that and there never has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that one of the very important elements of Australia's migration program is currently under threat because of the heavy demands on the Federal Court flowing from appeals against migration determinations. Last year, no less than 61 per cent of all ADJR cases before the Federal Court were migration cases. That puts great pressure on the court and it also endangers the integrity of our migration program. If Senator Bolkus was implying, as he appeared to, that, contrary to what I and others have said, there should be no examination of this situation and that to have any examination of this is somehow anti-immigration, that is indeed to fly in the face of reality and quite contrary to the true interests of our migration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, without having a firm and final view on the matter, that an examination of this matter is necessary for the fundamental reason of wishing to maintain and strengthen our migration program and its integrity. If Senator Bolkus is suggesting that to have an examination of this matter is in any way a problem for the migration program and an undermining of it, then I believe he stands condemned out of his own mouth for dereliction of his ministerial duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I say to Senator Bolkus&mdash;I am glad he has remained in the chamber&mdash;that he has made pleas over time, and I well understand them, for as bipartisan an approach as possible between the parties in this parliament, and I presume in the Australian community, to the question of our migration program. If Senator Bolkus thinks that by the scurrilous type of attack he made today on Michael Photios he is in any way enhancing the cause of a bipartisan approach, then I am afraid he is very sadly misguided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Short for raising this particular matter at this stage. I do not know that his accusing me of being scurrilous in his diatribe helped the situation, but I do make the point at the outset that the criticisms I make of Mr Photios are based on the statements he made in the New South Wales parliament. One by one I went through most of those statements&mdash;there are others that I could go through&mdash;to indicate how wrong he is and to indicate that he is using this particular situation for base political purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that criticism and in doing so I make the point that Senator Short has been in a position in this place to have made those criticisms if he so wanted, but he has not. He has had the good sense not to. He has been able to sit on committees here, scrutinise the evidence and come to a position which has drawn him from making the sorts of criticisms that were made yesterday by Mr Photios. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a major distinction between the way the opposition in this place has handled the issue and the way the New South Wales minister has handled it. I think it sheds positive light on the opposition in this place that it has not stooped to the sorts of criticisms and inaccuracies that were the basis of the statement in the New South Wales parliament. I say that quite sincerely and recognising that this is an issue which is not easy and recognising that the opposition sees it as not being easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to appeal or judicial review, Senator Short in an estimates committee last week indicated that one way through it would be to remove the Migration Act from the jurisdiction of the ADJR. If he is still thinking through that position, then that is good and he should keep thinking through it. It is a position that we on this side have also looked at, both in the context of drafting legislation and also in the context of the current inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have come to a very strong position that it is not an appropriate thing to do, at least for the whole of the Migration Act as Senator Short indicated on Friday. It was never considered for the whole of the Migration Act, but in respect of these cases what we would be doing by embarking upon this alternative course which has been mooted is basically taking the long way to get to the same situation we have now. Senator Short is right; there is the original jurisdiction of the High Court which, on the best advice I have available to me, would ensure that people in this category coming into Australia would be able to access, indirectly through the High Court, Federal Court consideration of their cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short should go ahead and consider it. I think it is healthy for him to do it. We would not consider it in respect of the whole of the migration intake, and that is what he would be doing by embracing the whole operation of the Migration Act in the way that he is mooting. Even if he were to consider it for this limited group of cases, he would find the same constitutional, mechanical problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make is that it is a difficult situation. I have had one opportunity to discuss this situation at length with Mr Photios. In doing so, he acknowledged the difficulty. In fact, this is probably what gets under my skin more than anything else: there is no care and no responsibility shown by a state minister who has no responsibility for this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I took him through it, he appreciated and acknowledged that these issues were hard ones. He said that he understood the federal government's decision and situation, but he then went on quite candidly to say that that would not stop him from bagging us. He can bag us if he will, but he should not feed off a situation which, by this sort of misinformed bagging, perpetuates the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all Australians would like to see an outcome to this. Our special assistance category program is geared not only to those in detention but also to other Cambodians with families in Cambodia, families in compassionate circumstances. It is a valuable program. People should not go out, on the basis of misinformation, criticising a program which has benefits not just for boat people but also for others.

<PARA>This report shows how much has been achieved by the Resource Assessment Commission. The Resource Assessment Commission has existed for 4 1/2 years and during that time has completed major investigations into the Kakadu Conservation Zone, our forests and timber resources. The current inquiry into the management and use of resources in Australia's coastal zone is due to be completed by the end of this month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced in the context of the last budget that the Resource Assessment Commission would cease operations from the end of this year. This is very disappointing given the work that the Resource Assessment Commission has done, and it is incredibly short-sighted. The Resource Assessment Commission brought a refreshingly independent approach to major resource issues. Its research has been scientific, without ignoring the social aspects and values of our community. It has been given issues that the federal government has not wanted to deal with, which meant that it was never going to have an easy time. Considering this, it has done remarkably well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultation that the Resource Assessment Commission undertook for the coastal zone inquiry was impressive and hopefully will have effects that last beyond the actual report that is produced. The Greens (WA) regard implementation of this report as an indication of the government's commitment to protecting our precious and fragile coastal system. The Resource Assessment Commission undertook some pathbreaking research&mdash;for example, the contingent valuation survey of the Kakadu Conservation Zone, the analysis of the pricing of Australian woodchip exports and investigations into the use of mediation in the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of using mediation is particularly important and should be encouraged to a much greater extent. In the United States, mediation has been very successful in helping to resolve major environmental disputes. Mediation can work better than unilateral government action because it brings opposing sides together to discuss their different values, problems and proposed solutions. The results can last longer because a framework for constructive consultation is established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have never agreed with all the recommendations of the Resource Assessment Commission, but we recognise that Resource Assessment Commission reports have invariably moved forward the debate on the real environmental issues. The government is trying to kill the messenger, which has suggested to it in the nicest possible manner that the environment is important and needs greater protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dispute the contention by the government that it has integrated consideration of economic and environmental priorities and so removed the need for a body like the Resource Assessment Commission. The example of what is happening in the old growth forests of New South Wales illustrates how the chop-it-down mentality, with the Commonwealth not doing anything, remains. The government has suggested that CEPA, the Industry Commission or ASTEC could undertake such inquiries. However, they are not regarded as independent and do not have the specific research expertise required to cover both environmental and developmental aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to reconsider its decision to close down the operations of the Resource Assessment Commission, which was made in a very underhand manner and without consultation with environmental groups.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a group of reports from the Australian Research Council evaluation program. One of the surprising things about these four reports is that they are dated 1990 or 1991 as the period of review. It surprises me that a department like DEET that has 17,000 staff cannot really get its act together a little faster to make sure that we have these reports on time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably one of the most surprising things in these reports that I have ever read in any report is a disclaimer contained in their background sections. The reports were compiled by very distinguished groups of professors reviewing fields such as economics, organic chemistry, material and chemical engineering and fluid mechanics. The bottom of the first page on the report on economics states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Robert Trevor wishes it recorded that he did not agree to the partitioning of the report into public and confidential sections. Professor Trevor notes that this was not the original intention, and that, if it had been, the Panel may well have produced a different report.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Trevor's comments are really, in effect, a disclaimer and carry a shadow over the report. This, combined with the timing of the report, is most inadequate on behalf of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other things are inadequate in the handling of research in this country. I want to focus on one of these today in the light of an article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by Professor Roger Holmes, who is the deputy vice-chancellor of research at Griffith University. Professor Holmes's article, which is headed `Beazley must rethink funding formula', highlights one of the very unfortunate consequences of the 1993 budget and its effect on research infrastructure funding. He describes the budget as a wolf in sheep's clothing which will result in the further concentration of research dollars in this country in a smaller group of universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the Senate has heard of the plan of seven universities in this country to have the research dollars concentrated in their hands. What people have to realise is that two-thirds of the research money is already concentrated in these universities and what is now being proposed by these universities, aided and abetted by this government, is the further concentration of this funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is seven years since the Dawkinisation of the universities in this country, when the whole system was turned upside down. Institutions that had very little in common were forced to move into mergers to meet some magic number; they could not be universities unless they had a certain number. Whole careers were thrown into states of confusion. People resigned and morale collapsed. What we now have from this government is a de facto admission that this whole policy has failed, despite the best efforts of the staff of universities to make it work in the face of very inappropriate government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having forced these institutions together, having moved staff and told them, `If you want a promotion in a university you have to have a research record'&mdash;so they turned their careers upside down and got into higher degrees and further research&mdash;the government, in effect, is now saying, `Hey, wait a minute. We are not going to do that now; we're going to go back to what we had in the binary system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came out when I questioned one of the senior public servants, Mr Michael Gallagher, in the Senate estimates. He more or less admitted that if a university wanted to be a teaching university and do no research, it could do that. But he did not admit that the funding formula that the government is now applying will force many universities into that position and recreate the binary system we had before. Given how far we have come in recent years, this is a very backward step. This government stands condemned for this policy. It will be to the detriment of the reputation that Australia has built up in its universities. </PARA>

<PARA>The report of the Resource Assessment Commission highlights just how unlikely it is that export woodchipping will cease in the foreseeable future. Page 26 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no reason to discontinue woodchip exports. To do so would seriously disrupt industry and impose severe economic losses on forest-based industries and local communities.</PARA>
<PARA>This report is timely, given that just a little while ago the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) circulated a draft cabinet submission which seeks to tempt the environmental movement with the possible closure of the woodchip mill at Twofold Bay. The minister's long-awaited submission puts forward two options for the proposed East Coast Armaments Complex&mdash;Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay. The fact is that ECAC could only be built at Twofold Bay if the woodchip mill were closed and relocated in its entirety or, at the very least, regularly shut down while the armament wharf was in operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An environmental consultant to the recent interdepartmental committee on ECAC highlighted the fact that the woodchip mill might have to be closed. Our information is that compensation would run into hundreds of millions of dollars, much higher than the cost of ECAC itself. No wonder the consultant concluded that the woodchip mill problem could be sufficient to prevent the development of ECAC at Twofold Bay. It raises the question: why did the minister choose Twofold Bay as the only alternative to his preferred site at Jervis Bay? The answer is clear at least to me. He is making cabinet choose between the impossible and the unpalatable, knowing that the impossible would be defeated and the unpalatable&mdash;Jervis Bay&mdash;would get up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twofold Bay is nothing more than a straw site, a transparent ploy. The minister wants ECAC to go to Jervis Bay and he is trying to engineer a situation where it is the only real choice. I contend that this report which is before us now proves my point. The minister has dangled a carrot in front of the environmental movement. He is saying, `Support Twofold Bay as the alternative to Jervis Bay and you might just get the woodchip mill closed and replaced with ECAC'. The report we are now debating makes it clear that this is a false hope, a red herring. Cabinet would not in its right mind spend huge quantities of public money when much cheaper sites are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister succeeds in narrowing the choice down to these two sites, he will have eliminated any real opposition to Jervis Bay. It seems to me that that is his aim. Port Curtis near Gladstone, which has the most potential as an ECAC site, will have been struck off the list. I recently visited Port Curtis and, in discussions with local officials and environmentalists, it became clear that a mainland site for ECAC which would be much cheaper and more efficient than Facing Island&mdash;the only site Defence has looked at in that area&mdash;is in fact a real option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even Point Wilson in Victoria, which has a major question mark hanging over it because of Victoria's plan to move the Coode Island chemical facility to the same area, is a more realistic proposition than Twofold Bay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not have the opportunity to comment that that organisation was the one that canned the project in Sydney at a cost of $8 million. That project, a munitions factory that was started in 1984 under the Labor government, had just been completed. When ADI took over as a GBE, the first thing it did was close down this factory that never made a shell nor a bullet. Mr Deputy President, I know of your interest in the Bendigo factory, but I can tell you that the St Marys factory was the biggest waste of money that this country has seen for quite some time.

<PARA>That is absolutely true. My dealings and our committee's dealing with this organisation have shown us just what a private enterprise and a good government business enterprise can do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chairman of the authority is John Graham AM, former Managing Director of Civic Constructions Australia and the Managing Director is Mr Bill Kirkby-Jones AM, a fellow of the Australian Institute of Management and former Managing Director of the Housing Industry Association, the national employer body for the housing industry. They have taken what was&mdash;and still is, in some areas&mdash;the run-down housing stock of the Department of Defence and have made a very serious and a very meritorious attempt to turn the situation around so that our defence personnel are now being housed in up-to-date, modern houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very short period of time that this authority has been in existence&mdash;some six years&mdash;it has been so successful.

It has turned in a net operating profit of $71.2 million compared with its budget profit of $43 million, and it has total assets of $1.9 billion. It is so successful that the government, in its incessant haste to try to raise funds, asked the authority to repay a $300 million long-term loan, which it did. Even so, it is still managing to do the work that it set out to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the projects we looked at were quite outstanding. For instance, in Darwin in the Northern Territory, where it is very difficult to come up with suitable housing, the homes were rather expensive, but were outstanding homes by any standard.

The way the housing for the defence forces has been transformed by the creation of the Defence Housing Authority is one of the very few successes in the 10 years of this government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report we had yesterday from the veterans' affairs department had three pictures in it, two of them of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. This is nothing personal against Senator Faulkner. His predecessor certainly was in the same category. I wonder why that has become a tradition in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a successful year for the authority. The authority has cooperated very well with headquarters ADF and has coped with changes, such as the changes that have come from the movement of the defence forces around Australia&mdash;the move to the north for the army and the move to the west for the navy and the changes that come from the CSP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman notes in his own overview that the year under review was the most significant in the authority's six-year history. While acquisitions fell short of the target of 4,039 they represented a record level of activity compared with the 3,099 houses acquired last year. He also notes that there was a record operating profit after interest of $71.2 million compared with a budgeted profit of $43.3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is of particular interest to the government because it means that less money had to be allocated from the defence budget for defence housing. This is probably a high peak in profit because quite a volume of Commonwealth-state housing agreement stock was sold off and the benefit of that will be felt for another two years but after that I would imagine that the profit level will fall back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that concerns me as shadow minister for veterans' affairs is the way the government has been slow to revise salary and allowance payments to defence forces. Essentially, what happened before was that the defence forces had poor quality housing and they did not pay terribly much in rent. That rent was subsidised to some degree by the defence forces as part of the conditions of service, in recognition of the fact that defence families get moved at the whim of the government of the day, or more precisely the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened is that with the upgrade in quality of Defence Housing Authority housing and the provision of houses to service personnel there has been a move towards setting market rents as the rental allowance paid by service personnel. At the same time the amount of subsidy has come down and in general terms it is approaching 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the quality of housing has gone up, the ability for defence families to pay for that housing has been reduced. What the government has set out to do is correct the situation. But it has failed to recognise the fact that the capacity to pay is terribly important. It has not revised the pay scales particularly for the lower ranks so that they can pay for the better housing. </PARA>

<PARA>The first report which I have tabled deals with the redevelopment of the CSIRO Ian Clunies Ross laboratory complex at Prospect, New South Wales. It is proposed to relocate staff of the Division of Animal Health from the McMaster laboratory, Glebe and staff of the Division of Animal Production at the Poultry Research Unit at North Ryde to Prospect. It is also proposed to provide upgraded research facilities for existing staff of the Division of Animal Production at the Prospect site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McMaster laboratory at the University of Sydney, Glebe is occupied under permissive occupancy and needs to be vacated as soon as possible after June 1994. CSIRO considered several options before coming to the conclusion that the McMaster laboratory should relocate to the site at Prospect. At the public hearing the committee was advised that the relocation of the McMaster activities to Prospect is in the national interest in terms of the research synergy between McMaster and Prospect programs and Prospect is in a metropolitan location appropriate to research outputs for the manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relocation of the poultry facilities from North Ryde to Prospect was examined by the committee in 1991 and endorsed in its report to parliament in March 1992. The committee was advised that coordination of the move within this project will minimise costs and overcome potential cost penalties of a separate development. The Prospect site contains 41 major and minor buildings, many of which have reached the end of their useful life. Working conditions are cramped and the dated design of some buildings has made animal handling labour intensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing the committee was advised of the inter-institutional links between CSIRO and the University of Western Sydney, Nepean. The committee commends the CSIRO on these links, and believes that these will be strengthened once library facilities at Prospect are extended, thus providing access to a greater range of research material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also advised that the Wool Research and Development Corporation has a 100 per cent equity in the land at Prospect. The committee believes that the government should give consideration to transferring this equity in the site at Prospect to CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated cost of the proposal is $11.6 million at August 1992 prices. Any of my colleagues who are interested in the wool industry should, if they have the opportunity, arrange through that facility to see what research work is being done in the wool industry. I can only describe it as stunning. It is a pity that the minister in the chamber at the moment, the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), has not briefed this chamber on the research work being carried out there. Such information would be of great benefit and would give a lift to the woolgrowers who are suffering so much pain at the moment. I remind the minister that some of the experimental work that is going on at the moment is stunning and should be made known to the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other report which I have tabled is the committee's fifth report for 1993.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence proposes to rationalise its activities in the Inner Melbourne area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will affect premises in St Kilda Road which are currently leased. Some personnel will remain in the Inner Melbourne Area, others will be relocated&mdash;for example to RAAF Williams, another proposal being examined by the Committee at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will therefore be a surplus of leased accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Various studies have determined that by July 1996 there will be 2 379 Defence personnel in the inner Melbourne area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing leased premises would require substantial refurbishment to bring them up to modern office standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, if Defence were to remain in these buildings, substantial recurrent expenditure on rent and running costs would be incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence believes that most of these personnel could be accommodated at Victoria Barracks, provided the buildings within the barracks precinct are ungraded to a standard consistent with modern office accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what the RIMA project is all about&mdash;the refurbishment of buildings at Victoria Barracks&mdash;and the Committee has concluded that existing buildings in Victoria Barracks need to be substantially refurbished and upgraded to provide a modern and efficient office environment for Defence personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entire Victoria Barracks precinct is listed on the Register of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence therefore commissioned the preparation of a Conservation and Management Plan which concluded that there is no reason why any of the significant buildings cannot be adapted for re-use provided a number of guidelines are followed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence was also required to inform the Australian Heritage Commission of any proposed action and to give the Commission a reasonable opportunity to consider it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence did not formally advise the Commission of the action proposed until shortly before the Committee's public hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission was therefore unable to give full consideration to what is being proposed within the time frame required for submission to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Normally the Committee expects proponent departments or agencies to obtain environmental or heritage clearances of projects before they are referred to it for consideration. This was not possible in this particular instance because the proposal is in the pre-schematic design stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission acknowledged that Defence has the best track record of all departments in protecting its National Estate assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence also gave an unequivocal assurance that the Commission will be involved in the management process to ensure that heritage matters are taken fully into account during the detailed design process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal has the strong support of the local community and the Committee has recommended that Defence and the primary contractor liaise with local Commonwealth Employment Service offices to encourage the use of locally registered unemployed tradespeople on the project. The Council of the City of South Melbourne expressed strong support for the retention of the Defence headquarters in the City of South Melbourne.</PARA>

<PARA>This report concludes a two-year investigation by the committee into the administration of one of this country's largest and most significant institutions. For probably the first time in Australia a parliamentary committee has extensively investigated the manner in which income tax is collected. The inquiry was undertaken in recognition of the enormous changes in all aspects of the Australian Taxation Office and tax administration commenced at the beginning of the 1980s under the banner of modernisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry was commenced during the previous parliament under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Barton, Mr Punch. The committee accepted 128 public submissions, accounting for over 5,000 pages of evidence from ordinary taxpayers, academics, taxpayer agents, industry representatives, accounting and legal professionals, officers of the Taxation Office, senior tax office management and many others. In addition, it received more that 40 exhibits and considered a number of confidential documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report is a comprehensive assessment of the administration of the Taxation Office. While it is critical where necessary, it also recognises and commends the office for its many innovative and positive achievements, particularly in the areas of modernisation, self-assessment, personnel management and revenue collection. It also makes 148 recommendations, some of which I will now address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to legislative framework, in evaluating the tax office's performance, the committee has considered the efficiency of administering the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The committee has recognised that which must be painfully obvious to all in this parliament and, I would have to say, probably to all taxpayers in Australia&mdash;that the act is long overdue for redrafting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolve to simplify the act must come from the parliament. A commitment across political lines will be necessary for any redraft or rewriting to be effective. The committee has recognised that to redraft the act and simplify its administration will not be an easy process, nor will it be quick or inexpensive. Nevertheless, in the committee's view a redraft must be commenced urgently. The committee therefore recommends that sufficient resources be devoted to this exercise as a matter of the highest priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to administrative structures. After 80 years the committee considers the time is now ripe for the establishment of a new administrative framework for the tax office. The committee considered a number of options, including the establishment of a board of management. I might say that Senator Bishop, in a minority report, expressed a preference for a board. However, the committee determined that the Taxation Office should be constituted under its own act as the Australian taxation commission. Through such a commission it was felt that the advantages of a board could be embraced. In addition, a commission would facilitate the use of experts in executive roles on either a full-time or part-time basis. It was also felt that a commission would allow for a more flexible system for the employment of taxation professionals and provide the capacity to respond to changing international and domestic priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has carefully and comprehensively considered the system of private and public rulings issued by the commissioner. The committee has recognised the importance and significance of rulings for taxpayers. As an administrator, the Commissioner of Taxation has no authority to create law. Nevertheless, as a result of both legislative changes and the financial barriers in assessing judicial review, the committee acknowledges that the word of the commissioner has come to be seen by many as de facto or quasi law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee gave extensive consideration to proposals to make the commissioner's rulings subordinate law through the procedures of tabling and disallowance. While this mechanism would provide parliamentary scrutiny and an effective discipline in the exercise of the commissioner's powers and discretions, the committee considered that there were significant practical difficulties in such a system. In particular, the possibilities of delay and increased uncertainty, the need to establish a capacity within the parliament capable of analysing and evaluating technical and complex administrative guidelines, and the capacity of the commissioner to avoid the parliament through an issue of other administrative guidelines were considered to be so significant as to militate against the introduction of such a system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the committee has concluded that parliamentary review is both necessary and desirable. The committee has recommended that all public rulings be tabled in the parliament and be available for review by the parliament's committees. In this way, the interpretations, discretions and powers of the commissioner can best be monitored and an effective deterrent to the abuse of power established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was of the opinion that, to a large extent, public rulings could be construed as delegated legislation&mdash;hence, the consideration given to whether they should be just tabled or whether they should be subject to disallowance. In the end, it was decided to recommend that the rulings be tabled in the parliament. I understand that there were 45 rulings last year. The reason the request was made for tabling is that, in the main, neither parliamentarians nor the general public at large have any idea of what rulings are made&mdash;they have no idea whatsoever. The committee had the opportunity to recommend that the rulings be made public and, hence, making the taxation commissioner more subject to scrutiny and more accountable to the parliament and thus the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of the self-assessment system, the importance of taxation auditing to the detection of taxpayers who fail to comply with the law has been paramount. The powers of taxation auditors to access information are both extensive and exceptional. The committee carefully reviewed the auditing function. Its recommendations for change seek to establish a professional independent audit operation which is balanced and efficient. Through the separation of the information gathering and analysis functions from the decision making process, the committee considers that the powers of the auditors can be better harnessed and the independence of final decisions enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the small claims tribunal. There can be little doubt that access to our judicial system has become the privilege of the privileged. It has become so expensive. In the field of taxation this is even more the case as there is no legal aid available to those citizens who wish to challenge the tax office. The committee has recognised this dilemma and urges the establishment of a low cost facility for the resolution of taxation claims below $5,000. While such a facility would not be judicial, it would allow issues of principle and importance to individuals to be argued and settled in a manner which is both practical and equitable. Under the committee's proposal, issues of significance could still be resolved by judicial interpretation where it was considered necessary. However, if the Taxation Office elected to go that route, such determinations would be paid for by the taxpayers and not by the single individual taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee has evaluated and considered a number of models for a taxpayers' charter of rights. While such statements can satisfy a number of possible goals, the committee concluded that their merit lay in the focus they provided to administration. The committee considered that the extent and description of what constituted a `right' of taxpayers should be detailed in a charter which is readily available for public scrutiny. In addition, the Taxation Office should be required to provide standards of service in accordance with the rights detailed in the charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some other major recommendations in the report include the funding of a taxation ombudsman within the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office, the removal of administrative culpability penalties, the need for a review of the financial position of the Taxation Office and the payment by the Taxation Office of the service fee for lodgment of tax returns on the electronic lodgment service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while it would always be possible to find examples of deficiencies in any organisation of 18,000 people, the committee recognised that these examples are the exception rather than the rule. Nevertheless, they are exceptions which affect individual taxpayers. The taxation system must be made capable of managing such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report acknowledges that the Taxation Office has been a progressive organisation and generally its management has attempted to produce an efficient public organisation. Thus, while the committee does not condone any inefficiency, it has sought in its 148 recommendations to achieve a structure that will improve the overall administration, reduce costs and provide justice and equity to taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would take this opportunity to thank all the members of the public accounts committee who have participated in the work of the inquiry. In particular, I would like to offer special thanks to Senator Watson and Senator Bishop, who participated in this inquiry from the beginning. I was not on the sectional committee and I only recently became part of the full committee. Hence, one must pay tribute to the incredible amount of work and effort put in by those people over two years to produce this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I would like to place on record my appreciation, and I am sure that of all the members of the committee, of the staff of the secretariat of the public accounts committee. I express my sincere gratitude to the committee secretary, Mr Trevor Rowe; to the sectional committee secretaries, Ms Geraldine Skinner and Ms Sue Morton; to the secretariat staff, in particular Mrs Lorraine Brennan and Ms Yolanda Campagna; and to all the other staff members who have spent so many long hours preparing this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the committee's adviser, Mr Simon Edwards, who was seconded to the committee during the inquiry from the Department of Finance, I would like to extend the committee's appreciation for the tireless and professional manner in which he performed his duties. Finally, I would offer the committee's thanks to Mr Peter Dowling, of Ernst and Young in Brisbane, who was engaged in the latter stages of the compilation of the report as a technical consultant to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this report will provide a platform for a modernised Taxation Office to move into the 21st century as a servant of the Australian people. Like all tax assessments, this report is not all that good and not all that bad. But in view of the incredible amount of evidence and time taken, I believe that in the main it is an excellent report. Nevertheless, there is much to be done in our taxation system to make it better. I believe the expeditious agreement by the government to the adoption of this report's recommendations will be a significant step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of a final comment, I would say that the general thrust of the report is to move the balance in a way that is more equitable to the taxpayers than has been the case in the past. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

It has been a long haul because the government originally opposed my wanting to make that reference to find justice for those people. My motion in this place to have that matter referred to the public accounts committee was vociferously opposed by Senator Button. But at the end of the day this matter was referred to the committee and, with Mr Punch, we worked to find justice for the people who had been destroyed by the actions of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to examine the Australian Taxation Office, I was again ever mindful of the fact that there is an unequal struggle between the might of the Taxation Office with its open-ended purse and individual Australians who find that they have no resources to fight back. I have a very high file in my office. I have an agreement from the new Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, that we will sit down together, now that this report has come down, and go through those complaints by ordinary Australians who find that they have been harshly treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have called my report a minority report as distinct from a dissenting report because its aim is to add things which I thought needed to be dealt with but which were not dealt with in the body of the report, and to flesh out and deal with more fully some items in the main report. Consequently, there is much in the majority report with which I agree and concur but there are other things which I felt needed to be said in the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two important areas where I do, in fact, disagree with the majority report. The first area is the creation of a commission. I have stood in this place too often and heard ministers say, when they are asked questions about bodies which are corporations or indeed commissions, that they cannot and will not answer because they are at arm's length. To me, the Australian Taxation Office must be directly accountable to this parliament. Its officers must appear before estimates committees. There must be a thorough and ongoing accountability to the parliament for the way in which the commissioner exercises the vast amount of discretionary powers that he has under various pieces of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just explaining it to the minister. As I said, a commission is further distanced from accountability to the parliament. So I have recommended that it be a board. Further, I have spelt out the ways in which the board and the commissioner should interact and the accountability that should be directed to the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of rulings there was a further disagreement. I believe that this matter is of paramount importance. Those who read my minority report&mdash;and I strongly suggest that people do&mdash;will find that one of my major concerns about the manner in which public rulings are made is that they do in fact have the force of law. The commissioner declares that he is actually not making law but, to all intents and purposes, he is. I deal at some length with the constitutional questions that are raised in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I have said and insisted&mdash;not only at the end of the inquiry but also during the inquiry&mdash;that tabling and disallowance should be applicable to rulings; that, indeed, they should be made in accordance with the ordinary regulation making powers contained within the ordinary taxation legislation. Senator Parer in his tabling address said that the committee was concerned that those rulings should be tabled, but that is merely a method of publishing them. My concern is that the law is made by the parliament. Under our constitution it is the parliament that is required to impose laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As honourable senators all remember, we had quite a disagreement with the government over the method of imposing taxation when the question of the budget was being dealt with in this place. Mr Dawkins had wished to place a number of tax impositions and tax cuts in a single omnibus bill, but a committee of this place indicated that it would be likely to be found to be unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I recommend as follows: that the relevant Commonwealth tax acts be amended to provide that general public rulings be issued as regulations under the taxation laws and subject to tabling and disallowance in the parliament to enable persons dissatisfied with a general, that is public, ruling to object to it in the same manner that the legislation now provides for persons to object to a private ruling, and to provide that, where a private ruling applies for more than one year, the acceptance of the private ruling by the person to whom it was issued trigger off the appeal procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a grave concern that with regard to private rulings some may get them and others may not. There is no provision in the present legislation to force a private ruling to be made one way or the other. And of course there is the extraordinary power conferred on the commissioner that he can revoke a private ruling on the basis that he has identified some other group of people that may be affected by the private ruling in a way which he considers to be adverse&mdash;a very curious conferring of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We go to the question of taxpayers' rights. There was agreement in the committee that taxpayers' rights had to be recognised. Again, that goes to the very heart of the question of justice and equity. At the moment it is a very unfair contest. If we were to use the level playing field terminology we could say that the field is very much tilted in favour of the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the comments of the majority report on the requirement of a charter of taxpayers' rights, but where I add to the majority report is to say that it should not be a mere statement of platitudes or intentions; it should serve to focus on the discretionary powers vested in the taxation administration and the remedies and safeguards that have been inbuilt to tax legislation to prevent the unauthorised use of such powers. It should also set out the procedures for seeking such remedies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore make a recommendation that a charter should include, but not be limited to, the rights of taxpayers and the obligations of the Australian Taxation Office during the conduct of an audit&mdash;a very important question. Many firms feel that they are put upon by the intrusion of the Taxation Office and very often they will settle those claims on the basis of simply getting them out of their hair. Secondly, there are the procedures by which a taxpayer may appeal an adverse finding by the Australian Taxation Office and, thirdly, there are the procedures that the Australian Taxation Office may use to enforce taxation laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report listed the basic entitlements which could be expressed in such a charter. I concur with these points but stress that they do not constitute a comprehensive list of the necessary rights to be recognised. So in the meantime I think it is urgent that we look upon certain sections of the tax act which I think need to be dealt with as a matter of some urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 263 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and similar provisions in other taxation laws should be amended to provide that the powers of entry and search only be permitted with a warrant issued by a judicial officer and that the written authorisation carried by the officers of the Commissioner of Taxation attempting to gain entry under section 263 show on its face the premises to be searched and the books, documents and other papers or classes thereof which are the subject of the search, and that the guidelines issued by the Commissioner of Taxation in July 1991 which were concerned with the exercise of powers under section 263 to access documents held on lawyers' premises in circumstances where a claim for legal professional privilege is made be included in the taxation acts of the Commonwealth or in regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then go on to deal with the highly important question of tax reform and tax law simplification. Two things have occurred. Firstly, the law has become more and more complex because of the way in which legislation is drafted. The technique used is to try to imagine any particular loophole or exception or occurrence that may occur in the future. The result is that we have hugely complicated legislation, the meaning of which is not readily available to or understandable by ordinary Australians&mdash;and if the law is not comprehensible, then it is not good law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when we talk about the purpose of that legislation, which has been to do away with evasion and avoidance, we also look at the question of simplification. But let me deal first with the question of evasion and avoidance. In the 10 years that Mr Keating has been either Treasurer or Prime Minister, all tax changes or so-called reforms have been brought in to, so-called, get rid of evasion and avoidance. Yet the Auditor-General now qualifies the financial statements of the Australian Taxation Office on the basis that the commissioner has not worked out a means of estimating how much revenue is still being evaded or avoided. The last time he was able to do that was for the 1985 tax summit. After that we have had to rely upon academics and others who are doing their own research and publishing, so that the most recent figure we have is one from an academic, which shows that perhaps the forgone revenue by way of evasion and avoidance is some $6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To counter this, as I said, the tax gap which has been identified by the Auditor-General and which has resulted in the financial statements of the Australian Taxation Office being qualified for the last several years means that we have no measure, no ready reckoner, of whether or not the laws that are being introduced and administered by the tax act have been effective. So I have made a very strong recommendation that there be an outside review of how we can find a proper way of measuring that tax gap so that we can know whether there is efficiency in the administration of that office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One will also find in my minority report a detailed analysis of the manner in which Mr Boucher handled the modernisation agreements, both with the finance department and with the Public Sector Union. Those two agreements are in competition with each other. The promises made to the Department of Finance could not be met because of the effect of the Public Sector Union. One will find from the evidence that the Taxation Office was going to be $114 million short over a period of some two to three years; that if it did not get an injection of additional money, that is, $114 million, it was going to be unable to pay the salary bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement with the Public Sector Union meant that the Taxation Office could not shed the staff that it was required to do under its agreement with the Department of Finance, in return for which the Department of Finance authorised the Taxation Office to spend $1.2 billion of taxpayers' money to so-called modernise the Taxation Office. That modernisation program can be measured only if we see the sorts of mechanisms put in place that I talk about in the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of our failure to have that standard by which to measure the Taxation Office, we then looked at, both in evidence to the public accounts committee and in estimates, how effective the various shall we say, profit centres, of the tax office are&mdash;that is, the various particular varieties of tax. I think honourable senators will find it interesting to note that the fringe benefits tax, which both the majority report and I recommend should be looked at in terms of being simplified and made more certain, has been one of the few growth areas of taxation revenue. But whether or not that is because more revenue is being collected under existing legislation or whether it is because new fringe benefits were added to the fringe benefits tax is not disclosed in any of the material provided by the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also dealt with in my minority report is the infamous black hole in the last budget of Mr Dawkins. After the budget was brought down it was discovered by the opposition that, indeed, there was a hole in the figures provided and that, when supporting documentation was read, one saw that new taxes, withholding taxes, were being foreshadowed for subsequent taxation years. There was also a minute tabled by Mr Boucher showing that he thoroughly supported withholding tax as the strategy to be pursued for the collection of tax to meet revenue targets, and yet he finally backed away from his own recommendations. When questions were asked about that black hole, the provision of the additional $114 million, the fact that that $114 million was needed for salaries to be paid and that, in the space of less than three weeks, $1.7 million was able to be found by way of additional compliance, we found that there were no answers forthcoming, and the reason for that change of mind remains a mystery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will find that I deal with a number of items relating to the politicisation of the Taxation Office&mdash;everything from the special treatment given by the deputy commissioner to Mr Keating over the failure to lodge tax returns, when ordinary Australians were prosecuted for that, to the way the commissioner dealt differently with information sought by the Fitzgerald inquiry and information sought by the WA Inc Royal Commission. Those questions remain unresolved, but the evidence remains on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main concern in bringing down this report is that we see fairness and equity in the tax system. For that reason, I have also dealt with the question of capital gains tax. It is a discriminatory tax which is now being expanded by the way in which, by public rulings, law is effectively being made. I deal in the minority report with Hepple's case; the comments of the High Court, which said this was a matter for the parliament to fix, not the court; and with the subsequent amendment to the act and the way in which that has failed to fix the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capital gains tax in terms of revenue that it was originally stated it would meet has not met those targets. But it has been a distorting tax in that, because the family home is exempted, savings have certainly been distorted. One did not have to be very smart to work out that that was going to occur. For that reason, and because it is a de facto wealth tax and a de facto death duties tax in many circumstances, I believe that justice and equity in the tax system would be better served not by taxing the family home&mdash;which is anathema to me&mdash;but by replacing the capital gains tax with a speculative gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions of revenue that would have to be found certainly can be dealt with by identifying compliance and the tax gap that I have referred to by having a systematic and comprehensive system of indicators so that we can know how well or how badly the Taxation Office is being administered. Mr Carmody is new in the job. He held a press conference this afternoon and he said that he would be reading all of the report. He has said that he will certainly read my minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My overwhelming interest is to see that ordinary Australians get a fair go and are no longer en masse described by the commissioner or his office as being tax cheats. Most ordinary Australians are hard working people who try very hard to comply with all laws. The law is complex as it is, and I am reminded of the fact that when the tax pack was first published, it was intended to mean that more Australians would be able to furnish their own returns but, in fact, what occurred was that the number of Australians who used accountants to furnish their returns went up; one look at that tax pack and it frightened them to death, me included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, my concern for ordinary individual Australians to have a fair go under the bureaucracy began with the vast injustices that were perpetrated in the Paramount Midford case when reputations, health and businesses were destroyed by the act of the bureaucracy. It was only through individual members of parliament&mdash;and I was very pleased to play a part&mdash;that it was brought to the attention of the public, the parliament and the government with a recommendation that compensation be paid that we finally saw some justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By bringing in a minority report today, I believe that I can help ensure that we see less injustice for ordinary Australians so that we do not see in the area of the Australian Tax Office the sort of injustice that was brought down by the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again that there is much in the majority report with which I concur and, indeed, was involved with in gathering evidence during the course of the inquiry, but I also felt that there were extra things that needed to be said. I commend both reports to the general readership but I believe that the two areas where I am in disagreement do need thorough consideration, because tabling and disallowance, and a board and not a commission, is the correct way to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few revenue collecting agencies around the world in recent times have attracted such public attention as the Australian Taxation Office. In recent years both the law and the office itself have undergone enormous changes with implications for both tax officials and taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to be associated with the joint committee report No. 326, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Assessment of Tax</EMPHASIS>. This was a report of an inquiry into the Australian Tax Office and although its presentation has taken longer than I would have wished, it is nevertheless an important document. The changes that have been undertaken by the Taxation Office in its reform between the presentation of submissions and hearings reflect to the credit of the Taxation Office because many of the difficult issues were addressed prior to the presentation of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I have not had quite the input since August when I stepped down from my position as Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts because of my duties as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I wish to thank the members of the committee publicly for their unanimous agreement to invite me to have a final input into the draft report. This I did, and I thank the committee for that. I also wish to acknowledge that this report is a balanced report with criticisms for and against the tax office. Ultimately, while not perfect, it does reflect the many thousands of hours of research, hearings and deliberations that were put into this final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that without the submissions from outsiders the quality of the report would have been less than it is at present. I wish to thank all those people from the private and public sectors who put so many hours into the manner and the professionalism of their presentations. While naturally not agreeing with every aspect of its contents, I nevertheless believe that it will make an important contribution to the further development of the Taxation Office, to tax administration and, hopefully, to the reform of taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to join with my colleague Senator Parer in paying tribute to all those members of the public accounts committee and the secretariat who have worked so hard in terms of the final outcome; it has taken many months to prepare. I particularly draw attention to the contributions of Mrs Laraine Brennan for her typing and secretarial skills, to Mr Simon Edwards, who is from the Department of Finance, for much of the writing of the report, and also to Mr Peter Dowling, a partner of the accountancy firm of Ernst and Young, who acted as both a consultant and a technical adviser to the committee during the finalisation of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to place on the public record my acknowledgment and deep appreciation to my colleagues both in the parliament and the secretariat for a rather special dinner and the presentation of a signed encomium as a tribute to my 15 years on the public accounts committee. I was deeply moved by both the dinner and the encomium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Bishop for her remarks about my contribution to her minority report. I think her minority report reflects matters that are of deep importance to Senator Bishop and that she felt compelled to put them on the public record in the way in which she has done. I commend people to read that minority report, which is attached to the end of the major report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, during the 1960s and 1970s, it is now recognised that there was widespread tax avoidance. In more recent years, the pendulum has swung very much, in fact too much, the other way. I believe that it was the movement of this pendulum that was the essential concern to Senator Bishop throughout the deliberations of the hearings. I think this is reflected in her very thoughtful contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is one matter that I must draw attention to that received a great deal of media attention&mdash;that is, the vigorous exchange between my colleague Senator Bishop and the Commissioner of Taxation. In fact, one friend of mine suggested that perhaps the title of the report should more appropriately be called `The Bishop and the tax collector' because of that media exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that I have thought long and hard about. In considering the very long involvement of the previous commissioner, Mr Boucher, and his leading role in the development of the modern Taxation Office, I do think the report rightly acknowledges that Trevor Boucher was the architect of the modern office and, therefore, he needs that recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think neither the proceedings that took place leading to that report nor the report itself really should contain a reflection or a stain on his character, and I make no apology that I sought to achieve this end. I do not believe that Senator Bishop sought to do that. But, at the same time, as a parliamentarian, I respect her right to ask the sorts of questions that she did; they were pertinent at the time. I think my conduct during the debate adequately reflected that Senator Bishop had the right to ask those questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, I believed that it was important, especially as it was on the eve of Trevor Boucher's retirement, that neither the proceedings could be construed nor should the report be written in such a way that could have reflected to future generations any possibility of stain. Naturally, if there was any reflection, I certainly sought to remove it, and I make no apology for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop also had concerns about distancing the commission, as recommended, from the parliament. I would like to think that having had such close parliamentary contact with the Taxation Office, the issues that I hope that I put into the report will ensure that those parliamentary links with the Taxation Office will not only be preserved but also strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw attention to the enormous amount of time that parliamentarians put into these reports. I think it is important to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that following a long evening&mdash;we often had heated exchanges as to how issues should be expressed&mdash;my colleague from the House of Representatives Mr Alex Somlyay unfortunately suffered a heart attack. I think it is appropriate that we should place on the record our wish of a speedy and complete recovery from his hospitalisation. I think it reflects the fact that we work hard in this place, that we put in long hours and that from time to time one of the consequences is ill health. I commend you, Mr Acting Deputy President, on the role that you are playing in attempting to have more sensible hours in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there have been many calls for the rewriting of the tax act, I issue a warning that it is not necessarily the Income Tax Assessment Act but perhaps the Fringe Benefits Tax Act that contains the greatest pitfalls nowadays or the greatest problems for taxpayers. I note my colleague Senator Bishop's comments in this regard. But in all these calls for the rewriting of the tax act, we have to acknowledge that, if the underlying premise is fundamentally wrong, plain English will not solve taxpayers' problems. It will be a complex task, and I urge the involvement of practitioners and academics outside the Taxation Office in that rewriting exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that one of the difficulties that taxpayers face nowadays is the failure, perhaps of the Taxation Office, to always acknowledge the important rule of law concept of precedent because without the acceptance of precedent there can be no certainty before the law. I think there are enough cases to indicate, perhaps, a need for a direction to the tax office in upholding this very important concept of precedents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the other question of the emphasis of audit on grey areas. Certainty before the law is an utmost requirement in any taxation which relies on self-assessment. Therefore, in closing, I commend honourable senators to read the majority report and also the minority report, written by my colleague Senator Bishop. I think both these documents, and the attachments, will reflect significantly the further developments and modernisation of the tax office. I wish tax offices and others who will be involved in this process well. </PARA>

I think I was developing the point that it is difficult to in all circumstances have a member representative as a trustee of a fund because some funds have a very high turnover of membership due to the type of industry that they are representing. I gave an illustration of the hospitality industry, where there can be an average turnover of staff of 100 per cent per quarter. It might sound a staggering figure, but it is not unusual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A trustee can be appointed and then leave that industry to seek or take up employment elsewhere, therefore having to leave the fund as a trustee.

The other problem, which Senator Kernot touched on, is that this would mean that in some funds the trustee would have to resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Watson himself has acknowledged the very high standards of management of these industry funds. There does not appear to be an argument that the management in any way would be improved by these amendments. The majority of industry funds are quite large. They are not small funds with under 100 or 200 members. Many funds&mdash;probably the majority&mdash;would have tens of thousands of members. So we are dealing with funds that are very large and in which, in a sense, a professional full-time approach of time, demand and training is required.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth had to rely on the trading or financial corporations power and the old age pension power contained in section 51 (xx) and (xxiii) of the Commonwealth constitution in order to enact this legislation. I remind the Senate that one effect of the bill is that trust deeds for all superannuation funds will have to be amended to require the trustee of the fund to be a trading or financial corporation for the purpose of the fund to provide an old age pension. </PARA>

I remind the Senate of our recommendation that there essentially should be one return filed with the ISC and that when the ISC updates its computerised facilities then it will be in a position to accept that recommendation and to lodge any necessary fee or subsequent return with the ASC. Therefore, it will be necessary for the Australian Securities Commission to come up with a form of company structure which will simplify annual returns and this new compliance requirement.

Those are the provisions which will impose obligations on employers, actuaries and auditors, particularly in circumstances where the employers, the actuaries and the auditors are individuals rather than corporations or where they are non-corporate partnerships. Can we have certain assurances from the government and the advisers that the provisions of this bill will not be unconstitutional and that, therefore, the ISC will be in a position to be able to enforce the provisions against individuals and partnerships if they are not in a corporate state?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is addressing the Copyright Amendment (Re-enactment) Bill 1993. The bill, as the name implies, is a re-enactment of the 1989 amendment act, which has become invalid due to a decision by the High Court in May 1993. The provision which was fatal to the whole legislation related to the royalty payable on blank audio tapes. The High Court found the royalty to be a tax and that it therefore violated section 55 of the constitution which provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laws imposing taxation shall only deal with the imposition of taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA>The provisions of the 1993 bill do not effect any policy change or new initiative. They are directed solely to re-enacting the amendments to the principal act made by the amending act of 1989, with the exception of those imposing, and related to the imposition of, the blank tape royalty. Thus, the amendments propose to do the following: protect performers from unauthorised recording or broadcasting of their live performances; enable educational institutions and institutions assisting the handicapped to copy television programs off air in return for payment to copyright owners; streamline the existing licences to educational institutions for photocopying by abandoning requirements for record keeping and payments for actual copying, and substituting an estimate payment scheme with charges made per student; remove copyright protection for industrially applied artistic works and so remove the duplication of protection under the Designs Act 1906; streamline the existing statutory licence for record manufacture; and make various other miscellaneous amendments primarily of a technical nature, given that the validation will be retrospective and, therefore, the stages of commencement of various parts of the amending act and the actual dates of the deemed commencement of particular sections are already known.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Spindler has outlined, the Copyright Amendment (Re-enactment) Bill 1993 simply seeks to validate all those portions of the Copyright Amendment Act that was passed in 1989, except those dealing with the blank tape royalty, which, as Senator Spindler and others pointed out earlier, was held by the High Court to be a tax. As a consequence, the whole bill, in effect, was held to be invalid because taxing bills can deal with only one subject of taxation and they must deal only with the imposition of tax. The blank tape royalty, which was held to be a tax, was so inextricably entwined with the other bits that the whole lot fell.

<PARA>I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Copyright Amendment (Re-enactment) Bill 1993 is to repeal and re-enact, with retrospective effect, all the provisions of the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 that made amendments to the principal act except those related to the blank tape royalty. The bill is necessary because of the opinion of the Chief General Counsel that the whole of the 1989 act is invalid as a result of the court decision concerning the constitutional invalidity of the blank tape royalty, which was referred to by Senator Spindler and Senator Vanstone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 11 of the bill is a provision to ensure that regulations made under any invalid provisions are clearly validated. It does so by deeming them to have been made under the authority of the 1993 act but commencing on the dates that the regulations purported to commence. Such regulations include those made in respect of performer protection, provisions for which were included in the 1989 act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this had been thought sufficient to protect the validity of the subordinate legislation, it had been overlooked that under sections 135P and 135ZZB, included in new parts VA and VB, provision was made for the declaration of certain collecting societies to be made by the Attorney-General. The respective declarations of the Audio-visual Copyright Society Ltd and the Copyright Agency Limited were published in the government notices section of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> No. 24 on 20 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the bill has not included specific provisions covering these declarations, there may be doubt as to whether they are saved simply by the retrospective enactment of the primary provisions. This proposed amendment remedies this omission and resolves any doubt. It will add a new clause&mdash;clause 10A&mdash;which states specifically that the declarations made under the retrospective provisions set out in the clause are taken to have been made in the 1993 act but operate from the making of the declarations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment is thus in the same form as clause 11 of the bill. It refers specifically to the two clauses&mdash;135P and 135ZZB&mdash;so as to clearly identify the declarations that are the subject of this special provision. There are no other declarations or notices by the Attorney-General requiring this treatment, and there is no financial impact on the Commonwealth. That having been said, I thank the opposition and the Australian Democrats for their support of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But because this bill was first introduced in November 1988 and dealt with in May 1989, it is a bit hard to find an excuse as to why we missed this. A cursory look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I underline that it was a cursory look&mdash;shows Senator Reynolds explaining in 1988 that this might have a minor financial impact due to extra money from the blank tape royalty going into the indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did a search through the volumes of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see whether anyone raised the argument that this might be considered a tax.

Of course, on a few occasions the Senate has come to a different view&mdash;so has the High Court&mdash;from that of the chief parliamentary counsel. Nonetheless, there were so many people saying, `There is a risk in this'. This presents an example of where the government's own counsel was saying that there was a risk.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is the government's main budget bill, dealing with current expenditure&mdash;recurrent ordinary services of government. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) is for the capital expenditure requirements of government. Together with the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill, those bills constitute the government's budget bills and they appropriate funds for areas of expenditure outlined in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 1), the subject of this debate, seeks appropriations from the consolidated revenue fund in 1993-94 of almost $29 billion for the recurrent ordinary services of government. That level of spending represents a 2.6 per cent increase on the previous year's actual expenditure and is 6.3 per cent higher than the appropriation in last year's Appropriation Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes out from the appropriation bills the government's outlays for state and territory governments, one finds a much more significant increase in the Commonwealth government's own purpose outlays. Indeed, they would have risen by 7.6 per cent in nominal terms or 4.1 per cent in real terms from last year's budget. That demonstrates yet again the inability of this government to exercise the necessary controls over its own expenditure to work towards a sensible approach to the deficit and to economic and fiscal policy in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Commonwealth has done over recent years&mdash;this year is no exception&mdash;is squeeze very hard on payments to the states; at the same time, it has gone on its merry way, spending without constraint for its own purposes. Although of a minor magnitude, a classic example of the philosophy and the arrogance that underline that is the recent revelations of the Prime Minister's penchant for Thai teak tables at the Lodge and for Gould bird prints in the cabinet room, at an extra cost of $100,000 to Australian taxpayers. There are already 3,000 works of art in the parliament, all of which would very appropriately be able to adorn the cabinet room. It is all part of the approach of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the proposed taxation and other revenue measures are taken into account&mdash;and they are the bills that have all been dealt with in recent weeks&mdash;this budget has been an unmitigated disaster for the government, both politically and in simple economic terms. Although Appropriation Bill (No. 1) is the main budget bill, it seeks to appropriate only a relatively small proportion of the government's total expenditure requirements this financial year, namely, $29 billion. That is because most of the expenditure by government is appropriated through other bills, for example, the social security bill and the like. Nevertheless, this bill is an extremely important bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government believes that tax increases are the way to stimulate the economy. That is really what it has done in this budget. It has increased taxes&mdash;and I will come back to this in a moment&mdash;except for the small cut in personal income tax that has taken effect this week. It is nonsense to suggest, as the government does, that by increasing the overall level of taxation it will stimulate the economy. Economic growth and the related desperately sought employment growth are not advanced by tax rises, yet this budget has attempted to do just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income tax cuts that have taken effect this week range between approximately $8 and $12 a week depending on one's income, and that is provided one has an income of more than $23,000 a year or thereabouts. Low income earners get virtually nothing at all. They will get nothing at all by way of income tax reductions this financial year. They will get a measly, paltry $150 by way of tax rebate which will not be paid for almost another 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those income tax reductions will provide Australians with an extra $1.7 billion in their pockets in 1993-94. That will escalate over the next four years by an additional $12 billion or so. That does not sound too bad, does it? But on the other hand, those tax cuts are dwarfed absolutely by the $31.6 billion in additional tax revenue that the government plans to reap from Australians over the next four years. Despite the income tax cuts, over the next four years every Australian will pay an extra $1,800 in tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the much vaunted second round of income tax cuts, promised in the One Nation statement in February 1992 and promised at the time of the election, which were to be worth $5.2 billion in 1995-96 have been abandoned. Of course Labor's minor income tax cuts that we have seen this week have been provided to all Australians at a very high price indeed considering the increase in sales tax, fuel tax and wine tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment figures that were announced last week showed another very disturbing result of 11.2 per cent. We are now supposedly, according to the government, two years into an economic recovery, yet unemployment has hovered around 11 per cent for the last 12 months and there are no signs that the unemployment rate will come down in the near future. The very limited economic growth in the economy at the moment is barely sufficient to accommodate new job seekers let alone satisfy the employment needs of the one million Australians already unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reports in the press suggesting that the Treasury and the Reserve Bank are forecasting a very low 0.3 per cent growth in GDP for the September quarter have not been refuted. Indeed, in the Senate estimates committee hearings these claims were, if anything, confirmed. That will very likely take our annual growth for the year below the 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 per cent figure forecast at budget time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister once said so eloquently that if we cannot get four per cent GDP growth then `you might as well give up the game'. He has been Prime Minister for nearly two years now and he has never got within a bull's roar of four per cent economic growth. He should have given up the game long ago and followed his own edict of that time and saved millions of Australian families and businesses from the suffering and hardship that they have endured over recent years and are continuing to endure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of the present situation&mdash;and the issue that concerns all Australians&mdash;is that this Labor government has nothing to offer Australians to overcome our economic and related problems. The government is directionless and without a coherent policy structure. Worse still, it has clearly run out of both ideas and energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is rife with splits. We have had a major split between the two main economic ministers, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), in the last couple of weeks over the question of taxes. The Treasurer adamantly said that taxes will not go up and the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, very clearly raised the possibility of future tax increases. It is less than 10 days ago that he said that the government's deficit strategy may involve some revenue increases, though the government will be very cautious about introducing any substantial additional tax increases. By saying that, Finance Minister Willis is quite clearly indicating that the government is certainly contemplating the need for tax increases in the period ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will spending be cut to make way for the additional spending promises made for the Olympics, labour programs, Mabo and so on? If the government is to stick with its target of reducing the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97&mdash;that one per cent is creeping out, it is already up to 1.2 per cent&mdash;how will that target be met unless either expenditure in other areas is cut or taxes increased. It appears highly likely, given the statements of the ministers, that both will occur. So there have been major splits between the fundamental economic ministers. There has been a split over the reform agenda of the government. </PARA>

<PARA>This relates to the government's reform of Australia Post. The government wimped out on the necessary reforms to Australia Post. It added to the very strong wait as to the doubts about the government's capacity to follow through on a reform road in terms of micro-economic and structural reform in this country. We all know this reform is absolutely essential and the government has completely lost the stomach for it, if it ever had it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main person that should be driving that reform, the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, is becoming increasingly isolated within his own ranks. There are increasing doubts being cast about his political judgment and credibility and that augurs ill not just for Mr Dawkins but for government economic policy making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are continuing to fall further behind international best practice in many key micro-economic areas. Our waterfront, despite government attempts at reform, is still well off the mark of international comparability. Our shipping and rail systems are inefficient. Our communications reform has proven to be a disaster with the pay TV debacle. Taxation and business regulatory reform is long overdue. This has been talked about for nearly a decade but precious few, if any, advancements of a significant nature have been made. By most standards the cost of compliance in these areas is increasing rather than decreasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen splits over industrial relations with the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, being rolled by the trade unions, which were intent on maintaining their power over all necessary and reasonable reform. The industrial relations package, which is being debated at this very moment in the other House, sets the process of reform backwards. It does not take it forward. The package represents the worst of trade union privilege and puts trade unions further above the law. It discriminates against most private sector employees, thwarts freedom of contract in the workplace and leaves those hoping for job prospects to contemplate a permanent future dependent on welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the stark choice that the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Evans, put to the nation recently in a very important speech. He said that we have chosen a high level of unemployment&mdash;that was the implication of his remarks&mdash;because we have not been able to drive the necessary reforms, particularly so far as the labour market is concerned. Whilst that might help people who are lucky enough to maintain their job, it does precious little for those who are unable to find a job or who are squeezed out of the work force as a result of all of those situations. The No.1 issue in Australia is unemployment, yet this government cannot offer any options for dealing with it, let alone finding any solutions. As I said, the industrial relations package is a further nail in the coffin of the unemployed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1993-94, I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter that has been worrying me for some time. In fact, this matter has come to my attention as chairman of the opposition's waste watch committee. From what I have seen, there is something very wrong with Australia's major communication carrier, Telstra, formerly known as Telecom. Over the last six months I have been involved in investigating a number of allegations of malpractice by Telstra which have been made by both former and present employees. In that time I have met personally with a number of individuals who have made these allegations and I am convinced that it is time for a drastic overhaul of the means by which the management of Telstra operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have discovered that overtime abuse within Telstra is not uncommon and that such abuse has existed for many years, apparently with the quiet blessing of management. It is abuse which is costing Australian taxpayers millions of dollars. I have also discovered evidence of overtime rorts within Telstra and of Telstra conducting activities which are not only illegal but also are outside the gambit of the Telecommunications Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I have been able to obtain from the chief executive officer of Telstra, Mr Frank Blount, an indication that there are currently 800 employees under scrutiny for travel allowance fraud. However, of those 800 people, Telstra has managed to bring only a mere handful to court. Most of the individuals it has taken to court to date are in fact former employees who have turned whistleblowers in an attempt to highlight the abuse. They are individuals of lesser rank within the organisation, whilst those guilty at a higher level appear to have escaped unscathed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pursuit by Telstra of former employees involved in travel allowance fraud is without any particular formula or management protocol. I am aware that a particular employee was let off a fraud of over $100,000, yet others have lost their jobs over fraud involving much lesser figures. Telstra has launched Operation Echo in an attempt to resolve some of these travel allowance fraud issues. According to the response which I received in estimates, Operation Echo has cost over $250,000 since May last year, yet the amount returned to Telstra is pitiful. Much of the problem with travel allowance fraud within Telstra stems from the fact that management has failed to resolve the contentious issue with the union. In effect, Telstra management has not had the courage to confront the union and that failure to reach agreement has cost Australian phone users millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telstra has admitted, in response to my questions, that under the existing guidelines it is possible for employees to be paid travel allowance even though they may only be 1 1/2 hours away from their home. There have been instances brought to my attention where employees received travel allowance over weekends yet actually returned to their homes in Telstra vehicles over those same weekends. When we add to that rostered days off and long weekends, we can double the amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Telstra has gone so far as to admit that in its current guidelines for travel allowance purposes, there is no minimum prescribed distance. I am sure that within Telstra a culture has developed amongst employees in which travel allowance is seen as a legitimate means of increasing income. I would steadfastly argue that no employee should be out of pocket whilst undertaking duties on behalf of their employer away from home, but what we have at Telstra is a system which is open to abuse, which has been abused, which continues to be abused and which has drawn little, if any, action from the Telstra management to resolve the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that I had received evidence of overtime abuse within Telstra. In fact, I understand that a report by Detective Sergeant Doug McKinnon and Detective Sergeant Paine of the Australian Federal Police has vindicated those claims and that there has been evidence of Telstra employees receiving unjustified overtime payments, some&mdash;I repeat&mdash;whilst on sick leave or annual leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In mentioning these further abuses, I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate the case of a Mr Geoff Marr. Mr Marr is a former employee of Telstra who has been dismissed over a purported Cabcharge abuse of around $200. There are two points which need to be made at this stage. The first is that Telstra by its own admission has spent over $145,000 pursuing Mr Marr over this Cabcharge abuse of $200. The second is that these allegations of Cabcharge abuse by Telstra management against Mr Marr only came to light after Mr Marr had taken the step of informing management of his concerns regarding overtime abuse within his department. I believe that Telstra has in reality spent around $400,000 pursuing Mr Marr. I believe it has done so in an effort to silence him and to discredit him, because of his claims of management malpractices. As an example of that, under freedom of information he has obtained over 50,000 pages of documented reports that have been put together about his activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that Mr Marr is unique in that he is the only employee that Telstra has chosen to pursue, Australia-wide, for Cabcharge abuse. Yet Telstra records confirm that other employees have used Cabcharge in similar ways to Mr Marr. Those same records show that a Telstra employee, Mr Gary Ryan, and an associate caught a taxi from Melbourne to Sydney at Telstra expense in September-October 1989 because a flight was missed, in preference to attending a social function, and no action was taken. There are two standards which have been adopted by Telstra management, one which applies to employees who toe the line and another which applies to employees who are not prepared to condone abuses of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These allegations are not just my own. In fact, the national freedom of information manager for Telstra, Mr Hedges, appearing at an Administrative Appeals Tribunal hearing under oath gave sworn evidence that Mr Marr's claim of overtime rorting had been completely substantiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember that these allegations of Cabcharge abuse against Mr Marr occurred after he had alerted management to the overtime abuse. In fact, there have been serious allegations made in the Industrial Relations Commission by Commissioner Sheather that Telstra has been guilty of manipulating disciplinary tribunals in order to persecute staff. I wish to quote from the transcript of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission hearing before Commissioner Sheather in which the commissioner said:</PARA>

Further, it took Mr Tod almost nine months to change his mind regarding the validity of those documents&mdash;I guess there had been a fair amount of pressure on him to do it&mdash;which had been previously authorised.</PARA></TALK.START>

Such activities by the private investigators acting on behalf of Telstra were in direct contravention of sections 76D and 5 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914, which deals with illegally obtained confidential information. Yet Telstra not only condoned those activities, but Mr Mark Lillico Thompson, a Telstra employee, authorised payment for those illegal acts conducted on Telstra's behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that Telstra has taken any steps to inform the authorities of the illegal acts undertaken by John R.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to other enquiries as requested, we failed to ascertain most information on the grounds of the Privacy Act and our usual sources were reluctant because of the I.C.A.C. enquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>The quote clearly shows that not only did Telstra management, and in particular Mr Mark Lillico Thompson, condone these illegal acts; they in fact requested private investigators to conduct illegal acts against a former employee. I believe that the seriousness of these facts is such that they warrant a thorough and detailed investigation of the means by which Telstra operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these activities conducted by Telstra were not serious enough, then I believe we need to draw attention again to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission hearing where Mr Mark Lillico Thompson, who is Telstra's legal services officer, on page 196 of the transcript of that hearing admits that two Telstra protective services officers, Mr David Dale and Mr Leigh Rankin, had obtained copies of bank statements which were in Mr Marr's possession, In fact, Mr Lillico Thompson further admits that such documents were on the Telstra protective services file.

It is my belief and my understanding that those documents were removed from Mr Marr's briefcase, which was within his office, without his permission. I am concerned that, again, Telstra has failed to act in relation to these wrongdoings by its present employees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When questioned in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Telstra claimed that the records relating to the connection of CCAE equipment to Mr Marr's phones were conveniently destroyed. Such action is in direct contravention of Telstra's national procedures manual for call metering and charging. Part 1.8 of that manual dealing with the retention of files indicates that such files are to be kept for a minimum of three years. Yet, in the Marr case, where the files would be crucial in determining the validity or otherwise of the illegal actions undertaken by Telstra, the files have been mysteriously destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there we have it&mdash;all that fuss and bother to pursue a poor, unfortunate, well-meaning employee who has been accused of misusing a $200-odd Cabcharge docket.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the appropriation bills before the Senate today. I would like to direct my opening remarks towards Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1993-94, and the Department of Transport and Communications, particularly with regard to road transport. This appropriation bill deals with road funding, shipping, waterfront, rail and transport. In the continuation of this government's ever decreasing allocation of money to roads, the government has really gone overboard this time. When the Fraser government went out of power, some 7c per litre of the road fuel levy received was going back into roads. Approximately $1.3 billion was allocated to roads by the federal government in one financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little bit at a time this government allowed it to go to about $1.6 billion, but that was only last year with the black spot program. An extra amount was added on for that program, which I will come back to later. But generally this government did not increase road funding in real terms from the day it came to government. It was locked in for the first year of government by the budget at the time and agreements that existed with the states, but within 18 months it had gone back to cutting road funding right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the $1.3 billion continued on for some time. All this time the state of the roads was deteriorating. The black spot program was introduced by the Hawke government, I believe as a political exercise at the time. I criticised it at the time. I always maintained that the black spots on the roads were not necessarily where the high unemployment was. Mr Hawke tried to relieve high unemployment with the black spot program. Fortunately, the minister for land transport at the time, Mr Brown, turned it into a worthwhile exercise and directed funding to the black spot program where it was really needed. I commend him for his work during the time he had control of the black spot program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget, road funding has been reduced from $1.628 billion right down to $1,019.6 million in 12 months. For a  government that prides itself on increasing exports to get greater export income, this is a total disgrace. It is worse when one reads in the forward estimates that in the next budget it is going to decline further to $813 million, which means that in the space of two years road funding by the federal government will have been cut exactly in half.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one wants to see the results of the neglect of road funding in Australia one ought to get around the more remote areas of Australia.

Getting back to the subject, the more remote areas of Australia is where the main exports come from. One would know from the Mabo debate that Western Australia produces 25 per cent of export income. That export income comes from the remote areas. You cannot mine in Kings Park. Even if you wanted to you would not be allowed, not that I recommend it. You cannot mine a river. You cannot grow wheat in St George's Terrace. It has to be grown in those remote areas, that I inhabit so very often. Unfortunately, with the hours and weeks we sit in this place the time I spend there is getting less and less. Anyhow, I volunteered for that when I went for preselection in 1986. The state of our roads is deteriorating. Bitumen generally&mdash;and I have a bit of experience in road making from my local government days&mdash;lasts for 40 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it depends on the specifications. I am talking about bitumen on highways and main roads, which generally lasts about 40 years. Generally, it needs no maintenance for about 15 years. Someone will shoot me down for that statement. Of course, it depends on the amount of traffic on it and the weather. The weather has a lot to do with it, in particular rainfall. The optimum rainfall for road making, if I can remember my textbooks, is about 18 inches a year in the old terms. So, if there is a lot more or a lot less, that can affect it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a period of 40 years. For 15 years nothing needs to be done. After 15 years, it is necessary to start spending money. When a road is 15 to 25 years old, a reasonable amount of money needs to be spent on it, and after that it goes up. This is especially so on the narrower roads because there is shoulder maintenance. If the roads are wide enough, if they are the normal highway specifications, vehicles do not go off the edges and the roads do not break down. That is basically where spending starts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, a lot of the bitumen roads in Australia today are in that 25 to 40 years phase. In fact, the bulk of them would be in the 35 to 40 year stage. A lot of money will need to be spent to maintain those roads. Of course, a lot are getting to the stage where they need to have the rippers put through them and started again. For a new road, it is not only a matter of putting a new black top on it; foundations have to be laid again. According to the fourth rule in the textbooks, without new foundations corrugations will go down to the base of the road and it will have to be built again. That is where the real cost comes from. I cannot understand why this government did not increase road funding from $1.3 billion. It funded a one-off black spot program, which I understand saved a lot of lives in certain areas. Then it cut back funding by $600 million this year, with a further cutback of $200 million next year. I just cannot see how the government hopes to maintain those roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there is thinking, not so much from the government, but from the minor parties in this place, that more goods should go back on to rail. I myself am a great believer that more goods should go back to rail, but one has to be practical and sensible about this. I have said before in this place and I will say again that 70 per cent of all Australian goods have to go by road. There is not much choice about that. Seventy per cent of those goods then going by road travel less than 70 kilometres and are handled a minimum of twice. They are loaded on and loaded off. So we cannot get away from that road concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having got to that stage&mdash;and I do not think the government will argue that it is a fact that that 70 per cent of goods has to go on the roads; the minor parties argue that, but that is not the case&mdash;and having accepted that, I believe that the road funding has to be kept up. I will come to that a bit later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an increase in the fuel levy in the last budget. We debated that at the time. For a while there were a couple of amendments supported by the Greens, but then, when the crunch came, they folded. I would have forgiven the government for that sort of increase, even though it will increase the cost of exports to Australia, if an extra allocation had gone to helping to maintain roads, to keep those exports moving. But, no, the government failed completely to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the humanitarian side of things, it is no secret that the worse the roads are, the more deaths there are on the roads. It is a simple fact. There has been great progress made on extending the Hume Highway all the way from Melbourne to Sydney. It can be seen that, per kilometre travelled per vehicle, road deaths are being cut down, and it is the same in Western Australia. There is a dual carriageway out of Perth to as far as Sawyers Valley. For years and years I went up and down that road. I used to see a lot of accidents. That road is only about 45 kilometres long or thereabouts. There were a lot of fatal accidents, let alone injury causing accidents. Now, because of the dual highway, those accidents do not occur as often. If there is an accident, it is usually a one-vehicle accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Northam in Western Australia, they have been trying to build a bypass probably for the last 10 or 12 years, but funding is never forthcoming. When I was still in local government, the first time that a bypass was looked at for that place, if I can remember rightly, the cost was $6 million or $7 million. The latest quote&mdash;and there are no funds available, so it is hardly worth while considering the quote&mdash;was $30 million. That is more than half, roughly half, if I have it right, of what Western Australia has been allocated for total road funding for the year. So we have the situation that the longer those roads are left, the more dangerous they become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is another point. When the roads get into a bad condition, as I said, the numbers of road accidents build up and there are more deaths. One certain way to circumvent that is to drive a heavier or safer vehicle. I made a conscious decision last week about the four-wheel drive vehicle that I drive. I considered that I had seen too many of them in accidents, especially on rough roads. I thought it was time to get into something heavier. If I did that, there must be a lot of others, hundreds and thousands doing that. For that reason alone, the cost of safe transport in these remote areas is going up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have given road funding a good going over, but it needs a good going over because I am afraid that this government has certainly neglected it and is continuing to neglect it. I say to the government again that, out of the extra fuel tax that it has raised out of this budget, it should look, even at this stage, at allocating some more money for safer and better roads to save lives and move our exports overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are a lot of other nasties in this budget which we have debated at length already, but there is no harm in reminding the government and also reminding the minor parties which helped the government put them through. I refer, for example, to the sales tax on wine. I said at the time that I am not very interested in wine because I do not drink it, but I am certainly interested in the vine growers of Western Australia, and indeed all of Australia, who have been so badly affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the extra sales tax on cars and heavy vehicles. I said at the time that that legislation dealing with wholesale sales tax on vehicles would raise an extra billion dollars in sales tax. I think that the wine levy accounted for something like $85 million. The rest came from increased sales tax on cars and every other thing, including heavy vehicles. I said at the time that the cost of a prime mover would go up by $2,000 in the first instance and another $2,000 next year, making all transport dearer, of course, which will lead to higher costs in the inland areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, all that aside, even if the government could not afford extra funding from the fuel levy, it could have done so from the revenue from increased sales tax. I have already spoken about the big slug on leaded fuel imposed by the fuel excise. Whose fault is it that we have not got out of leaded fuel faster in Australia? When there were good, unleaded fuelled cars coming in from Japan, what did the government do? That helped the changeover to occur a lot more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Senator Button at the time insisted on putting $12,000 on to the price of an unleaded car. I understand now&mdash;do not get me to swear to this on the Bible&mdash;that the government is thinking of removing that excise. Former Senator Button has seen the folly of his ways. If we had allowed that excise to be removed, a lot more leaded fuelled cars would be off the road. But the government put a stop to that excise being removed, so it will have to take longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that all cars that use leaded fuel are driven by people on low incomes. I do not think there is any argument about that. And those people are slugged the most. There should have been other ways of helping them out. Even a bounty could have helped them out. That has been done before. Anyone as old as I am can remember when decimal currency and metric weights came in. We were given a hand to change over accounting machines and things like that; we had a subsidy. If something like that were done, it would take those cars off the road a lot quicker, but the government cut that one off. Anyhow, I could go on and on about that. But the point is that the government is going the wrong way about doing anything to help those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this side of politics attempted to move an amendment to cut that diesel fuel levy back, we had the help of the Greens for a time. Then the crunch came and they fell over, but I will not go into that. The Democrats were in it too. Senator Coulter accused us of supporting the pure greed of business for wanting to take 2c off the increased levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out at the time&mdash;and I will point it out again&mdash;road transporters have had the average cost of operating a truck increased from $1,000 to $1,200 a week. On attempting to reduce that increase, we were accused of supporting the greedy. At the time that was all the minor parties, especially the Democrats, could think of. But we were trying to help. We had the Greens' support for a while, until they folded, but we were trying to help keep costs down for those people who live in distant areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is up. I have enough material in relation to where this government has gone wrong in this legislation for three 20-minute speeches, but I will keep the rest for another time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his budget reply, quite rightly labelled this a budget of betrayal. But for older Australians the new Keating government's acts of betrayal commenced long before Treasurer Dawkins's budget night speech on 17 August 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only five days after the federal election Treasurer Dawkins announced that the government had no intention of keeping its promise to take all pensioners out of the tax system by 1995. This was the first post-election act of betrayal. Despite having reiterated the `no tax by 1995' promise in black and white in its own election policy document, the Treasurer had the gall to inform Australia's 1.5 million pensioners five days after the election that the government had sold them a lemon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that this promise was ditched by the government long before the election was called, but the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) insisted that it be included in Labor's election policy document. The Treasurer was not even aware that it had been included&mdash;this is what we have been led to believe&mdash;until it was brought to his attention by his colleagues, but when he was informed he did nothing to inform the electorate that the policy document did not represent the government's intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the Prime Minister deliberately misled the Australian public by making a promise that he had no intention of keeping, the Treasurer is as guilty of duplicity because he deliberately allowed the proliferation of this massive deception. The result was that Labor members and candidates openly campaigned on this promise, including at least one cabinet minister, Mr Crean, who actually pledged in a document which was distributed to people in his electorate that the government would remove all pensioners from the tax system by 1995. That is what they were being told in the documents that were going out right up until a week before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer announced five days after the election that this promise had been ditched, he claimed that the government would enter into consultations with a view to coming up with alternatives to the `no tax by 1995' pledge. But when I asked about this in estimates committee hearings recently, I was told that no such consultations had occurred during the six months since Mr Dawkins's statement. The government lied before the election telling people that they would be taken out of the tax system by 1995 when it had no intention of taking them out of the tax system. Then the government told them that it would have consultations with them to address this issue, and no consultations occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's post-election betrayal does not end here. The government promised during the election campaign that $100 million would be spent on buying private beds for public hospital patients. Within two months the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) had admitted that this promise would not be kept. It was also announced that the promised Commonwealth dental scheme would be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part-pensioners were also kept on tenterhooks as to whether the extension of the fringe benefits card would continue beyond June. Some faced the embarrassment of being told by local councils that they could not be given concessions due to the uncertainty over funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister then announced that the second round of the promised tax cuts would be postponed until at least 1998. They have become, I suppose, the beyond 2000 tax cuts. At the same time, pensioners and veterans were becoming more and more vocal about the government's decision to include unrealised capital gains on their share investment as income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite my private senator's bill being passed by the Senate and a Senate inquiry being set up, the government refused to budge. This forced many older people to sell valuable portfolios, many of which had been held for decades and many of which had been purchased by dint of saving. The letters from pensioners that came to me and my colleagues said things like, `We put two shillings of week away until we could afford to buy a parcel of shares. My husband and I did that and we stinted and saved to try to provide for ourselves later on down the track'. So many of them had held shares for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three weeks before the provision was due to commence and after it had sent out 100,000 forms, the government relented by restricting the income test to shares purchased after 18 August 1992. While this action reduced the number of people affected, it did not overcome the fundamentally flawed principle and left many people who had sold shares considerably worse off. At the moment, there are still up to 200,000 pensioners who are affected by the same income test on managed investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many are reporting massive reductions in pension that have left them with a totally inadequate income. In a lot of cases, the investments that have resulted in these massive reductions are now worth less than when they were purchased. So there has been no unrealised capital gain whatsoever. Many of them bought shares when the shares were on a high level; they dropped; the increase is now being treated as income and they made no real capital gain, realised or unrealised, and their pension goes down dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tragically for older Australians, budget night revealed that this was only the start. I repeat what I said on budget night:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no joy in the budget for older Australians, just more broken promises, reduced services, higher taxes and increased costs.</PARA>
<PARA>And at that stage we had heard Mr Dawkins's little revelation about pensioners being taken out of the tax system, so there was no joy at all. They had been let down straight after the election and now in the budget they found that more promises had been broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the election the Prime Minister promised that he would not increase taxes. Older people were told that there would not be one, but two across-the-board increases in wholesale sales tax which would increase the cost of many necessary household purchases. When we were looking at the impact of the changes in wholesale sales tax on various groups, as revealed by household expenditure surveys, we were very conscious of the fact that pensioners spend their incomes on a different basket of goods; in fact they spend them on many items that will now face increases in wholesale sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the compensation? There is none. They were not told before the election that the wholesale sales taxes were going to go up, and there would be no compensation to pensioners. That was really great news on budget night for the pensioners. We went out and told them the truth about what we were going to do, but they were lied to by this government. They were told `no increase in taxes'. And what do they find? They get an increase in tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also decided to increase the excise on fuel, and in particular leaded petrol. All of us in this chamber know that many older people purchase a car and look after it&mdash;polish it, treasure it, have it serviced and keep it in mint condition&mdash;because they cannot afford to upgrade to a new car. What do they have? A car that runs on leaded petrol. So who will be affected by the increase in the excise? Pensioners and older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government went to the election championing Medicare, having decided that optometrical tests could no longer be rebatable, resulting in thousands of older people paying in excess of $50 to have their eyes tested. Thankfully, the government has been forced to drop this niggardly proposal which would have adversely affected thousands of older Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many older people who do not receive the pharmaceutical benefits concession card face higher priced pharmaceuticals as a result of this budget. The seniors health card, promised during the election campaign for low income earning non-pensioner retirees, has also been postponed by three months, from April to July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dental scheme? Postponed. The seniors health card? Postponed. Before the election they were promised that they would be out of the tax system. After the election they are still in the tax system. We have seen this happen with one promise after another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One little joy that older people might have is a drink when the sun goes over the yardarm. But if the government had had its way, they would have been hit again on budget night by a 55 per cent increase in the excise on wine. So they could not even avoid an increase when having a drink to drown their sorrows because of the promises that have been broken by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these increases are inflationary. They eat and eat and eat away at the disposable incomes of older people, particularly self-funded retirees whose investment income has already been significantly eroded over the last 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How much compensation is the government providing for all these hikes in taxes and charges? In budget mark 1 the government promised a measly $100 rebate 12 months down the track for some older people. That has since increased to $150. However, it must be remembered that the rebate does not apply to pensioners; nor does it apply to older people with incomes over $20,700 a year. Of course, there is not one mention in the budget of possible alternatives to the ditched `no tax by 1995' promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tax hikes are not the only nasties for older people in the budget. During the election campaign the government was very keen to point out the extent of the real increase in home and community care funding since the program's inception in 1985. However, for the second year running, the government has reduced the real rate of growth in HACC funding. It is now down to an all-time low of six per cent. While much less than 50 per cent of the HACC target population is able to access the services, these reductions must be questioned. They also run counter to the government's stated objective of encouraging greater independence for the frail aged. Such a funding cut really makes one wonder whether this objective is dollar driven rather than care driven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of people with dementia in the community is rising rapidly, yet in this budget the government sees fit to make savings of $2.7 million to its special services program. Of even greater concern are the funding difficulties faced by voluntary organisations which are striving to cater for the needs of demented frail aged by establishing dementia-specific hostel facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would recommend that Senator Burns go to one of these facilities and see the troubles they are having in trying to deal with the difficulties of coping with dementia residents on budgets which are totally inadequate. Every one I visit tells me that its viability is threatened. It must be recognised that current funding and assessment methods do not adequately reflect the care needs of older people with dementia and that the end result is that these people end up in inappropriate forms of care, often at greater cost to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish talking about the impact of the budget on older people by referring to two budget decisions that highlight the deception and hypocrisy of this government. I turn firstly to the hypocrisy. Last year the previous Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, came out and attacked the coalition over and over again&mdash;he lambasted us&mdash;for suggesting that the age at which women receive the age pension should be increased to 65. He went right out of the tree. But in another post-election backflip, the government announced that the budget for 1995 would increase the age pension age for women to 65. He attacked us before the election, when we told the truth, and then changed it around after it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the government's deception. In the budget the government announced that the target ratio of community aged care packages, or CACPs, per thousand aged 70 and over would be increased from five to 7.5. This is what it says in the budget&mdash;but when is it going to happen? By the year 2000. And the number of funded hostel places would be reduced accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has admitted that the 7.5 is only a mid-term target that will be achieved around the turn of the century. The current number of CACPs is a mere fraction of 7.5&mdash;in fact, probably less than one per cent. However, in every piece of government literature that I have seen since the election, the false impression is given that the 7.5 places per thousand have already been achieved or will be achieved very soon. But let the public know that it is around the year 2000&mdash;another beyond 2000 promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no indication that this is only a target, and very rarely is it ever mentioned that it will be offset by a corresponding decrease in hostel places. So those opposite herald the increase to 7.5 when, really, that target will not be reached until the year 2000, and they do not tell people that that is being balanced by decreases in hostel places. It is sort of like a magician's sleight of hand, but we do not see the rabbit out of the hat until the year 2000. It is just another example of how the Labor government is willing to deceive and mislead the Australian public to meet its own political ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the issues that I have addressed tonight pertain to women as well. Senator Panizza talked about the government's not addressing road funding in this budget. The issue that women in rural areas repeatedly discuss with me is road funding. The Country Women's Association some years ago did a survey and asked women in rural areas which Commonwealth funding issue most concerned them. The answer was road funding. One might have thought education, health or many other issues, but road funding was the issue those women were concerned about. They were concerned about how the products would get from the farm gate to the distributors; they were concerned about how their kids were going to get home when they drove their cars; and they were concerned about their spouses driving into town to pick up supplies for their farms. Road funding is an issue for women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many women who are using the second car at home, which is most probably a car that requires leaded petrol, the increase in the petrol excise will have an effect. The increase in wholesale sales tax on many of the items they purchase&mdash;household goods&mdash;will affect them. The budget does nothing to address the unemployment problem for women. It also affects the pharmaceutical benefits scheme delay and the delay in the dental health program. All of those delays affect women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also of concern to the coalition that one of the Labor government's major election promises to women, namely the introduction of a home child-care allowance, would be provided 18 months after the election&mdash;again, off into the never-never. What the election was about was lies and what this budget is about is promises that go off into the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a number of issues which were canvassed during the Estimates Committee A hearing, in particular, but I will touch briefly on a number of other matters which came up in other estimates hearings I attended. I read a comment in the press, and one journalist made the point to me, that there was concern that the estimates committees were a bit of a loose cannon which should be reined in, and which concentrated on what at least one journalist described to me as trivia. I simply do not accept that the values of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the way he conducts himself are, in fact, trivia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I really wish to make is that, particularly in Estimates Committee A, a very wide range of issues was covered&mdash;issues which I think are important, and issues which to my knowledge were not closely examined or, at least, reported on by the press. I wish to draw out some of these issues in my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue which particularly concerned me&mdash;I am sure it would be of equal concern to you, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;was the tragic case of Mrs Gillespie and her two children who were kidnapped from this country. At estimates hearings there has been fairly prolonged discussion about the nature of the government's response to this tragic case and whether in fact the government could have done any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to canvass those wider issues. I happen to think the government could have done more, but the point I wish to make to the chamber this evening is that one of the issues which is of particular concern to Mrs Gillespie is her desire to meet with our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). That is not a big request, I would have thought, for any Australian, particularly an Australian who finds herself and her family swept up in these tragic events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Senator Gareth Evans a number of times during the hearings whether he would meet with Mrs Gillespie. Each time I felt that he fudged the issue and found it difficult to give me a direct answer. I think it is fairly clear from a fair reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Estimates Committee A hearing that Senator Evans in the end said that he could see no purpose in seeing Mrs Gillespie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that there are at least four reasons why Senator Evans should see Mrs Gillespie. Firstly, she is an Australian with a right to speak to her foreign minister about a matter which comes within his ambit and to explore with him any possible future options. Secondly, I believe that such a meeting would give a very strong signal to the Malaysian government and to the wider Australian community that Senator Evans takes this case particularly seriously. I think it is a great pity for that reason that no such meeting has taken place. Thirdly, a little girl who has her Australian passport has been kidnapped from this country. Fourthly, a little boy, her brother, also has been kidnapped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there were very good reasons for our foreign minister to meet with Mrs Gillespie. On each occasion that I have asked Senator Gareth Evans to meet her, he has refused. Senator Evans says that he is unhappy with some of the comments that Mrs Gillespie has made. I will not go into that matter, but let me say that however bruised the ego of Senator Evans might be, it is nothing like the pain Mrs Gillespie feels. I would urge Senator Evans to reconsider this decision he has made and to meet with Mrs Gillespie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which was extensively canvassed at the Estimates A hearings concerned the Mabo case. The committee spent some two hours on 8 November canvassing some of the problems and issues which have emerged. There were two particular issues that I sought to press Senator Evans and his advisers on which I felt were of great concern to the Australian people. The first one was what proportion of the land mass of this country, in the government's opinion, may possibly be validly claimed under native title. I think that is a very important question. Is it correct that some 40 per cent of Western Australia may be claimed? Senator Collins and Senator Tambling would certainly wish to know how much of the Northern Territory may be claimed under native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question I pressed Senator Gareth Evans on was compensation. What is the government's estimate of the compensation possibly payable under this bill and which will flow from the High Court's decision on native title? I received no answers to those fundamental questions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think a lot of work could very easily be done on this matter. Indeed, there should have been a significant number of public servants directed to work on it so that we could ascertain the effect of this bill that the government has brought into this parliament. The government was not only not interested but also refused to undertake such work. The government has a duty to the Australian people to provide them with the full facts of this case. I was concerned that no such interest was shown by Senator Evans in what I would consider to be two significant and important questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter I raised concerned the $107 million paid to the government of Nauru. I asked whether Senator Evans could supply me with the legal advice to explain why the taxpayers should have paid out what honourable senators will agree is a very significant sum. Interestingly, I received from Senator Evans the counter-memorial&mdash;the original submission that the government put to the International Court of Justice opposing Nauru's claim. The counter-memorial put a very strong case why no such compensation should be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am faced with the problem that I have the government's reasons why it should not pay the money, which seem to me to be well argued and sensible. One particular item of information which came to hand&mdash;I do not know whether you are aware of this, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;is that two-thirds of the mining took place after Nauru became independent in 1968. I understand that not one dollar of profit has been spent on the rehabilitation of the islands. As the counter-memorial said, if Australia's hands are dirty in this case, the hands of Nauru are equally dirty. It does not come with cleans hands to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have from the government the reasons why it should not pay the money. Nonetheless, I am now faced with the problem that it will not give me the reasons why it should have paid the money. I am sure Senator Carr will agree that it is an extraordinary case. Again, I press Senator Evans to supply this legal advice so that we are better able to judge whether the taxpayers' money has been responsibly spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that came up at the hearing is the fact that Australia accepts the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice without reservation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that issue in a minute. I asked Senator Evans how many countries accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice without reservation. In the last hour, Senator Evans's office supplied me with the names of the countries. Indeed, it is a lonely group of countries that are prepared to accept the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice without reservation. The UK, the US, Canada, France and Germany&mdash;in fact, most of the major countries&mdash;do not follow Australia's course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Senator Evans gave rather good reasons why one should be a little cautious, given the fact that international law seems to be highly variable in these cases and to have left Australia, despite all previous precedents, enormously exposed in the case of Nauru. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr was kind enough to raise implicitly, in a rather unpleasant manner and with overtones that I do not accept, the issue of another very dramatic step that Senator Evans, one of the leading republicans, has taken in allowing Australian human rights cases to be ultimately complained to a number of UN committees. As would you understand, Madam Acting Deputy President, this overturns the philosophy of the Australia Act, whereby the Australian government severed ties with the Privy Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, one of your former leaders, Mr Gough Whitlam, put it quite well when he said that it was not appropriate for Australians to litigate their differences before foreigners and that it was appropriate that the Australian legal system be self-contained. That is how Mr Whitlam justified the Australia Act. Frankly, I think that statement had a lot of merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five years later, the Labor government has opened up appeals to three UN committees. I do not plan to go through what I would regard as a fairly comprehensive adjournment speech given on this issue on 26 October 1993. However, the interesting thing is that, when I pressed Senator Evans as to whether he was aware of concerns which had been expressed about the functioning of these committees, I thought he seemed genuinely surprised. Indeed, I was a little surprised that some of the public servants advising him seemed to be genuinely surprised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, I do not think it is appropriate for any government to overturn the philosophy of the Australia Act. Mr Whitlam was right when he said that the Australian legal system should be self-contained. But those who accept, like the good republicans Senator Carr and Senator Collins, that Australian cases should be appealed offshore have a responsibility to make sure that these committees are appropriately structured to hear complex cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run through some of the criticisms of the UN committees. Firstly, a number of the members of the committees are not seen to be independent of their government. Some of them are employed by the governments that nominate them to the committees. Allied to that point is the fact that, frankly, many of the governments represented on these committees are not democracies. In other words, they have not reached that appropriate structure in their community which allows freedom and liberty to flourish. So we have people who are not independent being nominated by governments that are either not free or are partly free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the committees do not adopt what we regard as proper processes. In other words, people's standing before the committees is restricted. Their hearings are often held in camera and they are dependent on finance from the UN and sometimes governments. These committees are associated with a range of problems, all of which compromise their independence and mean that they do not meet proper standards of legal processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government were going to open up Australia's legal system to another plane of law, I would have thought it would have at least done its homework and made sure that these committees met the appropriate standards of independence, due process and legal process that we regard as fundamental to our legal system. Senator Evans did none of this work, and that is a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of concern is that not only are these Australian cases able to be complained to these committees, but the Australian government reports to these committees. I have made the point before that Jim Scullin, Ben Chifley, John Curtin, Robert Menzies and Billy Hughes would never have reported, particularly before the war, to, for example, the British colonial office on any matter in the way that Senator Evans and Mr Keating report to the UN. The affection that any Australian pre-war monarchist may have felt for the British empire is literally nothing compared with the adoration that Senator Evans and Mr Keating feel for the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government presented a report to the United Nations committee on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination. In this document, public servants were asked to quote evidence of an inquiry which overwhelmingly demonstrated that:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Evans shows such a fundamental lack of pride in his country, he should let his own political staff write about it.

One of those matters&mdash;on which I would have hoped to have got some support, even from Senator Carr&mdash;relates to the ABC and the need to decentralise the activities of the ABC away from Sydney. Senator Zakharov, as a Victorian, and Senator Carr, as a Victorian, could understand the great concern amongst ABC people in Melbourne&mdash;and in all other states&mdash;about the total expenditure of resources in Sydney and the control of virtually all activities of the ABC from one particular capital. </PARA>

We could have a tax regime that is competitive with the countries with whom we compete. Secondly, we should get rid of the centralised wage fixing system with all the ridiculous restrictive work practices that go with it. I have never complained in this place about wage rates. There are no problems with the wage rates in Australia particularly with the devaluation of the dollar. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that it is Wednesday night and I do not want to detain the Senate for very long. An extremely important issue which is of great concern to many people in Australia, particularly the environmental movement and many people in this place, is the protection of old growth forests, especially in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and Western Australia. Most honourable senators will be aware that there is in existence an intergovernmental agreement&mdash;an agreed forest strategy&mdash;which refers to the need to protect and review old growth forests and to protect areas of high conservation value so that they can be properly assessed and certainly not clear felled or interfered with in any way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in speaking this evening is to point out that I have received a document written by the forest ecologist in the Environmental Protection Unit in New South Wales. He points out that compartments 1375, 1380, 1381 and 1387 in the Cathcart State Forest had been set aside as compartments with special prescription qualities. They are recognised as areas of high conservation significance and they are also areas which provide a habitat link between the proposed Coolangubra and Tantawangalow national parks. Despite this recognition and despite the recommendation from the National Parks and Wildlife Service in New South Wales that this area not be touched, it certainly appears from this document that this recommendation was overridden at the ministerial level and permission for the New South Wales Forestry Commission to log these areas has been granted. I therefore seek leave to table this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The significance of the document in relation to this chamber and this parliament lies in the fact that there is this intergovernmental agreement in which the states and the Commonwealth, with the exception of Tasmania, have undertaken to defend and protect these areas, pending their complete assessment. Clearly, this document shows that in this case New South Wales has gone against its own recommended protection and the minister has actually overridden the recommendation. Consequently,  I  believe that  this  puts  the</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>federal Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, in a very strong position to invoke that agreement and to say to New South Wales, `You have broken this agreement. These areas should be protected. These very significant areas of old growth forests simply should not be logged'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of detaining the Senate this evening for an extra three or four minutes was to make that point and make yet another appeal to Minister Kelly to ensure that these very important areas are protected because once we chop down a 300- or 400-year-old tree there is no way we can put that back in less than 300 or 400 years. This is a very asymmetric decision that has been made in relation to forests. We can decide not to chop down the trees; if we want to change our minds next week or next month we can do it. Once the trees are gone, there is no way in which that sort of decision can be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal again to Minister Kelly to intervene in these areas of high conservation significance, specifically in those areas that I mentioned as having high conservation significance which were set aside by New South Wales itself as areas which should be protected. It appears that the New South Wales minister has simply overridden those decisions and given approval for the Forestry Commission to go in and clear these areas. </PARA>
