<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse the comments of Senator Collins in that respect. A claim can be made about anything. Whether it succeeds is the question. The truth of the matter is that so far as freehold title is concerned there is no question of any claim being sustainable. So far as leasehold titles are concerned, the High Court decision makes it absolutely clear, for land in respect of which valid leases have been issued in times past,  that there is no credible basis on which it could be believed other than that native title is extinguished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For claims made in respect of leasehold land where there is some reason to believe that the grant of title might conceivably have been invalid&mdash;as I said yesterday, that is only a tiny percentage of all the leasehold interests that have been granted in this country&mdash;the legislation will make it perfectly clear that the validation procedure carries with it the extinguishment of any such claim to native title. The only residual native title that will be able to be claimed in respect of land which has already been alienated in the past, whether by way of freehold or leasehold, will be in respect of leasehold interest that is vested in Aboriginal people in situations where, as has been announced, they themselves can establish a properly based claim to native title. Under those circumstances there is an option for native title to be vested in them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the context in which the question is being asked and that is my response. Only a very tiny percentage of interests have been granted in the past in respect of which an even faintly credible prima facie case could be made for a claim to be initiated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. With respect to the minister, I do not think his response answers the question. Obviously what we are talking about is the government's assessment as to whether there is a credible basis of claim. If the government is to implement new legislation to deal with native title, it would have made an assessment, one would have thought, as to what part of Australia would be potentially capable of such claim.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. My question relates to the government's budget, particularly the longer term strategy implicit in that budget. Would the minister advise what evidence there is of the priority which the international financial community accords to the government's medium term budget strategy in making its assessments of Australia's economic outlook?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2072" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="ARTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston raises a very important issue. It actually goes to something seriously pursuing Australia's national interest instead of merely trying to scaremonger about something that is fundamentally important but which is not understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I recently had a meeting with representatives of various members of the financial community, including a senior executive from a German bank. He was discussing European and international financial community reaction about investment. He said that no-one in the international financial community was talking about the investment uncertainty flowing from Mabo&mdash;after all, many European countries are having to deal with similar issues after the collapse of the Iron Curtain. However, he emphasised that the international financial community is talking about the uncertainty flowing from the obstruction in the Senate of the government's medium term deficit reduction strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An Australian bank representative at the same meeting, who had recently returned from Europe, said exactly the same&mdash;that that was the question being asked; it was not about Mabo, notwithstanding the attempt to whip up uncertainty, which the Australian people have seen through, as has the international community. The opposition continues to be irresponsible in its attitude about medium term deficit reduction strategy and tries to pretend that there is no economic downside to what it is proposing to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it very clear that this irresponsibility does matter. It matters in a way that directly affects every Australian. For example, on 8 October a representative of Moody's warned of serious consequences for the Australian dollar, interest rates and the country's credit rating if the budget impasse continues much longer.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kemp" NAMEID="WW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The dollar is rising.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. They have got faith in the government; that is true. The dollar and the stock market are rising. Those opposite used to say that when those things went down it was bad for the government; the fact that they are going up shows what positive attitudes they have towards the government. Senator Kemp is quite correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the IMF has said that it is very important that governments everywhere acknowledge that the re-emergence of large budget deficits would be a cause of great concern&mdash;I am paraphrasing there&mdash;and a failure to reduce substantially these imbalances over the medium term would likely cause renewed upward pressure on long-term interest rates, reduce capital formation and the scope for new job creation in the private sector, lower the rate of growth of potential output and income, and continue to impede the flexibility of fiscal policy in the event of adverse cyclical developments. It went on to say further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As recent experience in several countries shows, early announcement and legislation of credible medium term deficit reduction measures have immediate beneficial effects on long term interest rates and on economic confidence, even when recessionary conditions make it difficult to undertake significant deficits in the short run.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . postponing action to deal with the fiscal imbalances would continue to impede a recovery of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>I welcome the fact that the opposition recognises that the stock market, consumer confidence and the dollar are all going up. All those are significant pluses for the economy, just as it is a plus that we are growing faster than any other country in the Western world; all those things are pluses. But it is not an excuse for irresponsibility. It is not an excuse for trying to undermine the medium-term deficit reduction strategy which is fundamental to the long-term economic success of this country. The opposition's irresponsible approach puts in grave danger the job creation priorities that the medium-term deficit reduction strategy makes possible.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Following his failure to answer Senator Hill's question in relation to native title, could he tell the Senate, firstly, what are the rights attached to native title under the government's proposed legislation and, secondly, what are the special benefits and protections referred to by the Prime Minister which will be extended to native titleholders?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2073" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The characteristics of native title are those that have been spelt out in the discussion paper and in the paper that has been circulated&mdash;and there has been no suggestion of any change in that respect. The title conveys a capacity to occupy the land in question and, in other contexts, it might savour of equivalents of hunting and fishing rights and things of this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way of describing native title is to say that it is like a deck of cards, in a sense, with a number of different components in it, depending on the context. But the particular context that seems to trouble the opposition is the effectively exclusive occupancy characteristic of native title in respect of particular tracts of land. So far as that is concerned, the position is as we have described it: that native title right will have to be established through the court system. It will then have to run the gauntlet of a process in the state court and tribunal system in determining the economic uses to which the land in question, the subject of the established native title claim, can be put. Whether those uses are mining uses or other kinds of uses will be a matter for determination by the relevant state and territory tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be certain consequences that flow from particular kinds of uses being allowed for particular kinds of native title land. There will be compensation consequences in some contexts; there will be other kinds of non-monetary compensation remedies or compensation available in other contexts. It is impossible to succinctly summarise what the particular residual content of the native title will be after it has run the gauntlet of all those processes. It depends on the particular process that is adopted and the particular result of that process in the particular context.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The special benefit and protection that is essentially provided by this legislation is the recognition of the right of native people who can establish the necessary connection with the land to have this compendious concept, which I have tried to describe, of native title, which in some contexts will involve, effectively, a complete freehold enjoyment and in other contexts something less than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precise content of that title might be some sort of residual sliver of rights or, for example, perhaps some formally acknowledged recognition of what previously has been a common law right of occupancy, or a statutory reservation that has been granted to Aboriginal people in respect of some particular tract of land. It is possible in some contexts to imagine that being acknowledged now as a result of these processes as a form of native title. Beyond that, we are talking about the kind of interests that are enjoyed by ordinary non-Aboriginal people in respect of land in question given the nature of the particular interest that is involved.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is very aware, as are the Democrats&mdash;but I am sure the opposition does not share the same concern&mdash;that consumers do want simple and reliable information to identify Australian goods. That is very much our starting point. It is not an easy area to tackle. One has to work through it with the agreement of and in consultation with state governments. After review, consultation and research, the Minister for Consumer Affairs has gained cabinet endorsement for a scheme that the government believes meets these demands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is based on amending the Trade Practices Act to prescribe what terms have to be used when a good for sale in Australia makes a claim to be Australian. I do accept there is a distinction between that and the first part of Senator Lees's question. The scheme itself will provide a baseline for all such goods and relevant authorities will be able to build on it but not go below the provisions of the scheme. Food labelling is the responsibility of the National Food Authority which has recently released guidelines on the new scheme, once again, not going below it but building on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In circumstances where all major components originate in Australia and any processing has been done in Australia, the terms `product of Australia' or `produce of Australia' can be used. The term `made in Australia' can be used when some of the components have been imported but the product gained its essential character here. When the goods do not qualify for these two terms but some processing took place here, a term such as `blended' or `packed in Australia from imported goods' can be used. This is the general background and the structure of the scheme that has been adopted by the government.</PARA>

The review also set three clear policy priorities and they are: economic security for women; public and political life, the effect of those and women's relation to them; and, women and the law, particularly looking at the impact of law relating to violence against women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the heading of economic security, the principal subheadings are: employment, child care and superannuation. Superannuation, in particular, is something that many women have only just begun to get access to. It is also something that will be affected by the removal of the exemptions under the sex discrimination legislation. We want to be absolutely sure that women maximally benefit in terms of advantages and access to superannuation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we have been saying it and that is precisely why this government is where it is&mdash;because it has delivered on excellent policy and programs for women. So far there is no doubt at all that our child-care policies&mdash;to choose just one area&mdash;have been a watershed and a milestone in terms of the advantages and opportunities they have provided for women. How could the opposition not agree with that, or is it saying it does not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that the Office of the Status of Women is the area of government that has put violence against women on the political agenda. That emerged out of an initiative by minister Tate to have an inquiry into violence, although much of the work, particularly in relation to the supply of shelters for women, has been done. But the main game in terms of highlighting violence against women and taking steps to address ways in which we can prevent it has very much been sheeted home to the Office of the Status of Women in the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This review, particularly with its emphasis on refocussing on good policy advice, is just the way we need to continue to go to improve and focus that policy so as to ensure that the advantages for women to this point are not lost but built on and developed. The other thing the review highlights is new and improved ways of consulting with the women of Australia. This is spelt out in the review document. That kind of consultation with women is vital; it is the sort of information that has meant that our programs for women have been relevant and targeted to the very immediate needs of women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consultation processes replace the National Women's Consultative Council with a committee designed particularly to work with non-government organisations and the government in preparation for the very significant United Nations conference on women to be held in Beijing in 1995. We have also established a program of round table consultation with women's organisations which will occur every six months. That will make a very considerable difference in the access of those organisations immediately to me, the minister, and to other ministers in the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Prime Minister's statement made perfectly clear, there will be further discussions with the states and territories on cost sharing arrangements in all the relevant contexts in which that issue might arise. I have nothing further to add on that part of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compensation is payable, of course, in the context of where existing grants have had to be validated by the operation of statute. That validation process does not result in any liability for compensation on the part of the actual lessees; it is a matter for government to pick up the tab. What the size of that tab will be is impossible to quantify at this stage, but our expectation is that the sum will be very small for exactly the reasons that I have spelt out previously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of valid grants, which are presumed to be the overwhelming majority of those that have been made in the past, no question of compensation will arise. Extinguishment, according to the High Court judgment, has been already accomplished. It does not need a statute to do that. The only context in which the statute has bite of its own and where compensation accordingly becomes payable is where there has to be a validation process occurring in order to correct some defect that the court might find.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday at great and nauseous length&mdash;and I hope I do not need to repeat it&mdash;it is our expectation that there will only be at best, if any, a tiny minority of cases where it will be able to be established that something in the nature of validation was required because the original grant was invalid. Post-1975 it is conceivable that a grant would have been invalid because of a failure to apply the principles applicable under the Racial Discrimination Act, but even that is highly arguable. And, of course, only a very small number of relevant leasehold interests have been granted since 1975 anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Otherwise, before 1975, the argument becomes even more tenuous as to what the nature of a possible invalidation may have been. It has to be based on the existence of native title and some other law&mdash;presumably a law of fiduciary duty or something of that kind&mdash;in respect of which there is very little reason to believe that any plausible case will ever be able to be mounted. Against that background and that being the context in which compensation may be payable&mdash;although it is impossible to quantify, and will remain so in advance of the event&mdash;there is no reason whatsoever to believe that a large sum will be involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very nature of the grounds that have been mentioned here are such as to make them extremely unlikely to arise in practice. It is impossible to  quantify that. One has to satisfy a series of criteria before one can even get to first base. First of all, one obviously has to have a credible native title claim in respect of the particular land in question by a current group of Aboriginal people who can establish the necessary connection with the land. That would exclude the overwhelming majority of leasehold interests around the country from even prima facie exposure to such claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, one has to have some kind of basis for suggesting that there was some breach of duty or some other legal principle offended in conjunction with the availability of native title in order to have given rise to some invalidation. The legislation that we are proposing&mdash;both the government's and that which we are inviting the states to enact, and I am sure they will&mdash;will result immediately in the up front, here and now validation of any such potentially invalid leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of that legislation will be to remove any ground for concern so far as any individual leaseholder is concerned anywhere in the country. It is just conceivable that in some isolated cases nonetheless members of an Aboriginal group may decide that they think they have some basis on which to mount a claim. They can do that. They can make their claim in the courts. If in the extremely unlikely event&mdash;and every lawyer I have spoken to in the country takes the view that it is an extremely unlikely event&mdash;that they happen to succeed in that claim, then there would be a question, as I said earlier, of compensation arising. But again it is not something which would, in any way, affect the position of the leaseholder. It would be a matter for the government to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are trying to do, if those opposite can begin to understand the concept and the theory that lies behind this, is put to rest any fears that might conceivably exist in this respect and to cover off and give certainty to all those particular areas where nonetheless it is just possible legally that some particular claim or action might be brought. We cannot legislate against people bringing claims, but we can legislate in a way to make it absolutely clear, in accordance with accepted principles, that there will not be any adverse consequences flowing from that&mdash;either the claim being made or even in the extremely unlikely event of that claim being upheld.</PARA>

I think it is extremely unlikely and the government believes it is extremely unlikely that that situation will arise because it is to be naturally expected that states will want to legislate to remove any possible area of residual uncertainty in this respect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a whole complex of provisions in the proposed legislation, most of which were spelt out in outline and have not been changed since the original document was made public. Those provisions make very clear that, in the case of native title sought over existing areas the subject of mining operations and so on, title will be subject to all sorts of determinations and limitations that will ensure the continuity of the present operations. So far as title grants are made now in respect of land over which subsequent exploration or mining licences are sought, it will again be a matter of the relevant interests being weighed and balanced through the tribunal and court process that is being set up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, two streams of activity go on. One stream of activity is to determine the existence of the native title in the particular context, with the content of that title depending on the nature of the traditional association and all the rest of the things that have been spelt out in previous discussion papers. But the potential of other forms of economic activity nonetheless to take place, although that title has been acknowledged, will then depend on the second stream of determinations through the economic use tribunals, if I might so describe them, which will be essentially the existing mining wardens' courts in the present state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It will be the state and territory tribunals that determine the economic uses, including mining uses of all kinds, to which the particular land, the subject of native title, can be put.

It will be perfectly possible for these various interests to coexist in that sense. It is for that reason that I think one will find that the final reaction of the mining industry to this package of legislation will be quite muted, if not indeed supportive. We will have to wait and see. It is always possible for scaremongering campaigns to be mounted in that context or any other, but the government is very conscious of the need to get this balance right between the national economic interest and the Aboriginal interest.

These have included the introduction of blood alcohol limits; the compulsory wearing of seat belts and motorcycle safety helmets introduced in the early 1970s; the introduction by most states of random breath testing in the early 1980s, which I think has made a very significant contribution, particularly, to change community attitudes to drink driving; the federal government's 10-point package of road safety measures adopted by all states and territories from 1989, which introduced uniform blood alcohol concentration levels and the compulsory wearing of bicycle helmets; significant improvements in vehicle safety design encouraged by ongoing development of motor vehicle standards by the federal government; and perhaps most importantly, a marked change in community attitudes to road safety which many of the initiatives that I have just mentioned had a role in forming.</PARA>

So I think the Prime Minister's declaration of the funeral and the entombment of the unknown Australian soldier at the Australian War Memorial on 11 November as an event of national importance certainly demonstrates the government's belief that this is an event of great relevance and interest to all Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reports in substantial part are correct. The government has decided to make available a number of places under the special assistance category program as part of our humanitarian program, and to make those available for people who will be able to apply for entry to Australia from Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic point is that the government will maintain the integrity of both the immigration program and the SAC program by insisting that people who apply to come here, first, will be in Cambodia when they apply and will have been there for some 12 months before being eligible to apply under the SAC program and, secondly, will be sponsored by family or close links within Australia. In terms of those close links, the government will provide that community based organisations such as churches will be able to qualify to sponsor those people who do apply from Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program is at the moment running at some 6,300 strong; it applies in compassionate circumstances to people from a number of countries. I think the biggest intake under this program now comes from former Yugoslavia. But the Cambodian SAC recognises that the Cambodian people have suffered hardship due to the political and social turmoil over recent years, and that that hardship has denied them the educational and social development that may have enabled them to obtain the qualifications required under our family reunion program. The SAC package is a compassionate response to their plight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do stress that it is not geared solely towards those who may have been in detention for a number of years; it is a package which is made available to those in Cambodia, in compassionate circumstances, with links in Australia and for whom those links will provide settlement assistance for the first six months in terms of food, clothing and other social support assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing this particular package, the government has also kept in mind not only the need to ensure that those who come here illegally do not have the power to access avenues of staying here from within Australia&mdash;which is why we are insisting that those who do qualify under this package will have to apply from within Cambodia&mdash;but also to recognise that the SAC program has been used extensively in respect of a number of countries to provide for these compassionate circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, that program is running at 6,300 strong this financial year. The 40, 50 or so whom we expect to qualify under this program from Cambodia this financial year will come from within that 6,300. We anticipate that this number will go up to about a couple of hundred in the following financial year, but once again they will come from within the special assistance category package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding that only those who are within Cambodia can apply to come to Australia for permanent residence under this program, we should also keep in mind that already the UNHCR has supervised the resettlement of some 380,000 Cambodians back into Cambodia from border camps in places such as Thailand. The advice from the UNHCR officials is that the human rights situation within Cambodia is such that those 380,000 people who have returned are in safety and that others who return would not be imperilled because of any aspect that would make them refugees.</PARA>

<PARA>I thank the minister for the longer reply which he provided today, but I am disturbed by several matters which he raises in his answer, namely, that this waste was reported to contain: strontium, presumably strontium 90, which has a half-life of some 28 years; cobalt, presumably cobalt 60, which has a half-life of some 10 years; and caesium, presumably caesium 137, with a half-life of about 30 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all materials which are taken up by biological systems and can therefore undergo very considerable bio-concentration. Strontium, particularly, is taken up into bones and therefore can be concentrated in that form. Caesium is preferentially taken up into muscles and, of course, can be concentrated there.

The minister does not, however, indicate where the depleted uranium&mdash;the uranium 238, which had a smaller amount of uranium 235&mdash;went. I would be very pleased to hear where that went because we have subsequently learnt that the Americans, for instance, used depleted uranium in some of the shells used in the recent Iraqi war, and that has resulted in very considerable amounts of radioactive contamination in the areas of Iraq and Kuwait. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Devereux this day, relating to the Office of the Status of Women.</PARA>
<PARA>I was particularly interested to hear the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Crowley) say that the report of the Office of the Status of Women highlights the need for new and improved ways of consulting with women. The minister said this was vital. It is a pity that the minister does not recognise the need for consultation in her dealings with the women of Australia or practise what she preaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was the coalition excluded yesterday from the release of the report&mdash;a very important report in the history of the Office of the Status of Women&mdash;but so too were a number of women's groups. The minister might have used the excuse that this was a particular briefing for women's groups. However, while the press and Labor members were at the launch of the report by Mr Keating, coalition members and senators were not invited. I found that fairly perplexing and difficult to understand, given the fact that Senator Crowley has expressed to me the need for bipartisan support on many issues in the women's affairs area, and I have been cooperative with her in that regard. I hope this will be the last time that we are excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning a women's group that has played a particular part in commenting on policy rang my office and said that it had read about the report in a newspaper. My office was told that this group was concerned that it had not been invited to the release of the report on the review of the Office of the Status of Women. I call on the minister to think more carefully about involving a wider selection of women's groups in such important releases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is really nothing new in the report on the review of the Office of the Status of Women. In November 1991 the coalition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the principles currently guiding the Office of the Status of Women to ensure that the specific needs of women are incorporated into policy initiatives and programs are important, but should also be achieved within various portfolio areas. For this reason we believe that the needs of women should also be given a higher priority in the portfolio area that is responsible for the development of policy and programs.</PARA>
<PARA>We were saying that the departments ought to take a greater responsibility for policy issues relating to women. That is one of the main recommendations of the review. But we had been saying it back in November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also expresses concern about the use of the register of women. Last month, in response to some answers I received on notice about the use of the register of women by various departments, I expressed my concern about the fact that, although there were 1,000 or so women on the register, some departments&mdash;one in particular&mdash;had never used the register and some other departments totally underutilised it. So that was not new. We also found that the Department of Finance does not have the computer software to do what the APPOINT system, heralded a couple of years ago as an important development, was supposed to do. That software has never been installed in the Department of Finance. So it was not news that the APPOINT system was breaking down. As Senator Newman says, we have already asked about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only surprise&mdash;and I noted this in my press release&mdash;to me, to the women and men of Australia, I presume, and to my male colleagues is that it took $90,000 to tell us what we already knew about the Office of the Status of Women. </PARA>

Late last week my office offered Senator Patterson a comprehensive briefing of the report on the review. She actually chose not to respond and we again rang her office. So I do not believe that there is any mileage in Senator Patterson whingeing and complaining about not being offered the opportunity to hear about the review; indeed, she was offered a comprehensive briefing, as were her colleagues the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Kernot) and Senator Chamarette.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to. Senator Patterson says that somehow all women's organisations seem not to have been present. If I trawl through my notes, I will be able to find the comprehensive list of the women's organisations that were present. Amongst those present were the national women's organisations&mdash;the peak women's organisation&mdash;which have been consulting extensively with women over the years. They were all very pleased to accept the invitation to be there for this briefing yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included amongst those groups is the National Council of Women, which is an umbrella organisation for something like one million women in a number of national and state organisations across this country. The representation of the women's organisations was very extensive. Many of these people, including Senator Patterson, are people with whom the review team consulted during the preparation of its document. That is why my office offered to Senator Patterson, in appreciation of her participation and comments, a comprehensive briefing of the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a tawdry little objection by the opposition. It is small-minded. Those opposite want to make a point of some women's organisations not being properly represented. I will list some of the organisations for the record. They include the Women's Electoral Lobby; the United Nations Association of Australia Status of Women Committee; the National Older Women's Network; Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women; International Women's Development Agency; the National Foundation of Australian Women; ANESBWA, the Association of Non-English Speaking Background Women of Australia; CAPOW; Union of Australian Women; Country Women's Association; Catholic Women's League; and the YWCA. There are as many names again and I will not spend my time reading the complete list. If the opposition wants a list of the names, I will certainly provide it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite seem to say that nothing new has emerged out of this review and that they knew it all before they went into it; they feel that decisions can be made without proper analysis, review and examination. What would be the opposition's complaints if we had not done a proper review? What if we had just decided to change things and make decisions about what might be a preferred way of going? What if we had not measured the outcomes and seriously examined the structure and procedures in that office? Those opposite would be the first at estimates committees to say that we had done the job improperly. They would want to know why we had not got the data, and on what grounds we had made those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite cannot have it both ways. If they want a serious and thorough review&mdash;which we have given them, after listening to them and women's organisations&mdash;with significant recommendations going to significant prospects for improved performance, I cannot see why they would not celebrate that instead of saying, `Boring, boring. We told you so'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, the other thing that really upsets those opposite is that they are not in a position to delete the Office of the Status of Women, which is what they have gone around the country for years saying they would do. They are not in a position to delete the equal pay unit in industrial relations; they are not in a position, as government, to delete the work and family pay unit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) continues to go along with this garbage that the opposition is somehow planning to abolish the Office of the Status of Women. We heard this during the last election campaign. It was totally untrue then and it is totally untrue now. But it does not seem to matter what the truth is to this minister; she will spout the same amount of verbiage no matter what the truth is. She would do it under water or under concrete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation also is that in estimate committees in the past Senator Crowley and her predecessor have been told exactly what the deficiencies are in the Office of the Status of Women and they have been told that it badly needed improvement. I have asked questions and pointed out publicly over a long period just what the failures are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know this will surprise the minister: I welcome the review, but I have two criticisms. My first criticism is that it has taken this government so long to realise that there are no outcomes of the Office of the Status of Women to review. It is timely that there be a review of the office to make sure that in future it does a good job for the women of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that the Office of the Status of Women was singularly invisible when it came to doing something meaningful for the part-time women workers of Australia and the women who work in the home who have no access to meaningful retirement income. The opposition came up with some valuable policies for women in the retirement income area. But the Office of the Status of Women was totally silent on that issue. In any meaningful debate we have had in Australia in recent years the Office of the Status of Women has been invisible. There was clear evidence of this when Dr Anne Summers on the eve of the election suddenly tried to pull the government's failure on women's issues out of the fire for the Prime Minister as he was going to an election and she tried to show that the government had some sort of record for producing policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I object to in relation to the matter we are debating now is the rudeness and lack of courtesy shown by the government to the opposition when the entire press gallery was invited to the function yesterday and the opposition was not. The minister did not even invite the spokesperson from the opposition on the status of women. We all would like to have been invited. It seems very strange that the press gallery is invited en masse but the minister cannot even invite the opposition spokesperson on the status of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a pretty poor approach when it comes to parliamentary niceties. It is inclined to disregard the parliament when it suits it, unless it goes crawling to one or two members of the parliament when it needs a vote here and there. Otherwise the sort of&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is perfectly true, though. When did we last have a ministerial statement in this place, for example? We have the ministers of this government going outside and making their announcements to the press gallery or at some function. This is the place where over many decades ministerial statements have been made and they are not being made in here any more. Week in and week out we have no ministerial statements. They are announced somewhere else. That is just another example of how this government has no appreciation for its position as a government that should be accountable to the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may sound a piddling little thing talking about whether Senator Crowley invited the opposition to the announcement of a review of the Office of the Status of Women when she invited the whole of the press gallery. It is just symbolic of the failure of this government to deem itself accountable to the whole of this parliament. </PARA>

My office did receive two phone calls from Senator Crowley's office, one of which informed me that we could be briefed&mdash;but the briefing was offered for yesterday afternoon, when in fact the review was released at 10 a.m. That is not good enough. I put on the public record that Senator Crowley was correct in saying that she offered to have one of her staff brief us, but in the afternoon, well after the event, well after Senator Crowley had issued her press releases and well after the women who were involved had gone away.

They have provided the support, provided the information and done a lot of the very hard work that has gone into this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office has also led the way in issues such as child care and the needs of women with children. It has also played an important role in the accreditation area. It has wanted to make sure, as has the government, that child care in this country is of a standard that is suitable for all children, is of high quality and is accessible. These are the sorts of things that this office has been involved with, and for those reasons it is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have seen the Office of the Status of Women involved in the reviews that have been undertaken on the portrayal of women in the media. People would be very much aware that the portrayal of women in the media has been appalling, particularly in relation to sport. Women's sport has not been receiving the coverage that is needed and the office has been very much involved in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also undertaken, in very recent times, the review of the National Agenda for Women, a statement launched five years ago as part of our commitment to United Nations international women's programs. We have now reviewed that document and, earlier this year, a revised National Agenda for Women was published and launched. That has been a very important document because it has enabled us to review the programs that are available, accessible and suitable for women within all of the government departments. Not only have we been able to review them; we have also been able to comment on the implementation, what needs to be done and where we need to go to next. These are the sorts of things that this office has been involved with, and they are very important. These are the sorts of things that this government supports and is working very hard towards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office has also supported very strongly the breast cancer screening program. We know what importance this has to the women of Australia. This is of the utmost importance for those women who should be participating in the scheme. It is able to provide information to women on the groups that should be utilising mammography screening. This office understands the difference between mammography screening and diagnostic mammography. Many women's organisations and many women that I meet&mdash;including some members of the opposition on previous occasions&mdash;do not understand the difference between mammography screening and mammographic diagnostic procedures. It is very important that we make sure that this is known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office is ensuring that the age group of the women who enter into this screening process is widely known. It is women of 50-plus years of age who should be screened. The program will not be turning away women who are over 40, but it is important that this campaign be directed to women of the appropriate age, that is, 50-plus, post-menopausal women. It is appropriate that women realise that mammographic screening will not stop breast cancer. If they have a mammography every two years, it does not mean that they do not have to continue with breast self-examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of things are of vital importance to the breast cancer screening program. It has been the Office of the Status of Women which has been able to bring to the government its knowledge of women's health needs in this country. For that, we should recognise the contribution of this office. We recognise there have been shortcomings in this report. That will be addressed. But I think it is very important that we do not just stand back and say, `Nothing of any worth or value has come out of this office'. It has made a significant contribution to the women of this country. For that, the women of this country are very supportive and grateful. </PARA>

The important thing is what questions were asked and what answers were given. I think we have a very real problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer given by Senator Gareth Evans on that last point was very enlightening. He said that it will be decided on a case by case basis, meaning that it will be some years before many of these claims are finally determined by the courts. In the meantime, there will be all manner of claims. Whether they are serious or otherwise will not really matter to those who are subject to these claims because they will have that sword of Damocles hanging over their heads. They will be particularly anxious to try to bring certainty back into the exercise, particularly if they are conducting very substantial pastoral properties or mining activities. Therefore, they will effectively be compelled to negotiate settlements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, has nothing to do with the merits of the claims; that simply has to do with the fact that a claim has been brought.

It has no idea what it is likely to cost. It has no idea who is likely to be affected. It has no idea how long it might take for claims to be resolved. In other words, the end result will be massive uncertainty brought about quite purposefully on the government's part presumably for some political advantage. If the government were fair dinkum about this exercise it would be swamping us with facts and figures to demonstrate that these claims are very containable. Instead, all we get are throwaway lines such as, `The cost will be very small' and `There will be a minuscule number of claims'. If that is the best the government can do, it deserves to have the Australian community very concerned indeed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have been shown in this chamber today is that the opposition does not have a view on Mabo other than how it can exploit it for political purposes. That is just absolutely typical of an opposition that has thrown overboard and disposed of every item of policy since the last election. What those opposite are seeking to do with the aid of their ally, Premier Court, in Western Australia is whip up Mabo into a scare campaign. They have had only one success in the past 10 years and that was to oppose the four referendum proposals. This is an issue that the Liberal Party in particular seeks to exploit for political reasons. Yet, for all the opposition's questions today, we have not had one definitive statement on Mabo from those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill 1993 forms part of a package of seven cognate bills which are being introduced today. Taken together, these Bills will substantially increase the level of prudential protection provided to the superannuation industry, and represent a substantial strengthening of the security of superannuation savings and of the protection of the rights of superannuation fund members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills give effect to the new prudential arrangements for superannuation that were announced on behalf of the Government on 21 October 1992 in the Treasurer's statement Strengthening Super Security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is introducing this legislation in order to give added protection to superannuation savings and to promote a more efficient superannuation industry, while avoiding the imposition of unreasonable supervisory and compliance costs. The long-term benefits of these carefully balanced measures will significantly outweigh the costs of their implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill 1993 now before the Senate provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">for effective supervisory arrangements involving direct enforcement powers for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission enabling effective enforcement of the prudential requirements and obligations placed on funds and trustees;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures provided for in this Bill complement other measures being introduced today in the companion Occupational Superannuation Standards Amendment Bill 1993, Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993, Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill 1993, Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill 1993, Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill 1993 and Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill 1993 to strengthen substantially the framework of prudential supervision of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing this Bill, the provisions of the current Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987 relating to prudential compliance standards have been taken up in order to consolidate superannuation industry prudential supervision arrangements. These provisions of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act are being repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this Bill to provide added protection to superannuation savings and to promote a more efficient superannuation industry, together with the arrangements contained in the companion Bills, will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional resources needed to give effect to this package of measures have been estimated at $4.831m in 1993-94, $4.591m in 1994-95 and $4.631m in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional costs will be recovered through the superannuation supervisory levy and the imposition of a new levy on certain superannuation funds and approved deposit funds as provided in the Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Legislation Amendment Bill makes various amendments to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">modify a provision which has been used to cover productivity superannuation determinations, to reflect the fact that they are no longer "interim";</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">modify the right of appeal from Conscientious Objection Tribunals to reflect more accurately the role of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">streamline procedures covering command and discipline where forces of Australia and other countries are serving together;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enable trustees of four welfare funds to be appointed by a Minister rather than by the Governor-General;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">remove an unintended double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force allotted for warlike service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before dealing in more detail with the last two matters, which are of greater significance, I would like to make a few observations on the other amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The superannuation determination amendments are simply to ensure that there is proper authority for determinations dealing with ongoing superannuation benefits for members of the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conscientious objection amendments would modify a right of appeal. Where a Conscientious Objection Tribunal has determined an application, there is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ("AAT") then to the Federal Court. At present, the Federal Court could hear a conscientious objection appeal from the AAT on a question of law and, with the leave of the Court, on any other ground. The amendments would eliminate the right of appeal on grounds other than questions of law, to accord with current administrative law policy whereby the AAT provides final merits review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should add that, although these amendments are necessary to reflect administrative law policy, they are not expected to have any practical effect. This is because questions of conscientious objection arise only in the context of conscription, and there could be no conscription unless Australia was under direct threat of attack.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to streamline command and discipline procedures where forces of Australia and other countries serve together will avoid the requirement for a series of formal declarations where ongoing cooperation could be anticipated. A standing declaration, to cover a particular country, would invoke mutual powers of command and discipline whenever the forces of that country were serving together with ours. Of course, this facility would only be used for close allies where we could anticipate ongoing international cooperation, for example, in peacekeeping activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to enable a Minister instead of the Governor-General to appoint trustees of welfare trust funds are part of an ongoing process of relieving the Governor-General from involvement in the detail of Defence Force administration. The trusts in question administer welfare funds for each Service of the Defence Force and retirement units for ex-Air Force personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the two more significant matters in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to remove a double benefit for a small number of members of the Defence Force who have transferred to the new Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme will correct a drafting omission. The error would allow some members who elected to transfer from the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme to receive a double benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have retrospective effect to the commencement of the new Scheme on 1 October 1991, to  remove the liability for the double benefit for members who have retired since then. Recent changes to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Rules have removed the problem for affected members who retire after 21 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two groups of members eligible to receive double benefits: Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme members who had retired with a pension; and members who had separated from the Defence Force and transferred their benefits to another superannuation scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a member of either group re-entered the Defence Force and then transferred to the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme, the drafting error would allow the member to retain the benefit derived from contributions paid in the first period of service and also to be paid those contributions again with interest. The amendments would remove the entitlement to the unintended double benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43 former members are affected. They have been advised in writing that any payment of the double benefit would be recoverable but, as no additional monies have been paid to date, it is hoped to avoid the need for recovery action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a more positive note, I come to the amendments to provide a special home loans benefit for members of the Defence Force who have been allotted for warlike service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May of this year the Government agreed to a framework for conditions of service where members of the Defence Force are deployed overseas. The Government's aim is to ensure that members who are deployed overseas will be assured of consistent and timely benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important element of the agreed conditions is an enhanced home loans benefit for personnel allotted to service declared as "warlike". This benefit will apply to members involved in the recent operational service in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. The same benefit will be available for members allotted for service in any future overseas operation of a comparable nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional benefit comprises waiver of the requirement for a qualifying period of 6 years service together with an additional subsidy period ranging from 2 to 5 years, depending on the length of warlike service. For example, members who have completed operational service in Somalia will now qualify for waiver of the 6 year qualifying period and an additional subsidy period of 3 years. The maximum subsidy period is also increased from 20 to 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated, these benefits will be available also to all personnel allotted for future service declared as warlike and represent an ongoing commitment by the Government to see overseas service by Defence Force personnel appropriately recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The kinds of operation in question are an essential element of Australia's determination to play a fitting role as a good international citizen. As the burden of that role often falls on members of the Defence Force who are deployed in extremely difficult circumstances, I am sure the Senate will support the Government's measures to establish a suitable framework for the associated conditions of service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure relates to the proposal by the government in this budget to extend the fringe benefits tax to business travel. The evidence presented to the committee, which is contained in the report, clearly shows this to be a flawed proposal both in revenue terms and in equity terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report indicates, it has been very difficult for the committee to meet the terms of reference given to it by the Senate because of the indeterminate nature of this proposal, in particular, the rate which is to be struck to be regarded as a reasonable level beyond which fringe benefits tax is to apply to business travel accommodation. With that rate not having been provided to the committee, indeed, not having yet been formulated by the government, it was impossible for any accurate assessment to be made by the committee of the impact of this proposal on the tourism industry, the accommodation industry and related industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as a consequence of that the government has now withdrawn this particular part of the bill and, it is reported, will reintroduce it at a later stage. In terms of revenue, I simply say that all the evidence given before the committee indicated that, if this legislation were to be introduced, it would not raise revenue because business would ensure that whatever provisions were made for the accommodation of its employees were below the threshold. Therefore, fringe benefits tax would not result and the government would derive no revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument that has been put in favour of this proposal is that of equity&mdash;that it is an equity measure to ensure that what the government regards as unacceptably lavish standards of accommodation are not provided to business employees. In response to questions I asked of all witnesses before the committee&mdash;those from the accommodation and tourism sector, or the business sector generally, as well as the government representatives, the officials of Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;they could not provide any evidence at all that businesses, in arrangement with their employees, provide a higher or more lavish standard of accommodation when those employees are required to travel on business activities in return for a lower salary. In other words, no evidence could be put forward to the committee that employees are substituting lavish accommodation arrangements for salary and thereby avoiding legitimate income tax on their salary. That is the first point to be made with regard to the equity argument&mdash;that there is no evidence of inequity in the current arrangements because no evidence could be provided that tax is being avoided through this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second argument in favour of equity put to the committee by the government representatives related to personal benefit&mdash;that, in their view, some personal benefit was derived by business employees when they travelled by staying in accommodation of standards above a prescribed level. I asked those representatives how that level of personal benefit could be measured, particularly in comparison with the situation of an employee who was not required to travel and was therefore able to remain in the comfort and familiar surroundings of his or her home. I asked how it was possible to assess the measure of personal benefit between one being accommodated at a certain level of accommodation when being required to travel away from home on business and being able to stay in one's own home. The response was that this was a subjective judgment. In other words, there is no objective basis on which this so-called personal benefit, which the government alleges is derived by certain business employees when required to travel, can be assessed. Therefore, on both aspects of the equity argument raised by the government, there is no case for this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report, which was prepared by my colleagues Senators Gibson and Macdonald along with me, highlights this as one of the obvious shortcomings in the government's arguments for this legislation. We also include in that minority report a number of other reservations that we have about this proposal which have arisen as a direct result of the evidence presented to the committee hearings. Therefore, we certainly welcome the fact that the government has now withdrawn this particular proposal from the tax bill within which it was included. That tax bill will proceed with other measures, but with this particular proposal to extend the fringe benefits tax withdrawn from it. It was suggested to us that this bill will return as a separate bill in the future when the government has undertaken further consultation with the industry and also has provided a discussion paper for the industry and, indeed, for us as members of the committee to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might suggest to the government that it let this particular proposal disappear without trace. If it does reappear as a separate piece of legislation, that legislation should be subjected to the very closest scrutiny, as we have recommended in our minority report, to determine its impact on the industry and, of course, its equity circumstances. As I have said, in the evidence provided to this committee thus far, there is no justification for this proposal either on equity or on revenue grounds. That is why we have put forward this minority report which, while accepting the recommendations and conclusions reached by the majority of the committee, adds to it our particular concerns and our severe reservations about, and indeed opposition to, this proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address briefly the government's provisions to impose threshold levels on excess travel costs which were, until the government's decision to withdraw them, part of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's effort is rather a sad and sorry saga. While the objective&mdash;to ensure that the potential for any rorts in this area was excluded&mdash;was generally agreed, the government was not able to provide sufficient information to the committee or at any other stage to show that it had given adequate consideration to the effect of the proposed provisions on investment and employment in the accommodation and hospitality industries; nor, indeed, was it able to show that the objective would actually be achieved, or the extent to which it could be achieved, if such rorts in fact existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is clear that the government had some anecdotal evidence and, clearly, there is an issue of equity involved in terms of the taxpayer subsidising benefits which may be granted to an employee by the employer&mdash;or, in the case of a self-employed person, in terms of expending what one could term `excessive amounts' on travel&mdash;the government has not been able to substantiate these arguments. To me, how the government proposes to address the reduction in investment and employment in the industry remains a very important question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had some evidence that when the tax deductibility of business lunches&mdash;as it was colloquially known&mdash;was withdrawn, turnover in the restaurant industry, which was catering for that trade, fell by 50 per cent; it recovered later to show a continuing reduction of 20 per cent. But here we have had no such assessments or no such figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is an additional difficulty in this particular proposal and the way the government went about it. The Senate was asked to approve the enabling legislation, leaving the actual threshold levels to be determined later by regulation. Clearly, that would have left the Senate in the position where disallowing the regulations was the only remedy, with a resulting uncertainty in the industry. But, to top it, the government expected the Senate to proceed to make that decision to pass the enabling legislation without providing the discussion paper which it is compiling on the basis of its consultations with the industry to determine what in fact would be a reasonable threshold level. I believe that such procedure is really quite unheard of. Obviously, the Democrats welcome the government decision, which we asked for, to withdraw these provisions relating to FBT on excess travel from the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 and to reintroduce them in a separate bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my dissenting report, I make the point that I am calling on the government to include the threshold levels which it wishes to introduce as part of that legislation and not expect the Senate to give it carte blanche to introduce them by regulation later. However, it is to be expected that, no matter where the threshold levels are placed, some reduction in turnover for the Australian tourism, travel and hospitality industries will result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore the second recommendation in my dissenting report is that the government include a provision in that legislation to remove tax deductibility for conventions held abroad by Australian companies. It is ludicrous that it is now possible for a professional or commercial organisation which is composed solely of Australian members to hold a convention or conference in Bali or Fiji, to spend Australian dollars in those places, supporting that nation's tourism and hospitality industries, and then to come back to Australia and ask for a tax deduction for the amounts expended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that in this situation our industries need not only certainty&mdash;and we have asked for that in the legislation that is to be introduced; legislation which we will be able to scrutinise and, if necessary, amend&mdash;but also some tangible support. I believe that by removing the tax deductibility in this circumstance we would be providing that tangible support and encouraging Australian organisations to hold their conventions within Australia rather than take them to other countries in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not resile from the need to find some appropriate measures to ensure that the potential for travel rorts of the kind that were claimed to be taking place is excluded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure concerns one of the pieces of budget legislation which, like much else in the budget, was ill-conceived and originated for all the wrong reasons. I think former Labor minister John Brown was correct when he said that this legislation was driven by the ideology of the Left, that the Labor Party had reverted to class envy of the worst kind for which it used to be known and which in more recent years, as a result of maturity, it had overthrown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that this legislation, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, came about because the government was embarrassed by having slugged the poor, so to speak, with fuel tax and sales tax. It was a sop to the left wing element of the Labor Party, to the unions and to the social welfare groups. It appears&mdash;and John Brown gives credence to this&mdash;that the government said, `Oh, yes, but we're gonna get the rich businessmen too'. This piece of legislation was brought in on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became fairly clear during the inquiry that the government had neither considered fully all aspects of this legislation nor done any work on what the legislation might impose. I suppose the thought of getting at the rich businessmen appeals to most Australians. It became obvious that this legislation did not do that. But it would cost jobs. It was estimated that between 10,000 and 20,000 young Australians would be thrown out of work as a result of this piece of ill-conceived legislation. It was also shown that, far from being a budget measure that raised $60 million, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) adverted to in his budget speech, it would end up costing the federal government something of that order, if not more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs to industry of compliance would have been quite horrendous. Investment in the hotel and tourism industries, which we desperately need now, would have been stifled. There would have been difficulties in respect of investment in these industries, particularly at a time when Australia needs to expand in these areas. The hotel and tourism industries are two of the small number of remaining Australian industries that have anything going for them. They are two of the small number of industries in Australia that have been able to overcome the recession planned by the Labor Party. The tourism industry and the hotel and accommodation convention industry have been able to get ahead largely on the backs of overseas tourists and conventioneers who come to our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, which was introduced without any thought by the government, is simply a sop to the left of the Labor Party. The industry became concerned immediately after it had worked through what the effects of the legislation would be. As a result, it raised this issue. The Liberal and National parties were concerned about the issue because we felt that sufficient thought had not gone into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, on budget night we assumed that the government had looked seriously at and done some work on this legislation. That is what we expected, quite reasonably, on budget night. As it became very clear very quickly that that was not the case, the Liberal and National parties sought to refer this matter to a Senate committee. That is what happened, and the result is the report we are discussing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give credit to the committee, particularly its chairman, Senator Childs, who conducted the inquiry very fairly. I think the committee came to a very sensible decision in its report. As Senator Spindler has said, it became clear to all of us on the committee that we were being asked to report on certain aspects of the bill when the government really did not have any detail on which we could work. It was indicated on budget night that the allowance would be somehow related to the Public Service allowance, and so the industry used that as the benchmark for some calculations. Just as we started on this inquiry, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said, `Oh, well, I'm taking that back. We're not going to use that anymore'. So we did not quite know where we were or what was to be proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Senate was being asked to do was pass legislation that had no detail at all&mdash;the government would come along in two or three months time and introduce some regulations that had not been initially before this chamber; regulations which could impose taxes on the tourism and hospitality industries. Initially, the Liberal members of that committee certainly could not answer questions that were asked simply because the government did not have any details. The government had not done any work on the legislation and did not know what it was all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became clear from the evidence that the measure was certainly not a revenue measure. When Senator McMullan appeared before the committee, he tried to pretend or kid us that the legislation had revenue considerations and that there was big money involved. We got the old Labor Party line of `You're being irresponsible; you're holding up the budget; you're not going to give us all this money we need to pay for tax cuts'. That was the standard Senator McMullan line. But what he was saying in the committee hearing had been previously contradicted by the Assistant Treasurer who, in a letter, said, `This measure is not driven by revenue considerations'. By the end of the day, I do not think anybody believed there was any revenue in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard different evidence which could reasonably have led the committee to resolve&mdash;some members may not have come to this conclusion, but the evidence was certainly before us&mdash;that a large number of jobs would have been lost in Australia. In the end, no-one even pretended that there were any revenue considerations in the legislation. The compliance costs could have been quite substantial. I think there was a fairly clear indication that investment in the hotel industry&mdash;much-needed investment, particularly in the run-up to the Olympic Games&mdash;would have been dealt quite a severe blow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also became quite obvious to the committee that there had been no consultation between the government and the industry about how these quite horrific or quite substantial measures may have affected the industry. It also seemed from evidence&mdash;although Senator McMullan wiggled around the answer&mdash;that even the tourism minister was not drawn into the Treasurer's confidence when these measures were being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal members on the committee were concerned about any excesses that there might be in business travel. Nobody could give us any examples of it. People used to say, `Yes, it is there'. No-one from the industry, no-one from Treasury and no-one from the Taxation Office could give us any evidence about it. One of the witnesses to the inquiry listed a series of five possible rorts and suggested that there were other ways of overcoming those rorts. Curiously, when the Taxation Office responded to that submission, it said, `You do not need new legislation to get at those rorts because we already have legislation under the existing tax acts to attack those sorts of rorts'. If we do not need new legislation, if we have it currently, why do we need this legislation to try to overcome those rorts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and my coalition colleagues on the committee agree with Senator Spindler that, if in the future any legislation is to come before the parliament regarding this sort of thing, it should be detailed legislation. The government should not bring it in here and say to the Senate, `You approve this in broad principle. We will not tell you what it is about. We will not give you the opportunity to investigate whether it will cost jobs, whether it will raise revenue, or whether it will cost a lot to comply with. You just approve it in principle. We will go away and do the regulations, work out the formulas and we will introduce them behind the closed door by regulation'. That is not good enough. We on this side agree with Senator Spindler&mdash;or he probably agrees with us, and it is part of the minority report that we have put in&mdash;that any further proposals should be contained entirely in the legislation and not be left to be implemented by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our dissenting report&mdash;although it is better to say the additional conclusions in the general report, because we do agree with the majority conclusions of the report&mdash;we thought it appropriate to make two additional recommendations, one of which I have just mentioned. The other one indicated that, from what we gathered from all the evidence given to us, no case had been made out for this legislation at all. We were very doubtful that there was a need for this type of legislation. So we have additionally recommended to the Senate that if legislation regarding the so-called excess business travel expenditures is again brought before the Senate, it should be subjected by this Senate to the most intense scrutiny to establish: firstly, the need; secondly, the purpose; and, thirdly, the effect of that legislation. Whilst it has been put in other words, all members of the committee&mdash;Labor members, Democrat members and certainly the Liberal members&mdash;agree that if this legislation were to come before us again, it should be subjected to the most intense scrutiny by this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we in the Liberal and National parties have not had any time to seriously consider the second recommendation proposed by Senator Spindler, it would seem at first glance that it is not something that we could support. It is building up the tariff walls again, saying that any Australian conventioneers who go overseas will be penalised in a tax way if that happens. I think Senator Burns quite rightly pointed out that, if we start doing that, we will certainly get into a trade war with our trading partners and it would not be very long before all the Americans and Japanese and Asians who came to Australia for conventions would be subjected to tax penalties in their own countries for coming here. I really do not want to get involved in that; I suggest to Senator Spindler that he would have a lot of convincing to do if he wanted us to agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this matter has been left, the Assistant Treasurer&mdash;who seems to be in charge of all of this&mdash;is indicating that he will talk further with the industry. The Assistant Treasurer somewhat belatedly&mdash;nevertheless it is welcome&mdash;instituted some sort of dialogue with the industry and has called for and received submissions. It is the Assistant Treasurer's intention, as I understand it, to publish a discussion paper which he will then make available to members of the committee and to the Senate so the matter can be further considered. I certainly hope that the Assistant Treasurer will come to the conclusion rapidly, if he has not done so already several weeks ago. I suspect that is what it is all about; I think he realised a couple of weeks ago that this was all wrong and that what he needed to do was to try to extricate himself and the government as best and as quickly as he could. If he has not come to that conclusion, I am quite sure that, by the end of this consultation period, he will have come to that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that the government would think very seriously and very long about whether there is really any necessity to do this. If there are a couple of perceived rorts, then I think we have been told quite clearly that there are other ways of attacking it. It does not raise revenue. It could affect jobs. So why bother with it? I just hope this is another one of those pieces of legislation in this 1993 budget that will be thrown onto the ever growing discard pile. I think in this instance that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I magnanimously say to the Assistant Treasurer and to the  government that they do deserve at least some congratulation for realising when things need to be done away with; when they have got out of their depth they have been prepared to pull out. I hope they maintain that mature approach and that this is the last we see of this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to continue debate on the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 which concern the proposed increase in levy on fuels. As I said last night, I am very concerned about what this measure and other measures in the budget are doing to the investment climate here in Australia. Why is this important? It is only through investment that we are going to grow jobs in this economy. Unless we have an attractive investment climate, unemployment will not go down, and that is what we need to fix.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night I made mention of the fact that virtually all the OECD countries are doing three things: they are containing their budget deficits; they are increasing savings; and they are deregulating their labour markets. What are we doing? We are heading in the reverse direction. With regard to the labour market, it is obvious that the government has given in to the ACTU on genuine enterprise agreements concerning non-union labour. It is now threatening to give in with regard to secondary boycotts, which is going in the reverse direction to that of the rest of the world. Those measures are sure to guarantee double digit unemployment in this country for quite a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the June quarter of this year national savings fell by 1.2 per cent of GDP&mdash;about $1.2 billion. This was the largest single quarterly fall since 1974. National savings fell by $3.2 billion last financial year. The main culprit is the federal government. As the FitzGerald report aptly pointed out, the government's deficits are the main problem with regard to savings in Australia. Here we have a government saying that its budget is about jobs but its policies are heading in the reverse direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment in Australia is in crisis. Investment in plant and equipment in Australia for the last two financial years has been less than six per cent of GDP&mdash;the lowest level since World War II. The level should be around eight to 10 per cent. That needs encouragement. We should compare this with our competitive country just across the Tasman&mdash;New Zealand&mdash;where unemployment is now below 10 per cent, capital expenditure is expanding quite substantially and the budget deficit and the current account deficit are close to balance. It is not hard to see that the New Zealand dollar will be equivalent to the Australian dollar in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should we be doing? We should be lowering costs and increasing savings. We need to free up the labour market and lower costs in the transport industry. What are we doing in the transport industry? The increase in levies proposed in these two bills will increase transport costs substantially. The fuel levy will increase shipping costs. I will not go into the details, which my colleagues went over yesterday, but we are well aware that shipping costs will go up substantially. The estimates are that shipping costs around the coast will increase by 2.1 per cent&mdash;$360,000 per ship. It is a very important matter to my home state of Tasmania. It means that all goods in Tasmania will go up in price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other transport costs for road and rail will also go up very substantially. The industry estimates that this fuel levy will increase road costs by three per cent across the nation. With our road and rail transport costs being so important in our huge nation, the cost of everything will go up. In addition, we will have an increased levy on fuel oil. Last night my colleague Senator Parer mentioned two mines in detail&mdash;Savage River, in my home state of Tasmania, and the Nabalco alumina refinery at Gove in northern Australia. Without going into the details, the problems at Savage River are serious. The excise will increase the cost of product by $1.15 per tonne when the value of the product is $36.60 per tonne. That will be a quite substantial increase in the cost of the product. Management has no doubt that this matter could easily cause the early closure of the mine. The feasibility study for taking the mine underground is certainly at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In northern Australia we have the extraordinary example of the Nabalco alumina refinery. In one fell swoop, its costs are expected to rise by $25 million per year. We might think that Nabalco does not matter as it is just a foreign owned enterprise. That is not true. Whilst 70 per cent of it is owned by Swiss Aluminium Australia Ltd and basically managed by that company, CSR owns about 20 per cent and the AMP Society, superannuation funds and similar groups own a further 10 per cent. It is one of 32 alumina refineries in the world, but unfortunately its energy costs are the fourth highest in the world. Here we have a government, without even conferring with it, putting a $25 million cost impost on that enterprise. Those are some excellent examples of the government, without really thinking about what it was doing, imposing substantial costs on business and providing a further deterrent to investment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we increase savings? As the FitzGerald report pointed out quite clearly, the federal government is the main culprit for decreasing savings. We applaud the government's aim to chase a one per cent deficit by 1995-96 but it ought to be chasing a surplus by then because that is what is really required to return Australia to a position where it is making savings. We cannot go on accumulating debt. We have to increase savings in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not taking this matter seriously enough. The investment climate here is extremely bad. Not many Australians really understand that investment is now a global business. Investment does not have to take place here in Australia. Neither Australian savings nor foreigners' savings have to be invested here. One interesting statistic I came across a while ago showed that over 50 per cent of Australian money put into trust funds of various sorts during the last quarter&mdash;the quarter ended 30 June&mdash;went off-shore. The AMP Society&mdash;the largest investor in Australia&mdash;is saying publicly that its policy is to put 25 per cent of its funds off-shore. Why? Because it does not have the confidence to invest here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investors have to be persuaded&mdash;we are not talking about just big projects but small projects as well&mdash;that it is worth while to invest here in Australia. Until that happens, there will be no decrease in unemployment and no optimistic future for our children. Instead of imposing this additional cost on fuel, the government must cut its costs. We are expected to approve a levy on fuel which puts up all business costs across the nation when the government puts up its own expenditure by 3.9 per cent in real terms this year, on top of increases of 5.3 per cent and 5.5 per cent for the last two years. So we have seen a 15 per cent increase in real costs for the Commonwealth government over the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the real world, any managing director who could not cut costs by 10 per cent would be sacked. That is what has been going on right across the board if we take note of what has been happening in the private sector in Australia. Firms have been achieving that and much higher rates of cost reduction in order to survive against the harsh competitive world. Yet the Commonwealth government seems to be insulated from all of this. Even state governments are meeting those targets and reducing their costs substantially. So why is the government imposing taxes when we really should be tackling cost reduction within the Commonwealth government? That is the issue, and I support the Opposition's case against these bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak against the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. In doing so, I am reminded of the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on budget night some two months ago which he started off by saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. Too many are now out of work. Too many have been out of work for too long.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a lot of ordinary Australians who wish he had stopped his budget speech right then because they were the only real facts in the whole of those 14 pages. From then on there was far less of an element of truth in what he said. In the very next sentence he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary objective of this budget is jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>I fail to see how a budget can have a primary objective of jobs when one of the most cruel measures in that budget is to increase costs by way of a fuel tax to all those ordinary Australians who are forced, by one means or another, to consume fuel in their daily living or business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fuel excise is a hidden consumption tax. The Treasurer made great play on the night of the budget of saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will meet its announced objectives without the introduction of a massive new indirect tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The only truth in that statement is that it is not a new tax. He has made sure that we have a massive indirect tax that impacts unfairly on people in Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will maintain indirect tax exemptions for the necessities of life as traditionally recognised in the Australian tax system.</PARA>

<PARA>We have heard over and over again from the government, particularly from those who answer questions about the rise in fuel taxes, that we have the third lowest petrol price in the industrialised world and one of the lowest fuel taxes.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at no time have members on the government side indicated that we also happen to live in a country that has some of the vastest distances that it is possible to cover in pursuit of a living or by way of transporting goods and services to the people throughout Australia. A fuel tax, and the imposition of an increase in it, is an increased tax on every single good and service. Every good and service will be affected to a greater or lesser extent by the increase in the fuel tax. Because of our heavy reliance on road and rail transportation, the cost of the extra tax on fuel will be added to everything we buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that the fuel excise impacts disproportionately on people who live outside metropolitan areas. I recently conducted a survey amongst South Australian Farmers' Federation branch presidents and secretaries. I asked them to rate their level of concern in some 24 different categories of government policy which are influencing them. Honourable senators would not believe it, but what came out on top as the major concern to people who live outside the metropolitan area and to these secretaries was fuel tax&mdash;and that was prior to the introduction of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as fuel tax, there were concerns about commodity prices, the wool crisis, European Community and United States subsidies, stamp duty and the cost of tertiary education, but it is a fact that the major area of concern to them was the effects of a fuel tax and, certainly by now, the increase in the fuel tax. Of over 80 per cent of the farmers' federation presidents and secretaries, the major concern from all those 24 categories is the cost of fuel and the impact of the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, 100 per cent of those surveyed from the very northern areas of the state, and 97 per cent from the Eyre Peninsula, rated a fuel tax as their highest priority. That is not hard to understand when one considers the vast distances that these people have to transport themselves, their goods and anything that needs to be supplied to run their businesses. </PARA>

This topic came up for discussion in the estimates on 26 August when both Senator Ian Macdonald and I questioned Senator Schacht, who was representing the Minister for Tourism, and the departmental officers about the impact of the fuel excise increase on regional tourism. At that committee hearing, Senator Schacht agreed that about 80 per cent of Australian tourists travel around Australia by motor vehicle and that the increase in petrol tax will increase the costs of people travelling to rural and regional Australia. But we were unable to elicit from Senator Schacht whether the Department of Tourism had done any work prior to the budget on just how fuel tax increases will impact on tourism in regional Australia. </PARA>

The one thing that they did not mention, and it has been admitted by government ministers, is that the use of a fuel tax is entirely a revenue raiser. I do not know why they do not admit that it is a revenue raiser. It has nothing to do with lead in the environment and it has nothing to do with making sure that the money raised by the increase in the fuel tax is used for improving the environment.

That legislation was knocked out because it was considered that it would have too big an impact on the car industry. Now we have the situation where the government is thinking about reconsidering its position&mdash;or so we have heard&mdash;on the importation of second-hand cars which use lead free petrol. Senator Margetts need not be concerned about old cars being dumped in Australia. If cars do come here they are going to be five years old or less and will use unleaded petrol. </PARA>

These people have to use fuel in their farming enterprises and in every aspect of the running of their businesses.

I support the contributions of all opposition speakers with regard to the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. Both bills increase the tax payable on petroleum products and propose further increases to tax on those products to take effect in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory notes indicate that these bills will result in the cost of leaded petrol increasing by 3c per litre from 18 August and a further 2c on top of that from February 1994 and again in August 1994. The cost of unleaded petrol will rise 3c per litre from 18 August and thereafter by 1c in February and August 1994. That will be the effect of these bills should they be passed this afternoon. The bills are the most significant and controversial part of the budget, as I mentioned before. As Senator Ferguson mentioned, they are nothing more than a fundraising exercise by the government. They do nothing more than fund the government's already bloated spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government sought economic credibility, during the election and since, with a plan to reduce the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP before 1996. It has now revised that figure to 1.3 per cent of GDP before 1996. The parliament and the markets await the next revision of that budget plan before the next budget in June. A revision will surely come, as the cornerstone of the government's so-called plan is based on the very spurious figures delivered by Treasury, yet again, regarding world economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In truth, world economic growth will not be achieved. One of our major trading partners, Japan, forecasts zero GDP growth this financial year and in the coming years. Western European countries continue to flounder below our budget forecast of 2.5 per cent growth in GDP. If the whole budget strategy is based on recovery in the world recession, then the budget was a failure the very night it was brought down. The bills before the Senate seem to have created pain for no gain at all and, as far as the government deficit reduction plan is concerned, this budget amounts to nought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural sector has had to take the brunt of just about every single budget&mdash;at least every budget in the last three years, during the recessionary times&mdash;that this government has handed down. It should be remembered that in the past decade the Australian rural sector has never really taken in the effects of those boom conditions that the stock market, the entrepreneurs, the manufacturers and the mining sector have all enjoyed. Any price rises that occurred in commodities for those brief moments in 1988-89 were never passed down to the farm gate. Much of the profit was simply taken by the middlemen, the agents, the abattoir workers, the transporters or the exporters. But I stress that it never reached the farm gate. Because of this, there really is great social tension in rural Australia today. Rural Australia wants to know why it has to take another massive rise in petrol at a time when household incomes are at poverty levels and at a time when the export prices for commodities have collapsed to their lowest levels in a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the Commonwealth Bank's commodity price index, which has plunged by some 4.2 per cent in the last month. This is the lowest level on record, below the trough reached at the depths of the 1986 banana republic currency crisis. This is despite the value of Australian mineral exports increasing by five per cent. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics reveals that it is only the tumbling Australian dollar which has been cushioning the blow to the national income of sliding commodity prices and weak world demand. The rural sector, quite frankly, is being trashed. The anger about the deals done between the government and the Democrats with respect to petrol can be compared with the anger that the Italians showed towards Mussolini and his mistress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is fast becoming a north and south divide in this country, as there was in America. The rural sector of Australia has become very much the defeated and the exploited south, with its carpetbaggers and all. The government continues to drive old Dixie down. I ask honourable senators to consider these figures: the latest DEET figures show that in my state of Victoria unemployment has doubled in some of the main regional cities. In Ballarat it is 18 per cent; in Mildura it is 18 per cent; in Maryborough it is 22 per cent; and in Morwell it is 16 per cent. The city of Melbourne has plateaued at a state average of around 12 per cent while rural unemployment continues to rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, in my state of Victoria, the average rural income for a family&mdash;not a single income&mdash;is $28,000, and one should bear in mind the very high costs of living in the country areas. In the city of Melbourne, it is $40,000 and in the city of Canberra it happens to be $50,000. At the lower end of the scale in rural Victoria, those who earn less than $16,000 make up 23 per cent, while in Melbourne it is 12 per cent. At the higher end of the scale, families in rural Victoria with incomes above $60,000 make up nine per cent. In Melbourne it is 21 per cent. So the gulf between income and employment is greater than it really should be. A gulf really has opened up. As I said before, we are becoming a north and south divide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference in the cost of fuel, leaded or unleaded, between country and city before this extra impost was already around 20c a litre. This new tax, as described in the explanatory memorandum, will place it well and truly above that 20c per litre difference between city and country. The effects of this have been well described by my colleagues in the chamber this evening and yesterday. They included an added $20 million to farm costs, an extra $9.1 million to the operating costs of rail authorities and an extra $3 to the average weekly shopping basket of $70. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that these price increases will cause a disaster in the rural sector and will affect the rural sector much more than metropolitan areas. If these prices continue to rise in the country and if fuel and transport costs continue to rise, I wonder if it is not a good idea to take up the Industry Commission's recommendation and introduce a toll system. It does sound, at first blush, very unpalatable, but if it means relief from excise tax for rural people, then the day for consideration is drawing very close indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We are fed up with reading about harbour tunnels in Sydney, ring roads in Melbourne, underpasses, overpasses and cross-passes in our major cities, while potholes and dirt roads are the order of the day in rural Australia. The National Road Transport Commission has reported that non-metropolitan areas account for some 40 per cent of Victoria's petrol prices. Despite being major players in the market, rural communities and businesses receive no discounts and even pay freight costs which come free of charge to city customers. At times of heavy discounting in metropolitan areas, the price gap in the country has been larger still. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government simply uses excise tax to raise revenue, the oil companies are also guilty of using high fuel prices against rural communities, businesses and farmers to subsidise their price wars in the city. The most effective way to restore fair petrol pricing between country and metropolitan areas would be to introduce a uniform terminal gate price. Certainly such an idea is worth looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terminal gate price system, as recommended by the Victorian state government rural committee, oil companies would be required to sell petrol at uniform prices. The only difference between rural petrol prices and metropolitan petrol prices would be the transport costs&mdash;that is fair enough&mdash;not the added cost that usually goes on to the rural petrol pumps to pay for the discounting that savages the city. Any discounting in the city would be passed on to the country with only the transport costs added. Where there is a discount in the city, there would be a discount in the country. That is fair. This is a worthy policy to consider in order to restore equity in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month's budget has struck at the heart of rural Australia. It has placed another hurdle in the path of rural people as they struggle to survive. For the government speakers in this debate, the increase in petrol, diesel and other fuel prices was simply a revenue raiser and nothing more. The pathetic attempt to sell increases in fuel taxes for environmental or health reasons cannot be taken seriously. I think Senator Coulter would be the only one who takes that seriously. Certainly for the rural sector these taxes have presented another unanticipated blow to their livelihood. </PARA>

These have included losses of $62,000 for all broadacre farmers; losses of $18,000 for those with wheat and other crops; losses of $51,000 for mixed farmers; an incredible loss of $107,000 for specialist wool producers; losses of $43,000 for beef growers; and losses of $68,000 for cattle and sheep producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In industries which are heavily dependent on transport the effects will be even more pronounced. The support we received from farmers and farm organisations when they understood the fuel cost savings under Fightback showed the importance of fuel to the farm sector. Under Fightback the transport sector alone would have reaped savings of just over $2 billion a year, and these were official Treasury figures. The fuel tax rise, coupled with the $600 million cut in road funding, is a double whammy for country people. The slashing of road funding means that the black spot program, which was a major contributor to road safety and employment in country areas, was not renewed. This is nothing short of irresponsible. This is politically and morally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics from the Federal Office of Road Safety indicate that for every $44 million of road funding one life has been saved. With this savage increase in fuel tax, accompanied by cuts in road funding, the family motorist will suffer&mdash;the low income family motorist worst of all&mdash;while the government allows the road that they travel on to fall further into disrepair. Under this government the petrol bowser has become an intrinsic part of funding its unrealistic policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to a question from me recently, Senator Collins admitted that when the government came to power in 1983 over $6.50 out of every $10 raised through fuel tax was spent on Commonwealth road funding. The budget papers now reveal that by 1994-95 this will have fallen to $1 out of every $10 raised. I am sure the electorates in country and coastal New South Wales would like to know that&mdash;the electors in Richmond, Page, Calare, New England, Hunter and beyond. The government has also offloaded its responsibility in road funding by untying the states grants and therefore local government grants, meaning that there is no guarantee that these funds will actually find their way to road funding at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Fightback the coalition would have saved the private motorist 19c per litre and the business motorist 26c per litre, while maintaining road funding at current levels in real terms.

Unlike their city cousins, country residents have limited access to public transport. The simple fact is that everything from food to machinery in country areas comes in on the back of a truck. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues have spoken with great eloquence, compassion and conviction about the stupidity of a government that seeks to increase the cost of transport in a country with one of the highest foreign debts in the world, an enormously high level of unemployment, and a country that is totally dependent on cheap transport costs if it is to be internationally competitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to confine my comments to the impact of this fuel increase on the boating industry of Australia. The boating industry, boat owners and boat users are the forgotten people when it comes to this iniquitous government tax grab. I want to speak on behalf of the millions of Australians who engage in boating as part of their normal leisure pursuits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely predictable that such people would be forgotten by this government. This government sits here in splendid isolation in the artificial inland city of Canberra. The government has been here for 11 years with all its bureaucrats devising these incredible taxes on ordinary Australians, forgetting that ordinary Australians live by the sea. One cannot even have power boats in Canberra. The government and its bureaucrats sit here and they never see a power boat. The public servants and the politicians would not know the effect that such a tax will have on the millions of Australians who actually use boats, because in this town people are restricted to sailing. The only power boat politicians and public servants ever see here is a ferry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important issue. It is not just the economic impact. The fact is that boating and fishing are two of the great leisure activities of Australians. Leisure is one of the real factors in the effective productivity of a nation. I think we forget that if a nation is to be productive and internationally competitive, its leisure activities are important. Boating and fishing are enjoyed by millions of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government probably is not aware&mdash;maybe some of its advisers are not aware&mdash;that most boats use petrol motors. They have an outboard on the back. One has to put petrol in it to make it go. Further, they just about all use leaded petrol. One of the most iniquitous things in this whole deal is that, under the guise of protecting the environment from the dreaded lead, leaded petrol is going to be made that much dearer. That is the latest treachery that has been played out on the people who indulge in boating and fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all about this government attacking the people it claims to represent. My colleagues have spoken about the fact that it is lower income Australians who are stuck with vehicles, made expensive by other policies of this government, that use leaded petrol. They are the ones being hit by this latest tax. It so happens that the people who use boats and indulge in boating in this country&mdash;as I say, there are millions of them&mdash;are, by and large, middle and lower income people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the delusions of the Labor Party is that it is the millionaires who sit around and drink wine, so it taxes the wine industry. It probably thinks, if it thinks about boat owners at all, that they are all rich. They are not; I can assure the government of that. They are ordinary Australians escaping from the misery of life under this government by getting out on the water. These people were deceived. There was no warning about any increase in petrol prices prior to the election. These people have been deceived by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, boating and fishing are pursuits enjoyed traditionally by the families of Australia. Most of our immigrants probably came here by boat. The first ones did and they have been coming here by boat for a long time. This is an island nation. We indulge our pursuit of boating because we love it and because we live by the sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a lot of these Australians, life has got very tough. We live in a country with very high unemployment, very high crime rates, moral breakdown and high interest rates. The economy has been in an awful mess for a very long time. A lot of Australians, therefore, seek some escape from this misery by indulging in boating and fishing&mdash;pursuits which require petrol. But there is absolutely no escape from this government. This government bludgeons them with a hike in the petrol price. Every time they go down to their boat ramp, Paul Keating is standing on the ramp, ready to take his cut of the increase in the petrol price. The really terrible thing about this is that the further out people go to sea to try to escape Paul Keating and his tax, the more tax they will pay, because the further out they go, the more petrol they will use and the more Paul will take from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Boat owners and users are already paying 26c per litre in petrol tax to this government; they pay an average of another 7c per litre to state governments to run their boats and this government is going to put on another 5c or 7c. This will have a dramatic effect on the capacity of Australians who love their boats and using them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, putting the extra tax on leaded over unleaded petrol is particularly vicious in relation to boat owners and boat users. Over 90 per cent of outboards in use can use only leaded petrol. It is a fact that only the most modern of outboard motors can use unleaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if you are a boat owner and you see that the government is going to tax leaded petrol much more than it is going to tax unleaded, you might think, `Well, perhaps I'd better go down and buy one of these new outboard motors'. As soon as you walk in the door the boat dealer says, `Look, I'm sorry but the federal government has got a 20 per cent tax on outboard motors. It has just gone up to 21 per cent and it is going to go up to 22 per cent'. So there is absolutely no incentive to buy a motor which will take unleaded petrol, which this government says it wants to encourage. It is another classic example of the government having utterly contradictory policies which tear at each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average age of outboard motors is over 10 years. We have heard evidence about the age of the car fleet in this country and why it is the voters that Labor claims to represent who are going to be most hurt by this tax increase, but the same thing applies to outboard motors. As I say, that is a direct reflection of the fact that boating is an activity primarily indulged in by middle and lower income Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets even worse. In order to be able to have a simple tin boat with an outboard motor on the back, a lot of ordinary Australians have sacrificed buying a new car. They keep the old car just that little bit longer because they spend their extra dollars on their boating activities. So they do not have new cars that take unleaded petrol. They can be seen down at the ramp driving in with their 15-year-old Holdens with the boat on the back. Now they are going to get slugged there. It is going to cost them that much more just to tow the boat to the ramp, before they even put the boat in the water with Paul Keating standing there ready to take the money off them as they drive away in their boat. </PARA>

There are 80,000 people employed in this industry. It is their livelihood. It is just about as big as the car industry. Annually, $500 million is spent on boats. This is a very big industry which has been struggling to survive under the recession which the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said that we had to have. A lot of boat businesses have gone under. What is this tax going to do to those boat businesses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increased petrol tax will have a number of very pernicious effects on the boating area. It will obviously restrict the capacity of ordinary Australians to indulge their love of boating and fishing. It cannot have any other effect. It is a luxurious dollar. It is a dollar that is spent with discretion, so it will suffer as a result of this tax increase. It will inevitably reduce the sales of boats, outboard motors, rods and tackle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reminds me that in 1978 I was a junior research officer in the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party when the then Fraser liberal government decided, for reasons of its own, that it could not honour promises made in the 1977 federal election which, everyone will recall, involved a fistful of dollars. Having been centrally involved in that campaign, I remember it well. Regrettably, that government in May 1978 broke its promises in relation to various aspects of tax. As the officer responsible for polling, I was more aware than anyone of the dramatic effect on the standing of that government as a result of its breaking of promises on taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people believe in a fair go; they believe that their governments have to be honest and up-front with them. That government was perceived not to have been honest with the Australian people and to have breached its faith with the Australian people, and it suffered accordingly. There was a dramatic decline in the polls; it stayed behind Labor all the way through from that period; it managed to recover in time for the 1980 federal election and scrape over the line; and, as soon as that election was over, it fell behind the Labor Party once again because of that very fundamental breach of faith in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view&mdash;and I think the Labor Party is perhaps too close to it to understand it&mdash;that this government has just now gone through that same experience.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Boat owners of Australia have been cheated by this government; they will now be paying much more for their boating pursuits. As I think Senator O'Chee mentioned, car owners may get something back for the tax they pay, but nothing like a fair return. In some countries, of course, the tax paid on petrol is more than matched by the money the collecting government puts into roads and facilities for motorists; that is not the case in this country, but at least motorists get some return for their dollars. Where is the return for the boat owners of Australia from the millions and millions of dollars they pay to this government in tax?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government cannot provide roads or their equivalent; the federal government, to my knowledge, does not provide any facilities for the boat owners of Australia. It is take, take, take on one of the great leisure pursuits of Australians. Boat owners get nothing in return for the taxes they pay to this government. They are going to be paying millions and millions of dollars more, so their capacity to escape from the rigours of life under Labor in this country is even further restricted.

Let's put a green garb over this particular measure; let's tell the Australian people that we're not really interested in taxing them more, we are interested in saving their children from lead poisoning'. I have yet to see any evidence of children dying in the streets from lead poisoning. But this government will resort to the most awful propaganda methods to take over $1 billion from Australians in a country so vast that it relies on cheap transport to transport goods and people and remain internationally competitive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. There is no doubt that the government's increases in fuel taxes will significantly impact on people and families in rural and regional areas and on those on low incomes. However, the coalition's support for the government's irresponsible income tax cuts has greatly restricted the options available to reduce the impact of increased petrol excise as it is a major ingredient in paying for those tax cuts. To fully compensate is virtually impossible and, in any case, compensation measures are imprecise. However, given that we are stuck with the income tax cuts, there is little alternative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some weeks ago, the National Farmers Federation recognised the link between the tax cuts and the inability of the government and others to give the kind of relief which is required, and it urged the coalition not to continue to support the tax cuts which are being given. But its appeal was to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Council of Social Service said that fuel and sales tax rises will impact more strongly on urban fringe dwellers and especially on people who live in regional and rural Australia. Fuel rises will have an added impact on basic costs of living in these areas because of the effect of added freight costs. I might add to that the concern which has been expressed to me by charities such as Meals-on-Wheels and the Blue Nurses who depend very heavily on motor vehicles to deliver the services which are so needed within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have already assisted country people to a far greater extent than anything the coalition has done so far by negotiating a reduction in the fuel tax hike from 10c per litre down to 7c per litre, and by ensuring that some of the money gained from the tax rise will be spent on what it is intended for&mdash;namely, addressing the impact of lead on Australians and our environment. Senator Coulter has explained our position on this and those negotiations continue. To reduce the fuel tax increase further than has already been achieved will simply put a large hole in the budget deficit&mdash;and that is the dilemma we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the last election, the Australian Democrats announced a policy which included increases in petrol excise; that policy was contained in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> document. It was a balanced approach which sought to bring together job creation and environmental responsibility. In contrast, at the time I was horrified by the Fightback proposal to slash the petrol excise and thus guarantee that our cities' roads would continue to be choked with cars. I believe this to be environmental vandalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad of the opportunity to refute also some of the misrepresentation of Democrat policy made by the coalition during the last election. I am minded to say that having the coalition try to explain our policy is about as useful as having Saddam Hussein explain US policy on the Gulf war to the Iraqi people. So let me put on record what <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> is all about; there are a number of basic assumptions. We believe that in terms of a fuel excise policy there is a need to balance health concerns, environmental responsibility, economic stability, job creation and debt reduction&mdash;and I believe that in our document we did all of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to reduce the number of motor vehicles on our city and suburban roads. There is a need to create work in new and environmentally friendly industries. There is a need to replace our dependence on fossil fuels. We believe that it is right and just to use the excise on fuel to accomplish these goals. In fact, we proposed an even higher rate of excise than the one in the measure before us. But it was a proposal for a higher rate of excise balanced with suitable measures to compensate rural industries and rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of our proposals was to balance the hike in petrol excise with a cancellation of registration and third party fees. We would replace these with a standard nation-wide scheme. The cost of owning a motor vehicle would be cheaper, but the cost of using that motor vehicle over a certain distance would become more expensive. By our calculations, that crossover point was 18,000 kilometres. However, in recognition that rural communities often drive great distances&mdash;and one study has set an average for rural families at 31,000 kilometres per year&mdash;we proposed that a full study of rural needs and costs, as well as measures to compensate, be carried out before imposing any higher excise. We believe this is the kind of process that the government ought to have put in place before introducing this measure. So we agree with the coalition in its stated fact that this will impact seriously on rural and regional families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the funds created by the higher excise also ought to be used to assist the transfer from dependence on fossil fuel to use of alternative renewable energy sources. My colleague Senator Coulter has already explained the work that we have done in replacing some of the fuel with ethanol. This is a job creation measure. At Manildra, in New South Wales, and certainly at certain points in Queensland, jobs would be created if this industry were enhanced in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also urge the provision of funding to upgrade public transport to assist both city and country people. We certainly would not be moving headlong to close down many of our railways, as both the coalition and the government have done in the past. This is the basis on which we have built our response to the whole idea of an increased excise on petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to put on the record some other measures which would be feasible in reducing the extra costs associated with living in non-metropolitan areas. One possible option is to resurrect the petroleum product freight subsidisation scheme. This scheme, which has been around in a number of forms since 1965, subsidises the freight cost on petrol to remote areas. Currently it subsidises only those freight costs which are greater than approximately 15c per litre. That helps virtually nobody. It currently costs the government only about $3 million a year. At one stage in 1981-82 the differential between city and country was 0.44c per litre, and the cost for that year was $147.5 million&mdash;obviously a much more significant attempt to address the differential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another measure which could be considered is increasing the zone rebate for income tax and the remote area allowance paid to DSS recipients. We have put forward these and other measures which would enable country people to reduce their costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that one measure which could be introduced is an increase in the sales tax on energy inefficient cars. Whilst the argument would be put that rural people need powerful cars to travel on the highways, an extra tax could be justified on at least large capacity engines. Tying sales tax levels to fuel efficiency has been promoted by us for some time. An extra tax on large capacity engines could raise money to offset some of the above compensation measures or it could be made revenue neutral by a related reduction in tax levels on small fuel efficient cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing registration fees and covering the cost by increasing the petrol excise would more adequately address the costs of road usage, according to those who use it most. Farmers who have to pay large registration fees for machinery which is driven relatively small distances around the farm and rarely on the road would be much better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me briefly address road transport. In this place a lot has been made of the increase in the cost of a shopping trolley of goods, which I have heard put at various amounts. One amount quoted is $3 every time the shopping trolley goes to the checkout counter. We would question the calculation of that amount; however, accepting that there is an increase in the shopping trolley cost, this means that increased freight costs have been passed on to the consumer. It seems strange to us that the road transport industry would then claim that it will have to bear the increased fuel excise on at least that proportion of the increase which is passed on. There is an inconsistency there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me address the differential between rural and city fuel prices. I am aware of a great inequity in fuel prices which people in non-metropolitan areas are subject to. Many studies have shown that the differential in petrol prices between city and country areas is far more than it should be. In effect, country people are subsidising city people's fuel. Effective price control mechanisms are difficult, as state governments have jurisdiction over much of this area, but they certainly would correct a very large injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Labor and the coalition are averse to government intervention in the operation of the market, so it makes it difficult&mdash;and sometimes impossible&mdash;for workable measures to be put in place to ensure that city people pay a fair price for petrol. But I believe this is a point at which those measures ought to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In South Australia there is a 3c per litre fuel freight rebate scheme, yet often there is up to a 16c differential between city and country prices. It is obvious that there is a need to take account of the misuse by oil companies of the fuel freight rebate. The government promised during the election to commission an independent review of tax imposts on the road transport industry. It is important that this review be held as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm families drive an average of 31,000 kilometres per year, compared with 19,000 kilometres per year for city families. This means an extra $2 to $3 per week in petrol alone for rural families. The Democrats have a longstanding policy objective enshrined in our constitution to stem and reverse the flow of population from rural and provincial areas to the cities. Even if these proposals positively discriminate in favour of rural dwellers, they are justifiable in view of this important objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even with those rural people who do use less fuel than city dwellers, it does not negate the fact that their options to use other means of transport are far fewer than those available to city people. It is reasonable to assume that increased fuel costs will impact more on the cost of living in non-metropolitan areas because of the increased freight costs to such areas. This cost should be recognised and compensation should be made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the coming months, the Democrats will continue to pursue possible options and will pressure the government to address the impact of its policies on rural communities, particularly as part of discussions about next year's budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two key issues in this debate that are highlighted for the Greens and they really expose a need for a much broader approach to public policy. The issues that are conflicting in the approach that has been taken by the government are social equity and environmental protection. Neither issue has been adequately addressed in the government's approach to reducing the amount of lead in petrol or to the fuel tax increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate to commence discussion with an examination of the environmental implications of this bill. Ostensibly, the proposal to increase the price of leaded petrol is designed to act as a market mechanism to encourage car owners to change to unleaded petrol wherever possible. This is undoubtedly a laudable aim, given the growing body of evidence that points to the detrimental health effects of lead on our children. We must, however, acknowledge the need to address the broader issue of the environmental and health implications of all vehicles emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a danger that, by concentrating only on the lead aspect of vehicle emissions, we may exacerbate the broader vehicle emission problems. There is scientific evidence which suggests that the adjustment of engines in older vehicles to allow them to use unleaded petrol will result in increased emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide and other vehicle pollutants that contribute to the growing air pollution problems in our cities as well as to the global greenhouse problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach that has been taken by the government also fails to address the more fundamental and long-term aspects of the problem of petrol usage. A price differential, as we have mentioned earlier, is useless if we perpetuate the urban sprawl that now dominates our cities and if we fail to provide planning options such as public transport, cycleways, urban villages and the like to encourage people out of cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, for example, studies have found that general emission levels have been maintained at high levels despite a reduction in the emission levels in individual vehicles. This is due to the fact that the average urban miles travelled by vehicles is increasing substantially. An appropriate analogy can be drawn with alcohol levels in beer. If a beer drinker switched to a low alcohol beer but increased the amount of beer consumed, it is likely that the level of alcohol in the blood could remain the same as that when consuming a lower level of high alcohol beer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of social equity is vitally important. From the beginning, there has been nothing equitable about car ownership. The rich own new cars; the poorer people own old ones. Older cars cost more to run and are less safe and efficient. In the last decade the rich have realised that there is much to be said for inner city living. There are more services available, more sociability, a sense of character and amenity. As the rich moved into the cities, demographers pointed out that the poor have been pushed to the urban fringes. The urban sprawl which fits so well with car use disadvantages those without cars. It also makes provision of services and public transport outside the city core increasingly expensive. Without public transport the poor are doubly disadvantaged and so buy old cars and the vicious cycle takes another turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does nothing about those fundamental problems. Cars are made more expensive to operate but no alternatives are provided. Funding for alternatives is being cut; the poor are made poorer. The answer is not, as Senator Chapman suggested yesterday, that this country desperately needs cheaper cars. That is not an adequate solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A market based approach to this problem that does not contain measures to alleviate the impact of increased prices on those with low incomes is unjust. It is acknowledged that many of those who own the older cars that use leaded petrol are low income earners. These people are also often forced to live on the fringes of cities and, as a consequence, need to travel greater distances for work or social reasons. Not only will these people have to bear the additional costs associated with increased petrol prices but, if they wish to avoid that price difference, they will need to either buy a new car or modify their existing vehicles to allow them to use unleaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond this&mdash;and the opposition speakers have referred to this consistently&mdash;there is the impact on the rural sector. While truck-in, truck-out rural towns do not foster local-regional development, there will be a major impact on these towns. Specific programs for rural development are also being cut along with many services such as schools, medical services and postal services, which are eroded within portfolios in the name of economic rationalisation. While not actually linking these issues to this bill, we feel that any government with integrity and the interests of ordinary people at heart cannot proceed with measures such as this unless it is also doing something to reduce the impact, through stimulating the local-regional economies that can reduce the dependency on long haul road freight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the present package fails to satisfy us because, while it does address the environmental concerns that we have, it does not actually address the social equity impact of what basically amounts to revenue raising measures. Because of that, the Greens have provided, through Senator Margetts, the foreshadowed amendments. We believe that these amendments will at least use the gain in revenue that the government is earning through the increases in a way that people will benefit from rather than it simply going into revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government expects to realise over $800 million a year on the increase in petrol excise. It expects to realise about $175 million in additional income through the tax on leaded petrol. At the same time, it is cutting 57 per cent of its funding for programs that would improve the environmental and equity situation in relation to car use. The purpose of the amendments that are being put forward by Senator Margetts are to tie the government to positive action in implementing its own policy recommendations in relation to sustainable development and to establish standards so that problems such as the current lead emission crisis can be avoided in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution of 1c per litre to a trust fund would be about $160 million or 10 per cent of the cost of existing programs currently being cut. The lead levels set in our foreshadowed amendments are those agreed upon in the round table discussion between the department of the environment, the states and industry. The timetable is that agreed upon at that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We failed to enact standards on leaded petrol and lead petrol engines when other nations did; we are now paying the price. We must ensure that we do not fall so far behind by setting our standards for new car emissions and efficiency levels at the highest level demanded by other nations, especially by major markets such as the USA and the European Common Market. Not only will we benefit through reduced pollution and energy use, but our domestic industry will build to standards similar to those demanded by international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, car use is inherently inequitable. The poor are excluded from cars; the slightly better off have old, inefficient cars. Yet our cities are designed around car use and penalise those who do not own cars. The poorest increasingly find themselves marginalised in the outer fringes where transport lines are longest and both services and public transport are least available. Car use will not ever be made equitable or sustainable. The way to achieve both social and environmental objectives is through restructuring our cities to reduce the need for private cars. This was the clear conclusion of the government's ESD transport working group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts has already mentioned the government's announcement that it will cut programs for urban development and public transport from $2.8 billion in 1992-93 to $1.2 billion in 1996-97. This is contrary to any attempt to adequately address the social or environmental effect of car use. It is a disgrace when the government is putting up petrol taxes and using environmental concerns as a justification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">US studies have shown that carbon taxes that go into general revenue cost 10 to 25 times more than the cost of programs aimed at directly reducing energy use to accomplish the same reduction. We may force some people out of cars but it will be neither fair nor efficient. Using a small part of the revenue on the same basis as road funding to directly address the need for urban restructuring is a simple solution. Rural areas will be hit disproportionately at a time when they are suffering cutbacks in many other areas. Rural development programs will be halved in the next four years. While reducing the dependency on long haul shipping is a valid goal, it will not be achieved simply by making it more expensive. Support for rural development, especially development of local regional industries to replace shipping, will generate employment while making communities more sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rail and shipping are important factors and they will be impacted on by this bill. Coastal shipping is important to Australia and is under threat from ships which take in fuel in other Asian nations. This measure will not help to make shipping more efficient and competitive. Rail is important in improving the efficiency and safety of long haul freight, especially rural agricultural freight and urban public transport. These areas should be supported as more sustainable alternatives as they were targeted as important in the ESD transport recommendations. That is the reason why we have foreshadowed these amendments and I commend them to my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel that there has to be some guarantee from the government that it will introduce measures that are more than simply revenue raising exercises. We believe that, if the public is to face an increase in the cost of petrol, we should be regulating the industry very strictly. The maximum allowable levels of lead in petrol should be set at 0.2 grams per litre and a clear schedule for phasing out leaded petrol should be established. The Senate should be satisfied that the federal government has used all means at its disposal to ensure compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also suggested in our amendments that fuel for sea freight and diesel for rail services should be exempted from the increases provided for in this bill. We would like the Australian Design Rules, embodying best world standard principles, to be incorporated in setting all emission levels for all new vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to implement a strategy that acknowledges these concerns. The lead abatement strategy, proposed by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly), is a partial approach to that problem. The amendments proposed by the Democrats and the Greens also attempt to address this. We welcome the support that any of those amendments may gain from the opposition and, we wish, from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the petrol consumption in our community, we really want something that takes into consideration all factors, including environmental factors&mdash;that means reducing car use and consumption as well as taxing&mdash;and health and safety factors. We do not want to simply shift people from one fuel to another. The shift from leaded to unleaded petrol and the differential involved is a positive thing from the point of view of the Greens. I quote from an article by Newman and Kenworthy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It now appears that removing lead from petrol is essential from a health and environmental perspective, beneficial in terms of energy and other emissions, and of marginal cost if not benefit to the motorist. One wonders if the past decade of intense controversy on this issue which has cost so much time, money and human energy, could have been considerably eased if the environmental perspective had been treated more credibly.</PARA>
<PARA>We do not believe that a levy is the best way to make the changes that are proposed unless they encompass a broadly based package on energy use. A levy on its own is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens do support taxing energy. We feel that the full cost of our energy consumption in today's world is not being evaluated. Therefore, when the price goes up it is appropriate to remember that it is reflecting a cost that energy consumption has to the environment and to the health and safety of people. In July we believed that some such tax might be imposed. We wrote to the minister for the environment and said that we supported the possible introduction of an energy tax but were cautious about supporting an immediate increase in the price of leaded petrol because our principal concern was the potentially regressive impact of an energy tax or a price increase in leaded petrol. We felt that the government should take steps to reduce the negative impact on the poor and powerless before any new measures were introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were very concerned, and still are, about the amount of lead in petrol and the harmful effect of this, especially on children, the onus needs to be on petroleum companies to reduce the amount of lead in petrol, particularly in Western Australia, which has the highest lead levels in Australia. We also support the introduction of a price differential to encourage drivers to switch to unleaded petrol. I wrote that letter on 30 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I felt that simply raising the petrol levy misses an opportunity to green the tax system as a whole. A broadly based energy tax, announced at the same time as the detail of the income tax cuts, would have been much more helpful in shifting taxes from income to the use of non-renewable resources&mdash;a very expensive use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are in favour of taxes and charges that encourage more efficient resource use and reduce environmental degradation but these should be part of a socially responsible package to encourage energy conservation. A well constructed energy package could do this, reducing urban congestion and greenhouse emissions, and could also provide funds for improved government services for payment of public debt. However, money raised by the taxes should first be directed towards addressing energy and equity issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sustainable development involves social justice as well as environmental concern. The Greens care for people as well as the planet. This means ensuring policies are equitable as well as ecologically and economically possible. While we support these bills, we express serious concerns over their impact, and that is why we have foreshadowed our amendments and we urge our colleagues to support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with some interest to Senator Chamarette's very reasoned and obviously sincere speech on the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. From what Senator Chamarette has said, I gather that the Western Australian Greens will be opposing the increase in the taxes on fuel. Apparently I do not have that right. From what she said, I could have been led to that conclusion. I was going to say that that was a refreshing change. Some of her ideas about alternative solutions were quite interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the Western Australian Greens at face value and accept their sincerity. I cannot do the same for my colleagues in the Australian Democrats. They are now trying to be the party of the bush&mdash;the rural party&mdash;saying how concerned they are about matters rural and the people living in rural areas. Yet they ran to the election with a range of policies&mdash;and continue to promote it&mdash;which are anti-bush and anti anyone who lives in remote areas. I briefly remind honourable senators in passing that it was the Democrats who proposed a 16.5 per cent increase in the fuel tax.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats, who now claim to be a party with a great interest in a rural constituency, were also the ones who wanted an assets tested wealth tax, new additional taxes on fossil fuels, a new federal land tax and a new inheritance tax. They wanted to increase the wool tax and the top marginal rate of tax to 60 per cent and ban the live sheep export industry. They did not want, and apparently still do not want, any tax cuts at present. One can only wonder at the changing approaches of the Democrats, no doubt in an attempt to build their rural constituency and grab a few votes for their party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to this debate in all its entirety and it is now drawing to a close. It is with some sadness that I think of what Australia might have been. These increases in the petrol tax alone will add $580 million in tax to business and to our exports, which are what keeps Australia going. When I think how that makes us internationally uncompetitive and adds to the cost of the goods that we produce&mdash;which we have to try to sell overseas in competition with goods that are produced without those sorts of taxes&mdash;it makes me very sad indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the federal election campaign we proposed to completely remove the fuel tax. One can only wonder at the enormously beneficial impact that would have had on business in Australia and our exporting industries&mdash;the things that would get Australia going&mdash;and the jobs it would create. If Australia had boomed as an economy because it was selling so much more overseas and its goods were internationally competitive, think of the jobs that would have been saved. Instead of having record unemployment and human and personal tragedy under this government, we could have had people working and a country booming. So it is with some real sadness that I speak in this debate, opposing yet another $580 million worth of taxes on jobs that will put even more Australians out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range of these measures that are before the parliament at the moment have been very well debated and examined by my colleagues in this debate.

In passing, I will comment on the tobacco matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the federal election, I concede that we, like every other party, proposed increased taxes on tobacco, so we will not be opposing this measure at present. I come from the Mareeba area of North Queensland and we were subjected to a lot of submissions by the tobacco industry, which is facing a real problem. None of us can enjoy its predicament. Tobacco is the major industry of the Mareeba area, and its returns have been falling. The quantity of leaf that the industry has been selling is falling and it is in a real predicament. It really cannot grow much else successfully in that area, although it is getting into sugarcane at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco industry representatives have approached us over this issue and they did so prior to the election. I said, `I would like to help you.

We went to the election on a contrary proposal and it would be foolish and dishonest to say anything different to you now'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned this recently when travelling in a plane north with Mr Remzi Mulla, the head of the Tobacco Leaf Marketing Board. I said to him&mdash;I do not relate this as being Liberal-National party policy because it is not my responsibility to do that&mdash;that I would like the industry to find some proposal that would allow what is left of the Australian tobacco leaf industry to get a greater share of the tobacco that will forever be smoked within Australia. I do not know how to do that. I do not know which way to advise my friends in the Mareeba tobacco industry. I simply say to them that is what they have to look at. They have to turn all their attention to trying to find some answers to that so that we in this parliament can look at it and see if there is some way that we can help. There is no way that taxes on tobacco will fall. But accepting the fact that, no matter what tax is charged, some people will continue to smoke, I believe Australia has to act in the interests of the tobacco industry in Far North Queensland. </PARA>

That means that the fuel tax currently paid by the Brisbane City Council is some $5 million. That amount is sucked out of the ratepayers in the Brisbane area. But the new tax, which it seems will go ahead, will put the Brisbane City Council in an even worse position. In one fell swoop, the Brisbane City Council will owe another $982,061 to the federal government in fuel tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry has asked for the source of these tables. The information as to litres used is information that was obtained by me prior to the last election in a survey of all councils. The others are just simply calculations that multiply litres used by the tax rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out, based on those tables, that the Cairns local authority will pay in fuel tax to the federal government an extra $26,000, the Maroochy shire on the Sunshine Coast will pay an extra $115,000, and the Gold Coast will pay an extra $109,000. This is one level of government paying a tax to another level of government. It seems incredible that the federal government could impose this sort of taxation on other levels of government. The first sheet that I have incorporated refers to Queensland councils. The second table that I have incorporated shows a range of councils around Australia. Ballina, on the north coast of New South Wales, will pay an additional $37,000-odd in increased fuel tax; Melbourne will pay an extra $548,000. Those figures are there for people to study. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was referring to the three tables that I incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The third table shows the impact on rural councils of the increase in fuel tax. The impact is even larger on a per capita basis because in the country people and councils use relatively more fuel. The tax burden in country areas is distributed between relatively fewer ratepayers&mdash;in some cases only a few hundred. The table shows the impact on some councils in Queensland. The council in the Barcoo Shire has only 189 ratepayers. The increase in the fuel tax will add an additional $14,000 to the rates in that locality, which averages out at another $74 per ratepayer. This is the result only of the increased fuel tax paid by their council because of this government's actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland, of course, is not alone in this. Coober Pedy, with 2,200 ratepayers, must surely be, one would think, one of the government's worst enemies in South Australia. The Coober Pedy shire uses 3.1 million litres of petrol and diesel. The figure is unusually high because the local electricity supply is run by diesel power. The average 5c a litre increase in the fuel tax amounts to a $70.45 increase in the average rate bill for every ratepayer in the Coober Pedy shire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that the Labor and Democrats senators from South Australia bear that in mind when they vote this evening on this bill. I can assure them that I will be letting the residents of Coober Pedy know how their representatives voted in this debate. If the Democrat and Labor Party senators vote for this increase in fuel tax excise, I will tell the people of Coober Pedy that their representatives voted to increase their rate bill by $70. I will let them know that all of the Liberal representatives in South Australia, particularly the new and very good member for Grey, Mr Barry Wakelin, stood up for their interests in this parliament. We will see whether the Democrats, who seem to be interested in stopping tax blows when they apply to the wine industry in South Australia, have the interests of the people of the Coober Pedy shire at heart when they vote on this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Panizza says, in all remote areas. The government has the gall to shout from the roof tops about the minuscule increase in financial assistance grants to local government, when it is creaming off nearly all of that increase and more through the increase in the fuel tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in financial assistance grants to local government in the budget was 0.4 per cent, but the increase in fuel tax that local government will pay is well in excess of that. That is a bitter pill for local government. It is more so when the government spends so little of the revenue raised from fuel on the country road system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time, in the Fraser days&mdash;the days of the previous Liberal government&mdash;things were different. Under the previous coalition government, almost all revenue raised from the fuel excise went towards roads. In 1983 under Fraser, about 6c of the 7c a litre excise was used to fund roads. Of the current 26c a litre of excise on fuel, about 6.5c goes towards roads&mdash;a disastrous and quite atrocious allocation to the road network from the fuel excise paid on the petrol that we consume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fuel excise is up by 120 per cent since 1983 but road funding is down by about 20 per cent. The budget proposes to reduce from the current 27 per cent to a mere 18 per cent the percentage of revenue raised from the fuel tax which is spent on roads. Following this increase, only 18 per cent of the fuel excise we pay will be used on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Shire Association President, Mr Wal Mitchell, recently said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . increasing the fuel tax by at least 5c a litre over the next 12 months represents an increase in the purchase price of petrol of around 7.5%.</PARA>
<PARA>The impact is even greater in country areas where leaded fuel is more widely used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I have almost run out of time. I emphasise that the impact of the fuel excise increase on local government is quite dramatic. This federal government continues to rip off another level of government with taxation increases from which it is not reimbursed. For all that the government says at election time about how much it is looking after local government, it seems to conveniently overlook the fact that it increasingly taxes local government in order to collect revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intended to make reference to the impact that the increase in fuel tax would have on the area of Australia that I represent, which is generally North Queensland. Time has beaten me. But I emphasise that those of us who live in areas remote from capital cities have to use fuel more than our city counterparts. Many people who live in the cities would not understand that simply to go to a doctor, to a school or to a cultural activity requires a round trip of 200 or 300 kilometres. That is not done by choice; it is done because there is no other solution. Everything we use in the north is transported by road. The increase in fuel tax and the increase in sales tax which the government is introducing will impact upon country people. Because my time is up, I cannot give the attention I would have liked to that aspect of the increase in fuel tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;There has been lengthy debate on the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. These debates always generate a lot of concern and interest in the Senate. I do not think it would be unkind to the contributors who have made earnest and, in many cases, substantial contributions to say that, nevertheless, their speeches are essentially reiterations of known positions. I am not going to take the time of the Senate by responding point by point. I acknowledge the contributions that honourable senators from all sides have made in the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Always when we are debating major revenue measures there are legitimate calls of apprehension about the consequences of the process by which the revenue is being raised. No revenue proposal is met with enthusiasm. People do not say, `This is absolutely right; it is a wonderful idea&mdash;please tax us a bit more'. I have not found that tax yet, and I have been looking for a while. I understand those concerns but honourable senators have to see this legislation in the context that this is another part of revenue which is an important aspect of the medium term deficit reduction strategy&mdash;a strategy which is very important and which is looking somewhat better than some people thought it might have been a little while ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have those recent indications of support. I am also optimistic about the outcome of the vote. I think I have indicated to the whole Senate&mdash;I have certainly indicated to Senator Watson and other members of the opposition&mdash;that once we finish the second reading stage, it is our intention to adjourn the committee stage so that we can resume the second reading debate of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we are not going to move to the committee stage immediately, I will respond to a couple of foreshadowed amendments. Obviously, I do not agree with the opposition's second reading amendment, but that is a routine exercise. I will not waste any time discussing that; it is fairly standard action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments foreshadowed by Senator Margetts fundamentally go to a concern about whether the government is serious about the lead abatement strategy. The answer is yes, we are. This measure, as well as raising revenue, will be beneficial in terms of its health consequences. I will be making that commitment clear in a package which I expect to be able to make public during the evening. I think that will allay people's concerns about the genuineness of the lead abatement strategy commitment of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though Senator Harradine has not spoken in the second reading debate, I understand that he has circulated a proposed amendment. I indicate that the government will be accepting Senator Harradine's amendment. That will allay some of the serious concerns that people had about the aspect of the bill which he is addressing. I reiterate that the government will be accepting and voting for the amendment to be moved by Senator Harradine. I indicate once again that, after the motion for the second reading of each bill has been passed, I will move the adjournment of the committee stage. I urge support for the second reading of this important package of measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. We are continuing with the second reading debate of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993. I want to say at the outset that I think the package is in an unsatisfactory state because one of the key issues within the bill is that relating to credit unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the government has significant amendments to its own bill resulting from, in part anyway, the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that has just brought down a report, but I do not know what those amendments are. I know what the committee has recommended. I understand that Senator McMullan, to be fair to him, has given Senator Watson some idea of what the government is proposing. But it really means that the Senate is now in a second reading debate on a bill which will not be the bill that the government seeks to have carried. It is not as though it is a minor amendment; as I understand it, it is a substantial amendment that really changes the whole tenor of the bill in relation to credit unions, and that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, as a result of another Senate committee which brought down its report, the provisions in relation to fringe benefits tax will be substantially changed. As we understand it, the provisions, as they relate to travel, will be removed from the bill. So that is not just a normal amendment that one gets in the committee stage of debate either; that is changing the structure of the bill as a whole in a very significant way. Therefore, for a second reason, the Senate is apparently being asked to debate something here tonight which is not the bill that the government will seek to have carried. That is highly unsatisfactory. If it means that the committee stage debate takes longer as a result of it, so be it, but what the government is seeking of us is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to concentrate on tonight is the issue of unconstitutionality&mdash;the doubtful constitutionality&mdash;of both the first bill and the second bill. The government concedes unconstitutionality in relation to the second bill, but not in relation to the first bill. It is an issue that I have spoken about on earlier occasions in relation to the government's package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to express our opposition to the retrospective aspects of accumulated annual leave which, I understand, still remain in the government's bill after its own changes. But the important part of the debate will be in relation to those sections that I mentioned earlier&mdash;the credit unions and fringe benefits tax&mdash;about which we are not fully informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, when the government initially presented its budget legislation to the parliament, as you will remember, many of the revenue raising measures were contained in one bill&mdash;the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. The coalition received advice from several eminent constitutional lawyers that the bill, if enacted, would be vulnerable to a successful challenge under section 55 of the constitution. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, of section 55. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs or of excise, shall deal with one subject of taxation only; but laws imposing duties of customs shall deal with duties of customs only, and laws imposing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only.</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the first paragraph of the section is that a law which imposes taxation cannot contain other measures. If it does, those other measures are invalid. Pursuant to the second paragraph, a law which imposes taxation cannot deal with more than one subject of taxation. If it does, the whole of the bill is invalid. The clear purpose of this section, combined with section 53, which prevents the Senate originating or amending money bills, is to allow the Senate to consider one taxation measure at a time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we sought to refer the question of the constitutional validity of this bill, which contained measures including changes to the wholesale sales tax, income tax and fringe benefits tax, to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The fundamental issue was whether  any of the measures in the bill amounted to an imposition of taxation. While a range of opinions were presented to the committee on this question, only the government's principal adviser, the Chief General Counsel, expressed the view that there was definitely no imposition of taxation and, therefore, no risk of invalidity. The many submissions to the committee arguing that the bill may be unconstitutional divided broadly into two groups: those arguing that an increase in a rate of taxation amounts to an imposition of taxation, and those arguing that any increase in the incidence of taxation amounts to an imposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of these submissions, the committee unanimously concluded that there was a real risk which was significant that the bill, if enacted, would be found by the High Court to be a law imposing taxation within the meaning of section 55. At this point the government backed down and withdrew the bill. Its contents were then reintroduced in the other place in a series of eight new bills. Six of those bills&mdash;five dealing with wholesale sales tax and another containing the restructured l-a-w, law, personal income tax cuts&mdash;have already been considered. The remaining measures have been put into the two bills which are before us now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 consists of provisions relating to the extension of the fringe benefits tax, which we think will be withdrawn; changes in the income tax payable by credit unions, which we think will be substantially changed, and in the income tax payable on lump sums for unused annual and long service leave; denial of income tax deductions for car parking expenses for self-employed persons; and increases in the Medicare levy for low income thresholds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993 consists of an increase in the rate of fringe benefits tax and an increase in the rate of tax on the life insurance business of friendly societies. The government claims that it has structured the bill in this way as what it refers to as a `test bill' combining two rate increases for different subjects of taxation in order to facilitate a High Court challenge on the issues raised before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also received advice indicating that the constitutionality of Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 was doubtful. Both bills were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Four of the eight members of that committee, three coalition senators and one Democrat senator, came to the conclusion that both bills were of doubtful constitutionality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the No. 1 bill, the discussion centred on the new tax regime which is established for credit unions. Clause 41 of the bill removes an exemption which has previously applied to a large proportion of the income of credit unions, and clause 47 specifies a tax rate of 20 per cent for that income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's advisers argued to the committee that this is not an imposition of taxation; in fact, it amounts to a reduction, because the abolition of the exemption results in an liability to pay company tax at the general rate of 33 per cent, which is then reduced to 20 per cent by clause 47. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side of the argument was ably put by Mr Tony Morris QC, who pointed out that the effect of clauses 41 and 47 taken together is that credit unions will now be liable to pay income tax at a rate of 20 per cent on income on which they are presently required to pay no tax. He considered that there is a real risk that the High Court would find that this amounts to an imposition of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All four non-government senators accepted that there was a real chance that a High Court challenge to the validity of the bill may result in this provision being held to amount to an imposition of taxation. The consequence of such a finding would be that the provisions of the bill relating to other subjects of taxation would be struck down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further opinions provided to the committee suggested that there was also a risk, albeit a lesser one, that the extension of fringe benefits tax to excess domestic travel allowance may amount to an imposition of taxation. If the argument is accepted that any increase in the incidence of taxation amounts to an imposition, then the application of fringe benefits tax to a fringe benefit which was previously untaxed is an imposition of taxation. If the High Court accepted this argument, then the bill would be totally invalid as it deals with more than one subject of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, all non-government senators on the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs took the view that there was a real risk that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993, if challenged, would be found to be either partially or totally invalid. Given the potentially disastrous consequences for the government's revenues of such a decision, the coalition believes that it is irresponsible in the extreme for the government to persist in putting forward legislation of dubious validity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the coalition is concerned, this also applies to Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993, the so-called test bill. In his second reading speech, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been deliberately designed to facilitate a challenge in the High Court on the constitutional issues raised before the Senate committee that considered the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>The argument put to the committee was that an increase in a rate of taxation may amount to an imposition of taxation. The bill consists of increases in the rates of two different subjects of taxation&mdash;fringe benefits tax and income tax. The coalition believes that it is improper practice to deliberately put before the parliament legislation which the government accepts may be unconstitutional. We believe that the bill ought to be put into a form which is unambiguously valid, and dealt with on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence given to the legal and constitutional affairs committee suggests that the drafting time required to break up the No. 1 bill into separate bills each dealing with a different subject of taxation would be minimal&mdash;certainly less than a day. Presumably even less time would be required to split the so-called test bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that, in relation to bills Nos 1 and 2, I will be moving amendments emphasising that the Senate is of the view that the proposals in the bills ought to have been put forward as separate bills dealing with separate matters of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading amendment in relation to Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 will also condemn the government for including in the bill a measure which subjects the accrued leave entitlements of Australian workers to retrospective increases in taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we have before us Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) and Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). These two bills form part of a package of eight bills which replaced the former Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) contains the following measures: increases in the Medicare levy for low income thresholds; removal of the concessional treatment that applies to the taxation of unused annual leave and long service leave; changes in the taxation treatment of excess domestic travel allowances and expenses and certain non-deductible expenses&mdash;we understand that there will be a government amendment removing the travel component from that; denial of income tax deduction for car parking expenses for self-employed persons; and changes in the tax treatment of credit unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of credit unions, the Senate will be aware of a unanimous report by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. It was agreed by the committee that exemption should apply to the very smallest of the credit unions and building societies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) contains provisions which increase the rate of fringe benefits tax in the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 from 48.25 per cent to 48.4 per cent to commence on 1 April 1994. It changes the taxation treatment of friendly societies and increases the rate of tax on their life insurance business, to apply from the 1994-95 income year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The No. 2 bill is the government's so-called test bill&mdash;so-called because it is intended to test the second paragraph of section 55 of the constitution. Although it is obvious to all except the government, the No. 1 bill suffers the same constitutional defect as the No. 2 bill. The No. 2 bill clearly deals with more than one subject of taxation. The government has presented the bill in this form for the stated purpose of inviting a test case before the High Court before any of the provisions come into operation. It is an extraordinary situation that will involve testing the patience of Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a budget compromised by the mendacity pursuant to which it was drafted and riddled with economically irresponsible and politically unsaleable measures, it is perhaps bill No. 2 with its dubious constitutional status that represents the highest development of the government's erratic and irrational behaviour over this particular budget. Never before has a government been so irresponsible, so careless of the costs it is imposing on the community, so shabbily desperate to save face politically as to draft a bill that is deliberately unconstitutional. The government should not wonder why people are suspicious about its planned constitutional changes to bring about a republic when it so readily displays such an arrant lack of respect for the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with the government's behaviour in the drafting of the omnibus bill. The original bill, which has now been split into eight bills, was designed solely with a political although somewhat obscure purpose in mind. The solitary explanation of this strategy came from Senator Evans who stated that the bill's form was for demonstration and presentation purposes or to make clear the connection between tax changes. So, despite even the Tax Office expressing concerns about the constitutional status of the bill and raising its concerns with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel before the drafting stage, the government decided to risk its entire budget being declared unconstitutional, with all the financial chaos associated with such a decision. It is appalling that it made such a decision. The government can scarcely complain about its failures with these budget bills when its behaviour&mdash;certainly apparently, if nothing else&mdash;has constituted an attempt to do precisely that which section 55 of the constitution was designed to prevent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the original omnibus bill was designed to put pressure on the Senate, all it succeeded in doing was to make the government look like a cabal of constitutional vandals. The government, in its confusion, fell between two stools in that, if the bill imposed taxation, section 55 would be breached; if the bill did not impose taxation, section 53 would not apply and the Senate could amend it freely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to deal with the purpose of the second paragraph of section 55 of the constitution. I think it is vital when we are looking at any statutory provision, in particular, a constitutional provision, to look at the purpose the provision is intended to serve. Section 55's existence, of course, is explained by first looking at section 53. In the words of Justice Dixon, as he then was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of Section 55 [is] to protect the Senate from any possible abuse of the restriction placed upon it by Section 53, which provides that the Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>The second paragraph of section 53 of the constitution deprives the Senate of the power to amend taxation bills, although it may constitutionally reject them. However, if section 55 contained no other paragraph but its first, the House of Representatives would still be able to exploit the Senate's inability to amend legislation imposing taxation by sending to the Senate a bill containing a number of separate, unrelated taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid this, the constitution requires that each proposed tax be contained in a separate bill. In this way, the Senate will maintain its right to examine and possibly veto each specific tax without having to reject taxes of which it approves or disapproves. It was noted with approval at the turn of the century:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this respect, the Senate will have greater control over taxation than the House of Lords enjoys.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Dixon went on to cite approvingly the words of Mr Justice Isaacs who eloquently stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition was not inserted as a trap for the Commonwealth legislature and through them the nation. It was intended as a genuine protection to the people of the Commonwealth by guarding the Senate from compulsive acquiescence in one tax by the moral necessity of passing another distinct tax.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the endowment of the House of Representatives with the exclusive power to originate money bills and the Senate's deprivation of the power to amend money bills imposing taxation that render this limitation in the hands of the Senate one of the constitutional compromises of a bicameral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present High Court has noted with approval Mr Justice Barton's remarks that `the purpose of the second paragraph of section 55 was to prevent the tacking together of tax bills of different kinds in unlimited numbers in one measure'. Further, the court stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point of insisting on a law imposing taxation dealing with one subject of taxation only was to ensure separate consideration by each House of particular kinds of taxation, and that each would be considered `on its merits' and not just as an element in an overall package</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;which the government tried to do in its original measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now comment on the result of the breach of section 55. Sir Owen Dixon may have referred to the `hitherto ineffectual menaces' of section 55, but the potential for chaos inherent in its breach should be apparent also to all responsible senators. To understand the consequences of such a breach, it is necessary to date the history of the provision. Clause 55, subclause 3 of the Commonwealth Bill 1891 provided that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with one subject of taxation. These provisions were adopted in the first draft at the Adelaide Constitutional Convention of 1897. The advocates for the change were impressive, including Sir George Reid, our fourth Prime Minister and great free trader, and Sir Isaac Isaacs, later a High Court Justice and Viceroy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of section 55 has a profound bearing on our understanding of the result of a breach of section 55. It contains the reasons why we should be prudent and responsible in dealing with a possible violation of the section. The founding fathers expressly rejected the possibility that such a breach could do anything but invalidate the whole bill&mdash;and I emphasise `the whole bill'. They were well aware of the grave consequences of such a penalty but they did not shy away from this severity, believing it to be an essential constitutional protection. The word `proposed' was deliberately omitted with the express intention that absolute nullity would attach to any offending act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To quote a learned source on the penalty for ignoring section 55:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only conclusion is that an Act embodying a plurality of taxes would be absolutely and completely ultra vires.</PARA>
<PARA>It is incumbent upon us to treat the prohibition with a seriousness warranted by such dire results. The genesis of this distinction lies in an early judgment of Barton J who, in referring to a land tax assessment act, characterised it as `certainly an act relating to, that is it deals with the imposition of a tax', while going on to say that that did not make it a law imposing taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1), its aspects are generally the same as those in the originating Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, except for a small technical change in the amendment concerning clause 47 of the Income Tax Rates Act. The proposals contained in this bill in many cases have created serious inequity for individual taxpayers and have imposed impossible administrative and financial burdens on business. I refer in particular to the lump sum leave arrangements, the non-deductible expenses changes and the changes to car parking expenses for the self-employed. As noted by the Taxation Institute of Australia in its submission to the government on the original deficit reduction bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many of [these] incremental or base broadening measures . . . have been ill thought out and will create further unnecessary complexity to the tax system which is already overburdened with a confusing mass of tax rules that inhibit business and confuse ordinary taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>The submission continues by noting that the attempt to interrelate fringe benefits tax rules with the new rules designed to limit tax deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act appear to have been created at a theoretical level without regard to their practical application. In fact, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu in its media release of 19 August notes that the government has created an entertainment nightmare with regard to the non-deductible expense changes. The proposed changes to the fringe benefits tax legislation contain a number of anomalies in respect of the provision of entertainment to employees by employers which are difficult to interpret and quantify, demonstrating a lack of commonsense and due regard for business practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, entertainment expenses are both non-tax deductible and not subject to the FBT. But from 1 April 1994, in addition to entertainment, a range of benefits&mdash;such as club fees, leisure facilities, travel expenses of accompanying relatives, HECS payments and student financial supplement scheme payments&mdash;will be an allowable deduction to employers and, consequently, will subject those benefits to a fringe benefits tax liability. I have received representations from a number of accounting firms and business constituents as to the practical effects of the government's decision to treat non-deductible entertainment involving employees as subject to fringe benefits tax; in fact, the legislation will create all sorts of anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, entertainment provided to employees for the firm's benefit will now be more expensive due to the grossing-up effect used in the calculations of the fringe benefits tax. For every $1 spent on the provision of entertainment to employees, the total after-tax cost to the employer will be $1.27&mdash;the additional 27c being the grossed-up FBT amount, reduced by virtue of the FBT being allowable as a tax deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, an issue arises as to the interpretation of whether an entertainment benefit has been provided to an employee. For example, a self-employed person requested one of his employees to attend a business lunch with a client. In the absence of attending the lunch, the employee would probably have purchased sandwiches. Therefore, the employee has received a benefit by attending the business lunch. FBT is therefore payable on the total cost of his portion of the business lunch, while the portion applicable to the client and the self-employed person is non-deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this situation is viewed on the scale of a large Australian company whose sales force may, for example, purchase some 10,000 lunches for its clients in the course of a year, the burdensome and unnecessary volume of paperwork that will result is ridiculous and shows a complete lack of understanding of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that bookkeeping costs, including additional staff to maintain appropriate records and changes to the computer system, may well exceed the FBT payable. As the records are now needed for taxation purposes, they will need to show how much of the costs are related to the employee, which are deductible and subject to the FBT, and how much are related to the client, which are non-deductible. These business lunches are not big affairs. An example which has been cited to me is that they are usually counter meals at a hotel or sandwiches and coffee at a local cafe, with the average cost being about $40 for the entire lunch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's rationale for the change is that corporate entertainment, which is presently non-deductible and not subject to the FBT, is being used to package remuneration in a tax effective manner. If this is the real intention behind the proposed changes, a far more simple and less costly solution could be to make entertainment costs of employees incurred in the course of undertaking their duties as employees non-deductible and not subject to FBT&mdash;that is, subject to the existing rule&mdash;but to treat other entertainment of employees under the proposed new rules. Thus the government's stated objective could be achieved without imposing significant compliance costs on employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some minor situations may slip through the intended net, but the impact of these on revenue would have to be far less than the compliance costs imposed on business by the current proposal&mdash;unless, of course, the real motive behind the government's initiative is to exploit the situation of the $1.27 for each $1 spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, the government has decided to remove the FBT excess travel allowance provisions from the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) and to introduce&mdash;and this is the catch&mdash;a separate bill which may gain passage after consultation with industry has been completed. We do not have the amendment, but I have been assured that it will come in later tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another blow to the businesses of Australia has come with the proposed amendments contained in this bill to tax self-employed persons for the value of car parking benefits. This tax is misconceived in that it discriminates against those self-employed people who own existing car parking facilities. It also misconceives the nature of the FBT regime applying to employees. Employers will just ask their employees to put their cars in the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of FBT on car parking spaces made available to employees, the purpose of the impost is to capture the value of otherwise untaxed remuneration benefits. Accepting that the extension of FBT to employee car parking benefits is justified&mdash;and this is questionable&mdash;it does not follow that there is justification on the grounds of equity to seek to tax an attributed benefit to car parking provided by an employer to himself or herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the measures regarding car parking benefits for the self-employed amounts to a new tax on their imputed value, notwithstanding that it is based on an arbitrary measure&mdash;for example, the existence of a commercial car parking station within one kilometre of the business premises. I know of some cases in which half the premises are covered but those on the other side of the road are excluded. It is very arbitrary. The proposed provisions would appear to discriminate against taxpayers who presently incur higher costs associated with the provision of car parking than those taxpayers who have lower costs; for example, when the facility is owned outright. For this reason alone, the proposed provisions do not achieve their stated aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to repeal the concessional treatment of unused annual leave must be questioned on the grounds of equity and fairness. I welcome the government's change of heart to tax concessionally the lump sum component, but I urge it to support the opposition amendment to extend that concession to the annual leave component. The coalition is concerned about the retrospective aspect in particular. The coalition has always upheld the principle that changes in taxation should be prospective and not retrospective. The bill also covers changes to the taxation treatment of credit unions whereby the exemption from income tax for income in the nature of interest received by credit unions on loans made to their members will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to follow the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. We have yet to see the government amendment. Naturally, the opposition will not make up its mind until it sees it. About the only pleasing aspect of this bill, and the one move that the coalition does welcome, is the fact that the government has considered the lower income sections of our society and has increased the Medicare levy thresholds below which these people will not be required to pay the levy. Whilst not declining to give this bill a second reading, I support the amendments that have been moved by my colleague Senator Hill. </PARA>

Much has been said to the effect that the coalition has been obstructionist in relation to these budget bills, particularly these two. That is simply not the case, and I wish to set the record straight so that the matter can be cleared up once and for all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 August this year the government introduced its budget. In anyone's language, the legislation came in a novel form; that is, by way of an omnibus bill, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, which covered many subjects of taxation. As a result of constitutional queries, on 31 August this year the Senate referred that bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Initially, the committee was to report by 15 September 1993; however, this proved unrealistic and that date was extended to 20 September 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reporting date was set some five weeks after the budget was introduced&mdash;such was the haste and such was the importance that the coalition and this Senate attached to the review of that all-important bill. Of course, it is a matter of record now that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs worked overtime to achieve that reporting date, and indeed it did so. The unanimous decision was that there was a real risk, which was significant, that that proposed legislation could be struck down by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition went along with every measure possible to achieve a speedy review of that legislation. We did not unnecessarily hold up that legislation. We did not deliberately put this country at risk, as a lot of people in the press and the government would have us believe. In fact, the reason for the concern about that initial bill was shown in the unanimous decision of that Senate committee. The government realised this, and the result of the government's concern is mirrored in these two bills, one of which the government terms a test bill. The government realises that combining different subjects of taxation, or different impositions of taxation, is unconstitutional and risks invalidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defect was not cured entirely. These two bills were referred to the committee for further advice on 30 September this year. On 5 October this year&mdash;only five days later&mdash;the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs reported that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) should be passed and that it would stand the test of constitutional validity. However, this was only by virtue of the chairman exercising his casting vote. By no means was that decision unanimous. In fact, it was uncertain, to say the least. I would venture to say that Senator Spindler, a member of that committee, shared the view of the coalition that this bill risked invalidity. It could be seen to impose taxation on two separate subjects of taxation, as well as dealing with more than one subject of taxation, thereby inviting the disaster of having it struck down should it be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally conceded that, if enacted, the second bill&mdash;which the government agrees was drafted as a test bill&mdash;will end up in the High Court. The recommendation of the committee was that it be enacted but, again, that was not a unanimous recommendation. It was a simple majority, with Senator Spindler joining with the government senators. I say that for the record so that not only the Senate but the people of Australia can know that the coalition went along with every effort to have these bills reviewed as quickly as possible. A complete review was done from 17 August this year to 5 October&mdash;a space of some seven weeks. In that time, the government took the advice of the Senate standing committee and redrafted its budget legislation. It redrafted it because it knew that there was a potential risk of the whole budget package being struck down by the High Court as invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way in the world that this country of ours will continue to have any credibility in the eyes of the international community, nor in the eyes of its citizens, if crucial budget legislation is struck down. I hope that, in future, I do not have to say, `I told you so' because, if I have to do that, it will not augur well for the country; it will mean that one or both of these bills has been struck down as invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My opposition to these bills is primarily on legal grounds. Crucial financial provisions, such as the collection of taxes, could be subsequently ruled to be unlawful. The wine tax is a fiasco; the government thought it could steamroll the increase in the wine tax through the House of Representatives and the Senate and thereby start collecting increased wine taxes across the country. Of course, we have seen a very different picture, have we not, over the last few weeks? The increase in the wine tax, as proposed by the government, was defeated. That example is perhaps on a much more minor scale because what we are looking at here are more wide ranging bills, more wide ranging measures, which would have a more profound effect on the financial welfare of this country should they be struck down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Pat Brazil said at the hearing of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, it would take a half reasonable parliamentary draftsman a short span of time in which to redraft these bills in their proper form. I can see no reason why the government could not have put forward each measure ad seriatim, why it could not cater for each measure respectively, so that the Senate&mdash;as was envisaged in the 1890s when our founding fathers drafted the constitution&mdash;could consider each measure carefully and responsibly and then decide whether to pass or reject such measures. But, no, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was hell bent on the stand and deliver approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's petulance could be seen by the personal attack he made on the Senate committee. That attack extended to government senators. I can only say that that is indicative of the very personal way in which the Treasurer has approached this matter. It is a very subjective way in which to approach something as crucial as budget legislation when we are dealing with a country of such magnitude with people of such diverse occupations and backgrounds. It is hardly the sort of approach that one would expect from a responsible Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an Australian, I hope that these bills, if enacted, are not struck down. I hope that the fiscal nightmare that I have predicted does not eventuate. For the welfare of this country, I hope that that does not happen. But in a democracy, there are various interest groups who are quite entitled to look after their own interests and their own welfare. No doubt there will be a challenge from among the taxpayers in our community in relation to one or both of these bills, should they be enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate would not be responsible if it were simply to shrug this off and say that there is not much of a risk. In my former practice as a lawyer, if I said to a client that there was a real risk that they would lose the case, they would certainly think again before they took the case on. I am saying to the Senate: think again before we take this case on. We personally do not have anything to lose; it is Australia that has a lot to lose by any successful action in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has done everything possible to facilitate a speedy and responsible review of these budget measures; it has been in no way obstructionist. The coalition still holds to the view that these bills are potentially invalid. I have confined myself to this legal aspect because it will be of great concern to me should these pieces of legislation be struck down by the High Court. I say to the Senate: I hope that we do not have to rue the day that we passed these two bills. I hope that we do not have to look back with regret and say, `Why did we not split them up? Why did we not draft them properly? Why did we not force the matter then?' I ask those who are minded to support these bills to remember those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My opposition is not based on some churlish attitude. It is based on a genuinely held conviction that there is possibly some legal problem with these bills. I say that to the people of Australia and I say it to this Senate. More particularly, I say it to the Treasurer. Unfortunately, having regard to his past responses, it will no doubt fall on deaf ears, although I would like to think that he would put Australia first and think of this matter as a true Australian. There is only one loser should these budget bills be struck down, and that is the people of Australia. </PARA>

But, instead of properly splitting that bill, the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, insisted on having what he called a test bill&mdash;the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). This bill sought to lump together two tax measures which on their own are perfectly legal and perfectly valid, but taken together, prima facie, breach section 55 of the constitution, which requires that tax measures deal with only one measure of taxation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And at great inconvenience to the taxpayers, as Senator Watson says. So much for bill No. 2. I genuinely believe that bill No. 1 is not the result of the Treasurer's overweening ego, as bill No. 2 is. Bill No. 1 was a genuine mistake in the way that the government has lumped together with other tax measures a measure which appears to impose taxation on credit unions. I am happy to say that that is probably just a mistake. But, having been pointed out, it ceases to be negligence and starts to become arrogance and contempt when the government could easily amend this bill in the space of less than one day to put it into a constitutionally valid format. The evidence that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs heard was that it would take the Office of Parliamentary Counsel less than one day to split that bill, take out that provision and put it through separately. That is all it would have taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were not saying that the government was being arrogant or contemptuous in bringing that bill to us. But we on this side certainly say that, when the egregious mistake has been pointed out to the government, it becomes arrogant and contemptuous when it does not do anything to fix it. It is the government that lectures this Senate about fiscal responsibility. Yet, when it has an opportunity to demonstrate some fiscal responsibility through the practice of good government, do we see it do that? The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are left with only one conclusion&mdash;that this government seems to place its own self-importance and its own ego above the good of this country. We have said, `If you bring the bills forward in the proper form, we will deal with them in the proper form', but we do not believe that these bills should receive a second reading because of the form in which they are brought before the parliament. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ellison and I spent many an hour looking at this matter, trying to find any way in which the matter could be resolved. But did the government take the opportunity that was given to it? No, it did not. The government did not take the opportunity that was given to it and so we get to this situation today. We on this side of the chamber have no alternative. We do not believe in sloppy government; we do not believe that second-best is good enough. We believe that there is a way to do this, and this government should heed the advice, at least in relation to bill No. 1, of the coalition senators and Senator Spindler who are all of the view that the imposition of taxation in relation to the credit unions was prima facie unconstitutional when lumped together with those other matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even in its different form, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) is an omnibus taxation bill covering many areas of the income tax and fringe benefits tax law. The first one is the Medicare levy increase. It is normal practice to increase the Medicare levy low income threshold at every budget, and that is what we are doing. Thank goodness that for once there is something we are not fighting about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 individuals with taxable incomes of up to $12,688 and couples and sole parents with incomes of up to $21,366 will be exempt from the Medicare levy, although they will be eligible for the full range of Medicare benefits. The Democrats support this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Car parking expenses for the self-employed is another measure that is covered in Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1). We had a very long debate last year in this place on the whole notion of taxing car parking. I think we came to a sensible compromise. Last year, as a result of that debate, car parking provided to employees was made fringe benefits taxable. But, in this budget, the government is bringing in measures to make car parking for the self-employed taxable on a basis comparable to car parking for employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the equity in bringing the self-employed into line with conditions applying to PAYE taxpayers. But there are some signs that the compliance costs to employers of this tax measure will be great. We are concerned to monitor the impact of this on small business. It always raises the question of whether, when a new tax is introduced, the cost to administer that tax will exceed the cost in revenue and, therefore, whether it will be a less efficient tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to the taxation of annual and long service leave lump sums are also covered in this bill. The concessional tax treatment of unused long service leave and annual leave, paid in the form of a lump sum on termination of employment, will be removed except where the termination is a redundancy or invalidity or is under an approved early retirement scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that these changes will ensure that leave payments are taxed no differently if they are received during employment than if they are received upon termination of employment. We believe that these payments are, after all, income. We endorse the move to make the tax provisions consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that in our budget negotiations we were able to have the retrospective elements of this tax on long service leave lifted. We point to the anxiety and uncertainty created by retrospectivity. It is one thing to change a measure applying from the date of the budget; it is another thing to seek to change rules that have applied for about 30 years in order to collect some sort of windfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the remaining contentious issue is the taxation of credit unions. There are really two strong cases to be made here. The bill removes the exemption from income tax enjoyed by credit unions since 1974. Credit union income to date, in the nature of the interest received on loans to members, has been exempt from tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is arguing that this initiative will remove the competitive advantage that credit unions enjoy as a result of this tax break. It argues&mdash;I think it is true&mdash;that it is consistent with the government's general approach on tax neutrality between enterprises. Although they operate on a different commercial basis from that of banks and building societies, it is clear that some of the larger credit unions could be said to be in direct competition with these other financial institutions, particularly in the provision of housing loans and credit card facilities. It is true that the tax exemption on credit unions was never conferred so that they could be more competitive than banks or building societies in these markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, while we understand and acknowledge those arguments, we are concerned about the effect of the tax on the principle of mutuality and on the smaller parish credit unions. That principle of mutuality on its face requires that credit unions provide the socially beneficial services that banks and other financial institutions are much less interested in providing&mdash;namely, the less profitable and expensive to administer services, such as personal loans for less than $2,000 and the retention of less profitable branches in rural areas. All around us we can see banks closing in rural areas. A lot of rural Australians are concerned that the removal of this tax exemption will put great pressure on credit unions to follow the example of the banks and remove the remaining service that credit unions provide to rural Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Credit unions are able to operate without charging fees to their clients. They offer low balance accounts for clients in receipt of Department of Social Security payments. Banks are very reluctant to take on social security clients as customers or to give them loans unless they front up with the usual list of assets and liabilities. For $10, one can become a share owner and member of a credit union and secure a very small personal loan or the sorts of services that are just not available from the larger banks and some of the building societies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other distinguishing feature is that, when credit unions do the right thing and make a surplus, they use that surplus to provide services that are not available to their members through other financial institutions. For example, they run seminars on the best way to finance, and seek finance for, housing loans. They offer second opinions on the purchase of second-hand cars. They offer travel services. They make a very significant, valuable and alternative contribution to the market. The important point to make is that diversity of financial services is surely to be encouraged, not rubbed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real challenge for the government has been to find a balance to the competing arguments for and against credit unions. I do not necessarily think that the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration came up with the best suggestion, but no doubt we will deal with that when we get to the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now address the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). As the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has indicated, this is the test bill which increases rates of taxes on more than one subject of taxation. The passage of this bill will provide an opportunity for the doubts concerning the constitutionality of the original omnibus tax bill to be tested in the High Court. We heard Senator Hill move his declaratory motion. We supported it. It is the view of the Democrats that the constitutionality cloud is best dealt with by the passage of this bill and a subsequent High Court challenge, if that is what a taxpayer wishes to do to test the matter. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examined the matter. We have heard the outcome of that committee's deliberations and the Senate has acted on that tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill involves relatively minor revenue and policy questions. No serious threat to revenue arises if this bill is in an unconstitutional form. The bill also contains the following two measures: an increase in the rate of the fringe benefits tax; and a change in the taxation treatment of friendly societies. The legislation will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax from 48.25 per cent to 48.4 per cent. This restores the rate of fringe benefits tax to the top marginal personal tax rate plus the Medicare levy, following the increases in the Medicare levy on 1 July 1993. This measure will take effect from 1 April 1994, and the Democrats support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the 1994-95 income year, we will see a change in the taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations. This change will phase out the concessional tax rate for friendly societies in respect of their life insurance and certain other insurance business. In 1994-95, the tax rate will increase to 33 per cent; in 1995-96, it will increase to 36 per cent; and in 1996-97 and subsequent years, it will increase to 39 per cent. In line with this change, friendly societies will be entitled to the same deductions allowed to life insurance companies for the costs incurred in gaining the investment component of life insurance premiums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the rebate applying to the assessable bonuses on life policies issued by friendly societies will increase correspondingly to reflect the changing tax rates paid by friendly societies. The rates of rebate will be 33 per cent, 36 per cent and 39 per cent from 1 July 1995, 1996, 1997 and subsequent years. We have before us these omnibus measures. The fringe benefits tax is awaiting the deliberations of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). </PARA>

Nevertheless, it is a matter that is not a big revenue item. There were concerns so it seems appropriate that the government take a bit more time to get it right. For that reason the government does not propose to proceed with that part of this bill, but it will introduce a separate bill to deal with those provisions.

We are not exactly as one as to what those revenue implications are, but in the great order of things they are not major. The top assessment is $7 million.

There may be as many as 100, but they are not very big, they do not have many members and by definition they are very small in assets and income. That is why they will have a very small impact on revenue. My view is that had we not made this amendment, those organisations&mdash;given what they do, how they do it and what their income is&mdash;would probably have paid almost no tax.

Therefore, they ought to be entitled to see the government's amendments first. After that we ought to be entitled to consider the Democrats' amendments before we vote on them.</PARA></TALK.START>

I can see that if we proceed now an unsatisfactory result will come out of this process. An unintentional result is the usual result that flows from a failure to circulate amendments and consider them with care. The suggestion that the committee stage should be delayed until the morning is very sensible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Seeing as this has taken us a little by surprise at this late hour, it might be worth while to refresh our minds as to what has been returned. The opposition has had a clear and unambiguous position on the government's increases in wholesale sales tax from the day after the budget&mdash;that was, basically, that we would oppose them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will remember that we announced that we would oppose four either new or increased taxes that came out of the budget. The first related to the wholesale sales tax, which is the bill that is back before us tonight. The second related to the increased sales tax upon wine, which was part of this bill but the government split it and has accepted some change. That will come back to us tomorrow morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third related to accumulated long service leave and annual leave&mdash;a retrospective and appalling tax, part of which we debated a few minutes ago in the second reading stage of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) and Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). That related to long service leave. The government had given away a little earlier in this process of debating</PARA>
<PARA>the government's tax bills. The fourth related to the increase in fuel excise that the government is seeking to impose, at a penalty not only upon consumers who often can least afford it because of the prejudicial way in which the government calculated the tax on leaded fuel but also on business, in particular, which can ill-afford a further oncost at a time when there are nearly a million Australians out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition announced that it would oppose these taxes. The government sought no mandate for them at the last election. It gave no idea that it intended to increase these taxes in this way. To the contrary, it misled the Australian people by giving the impression that there would be no new taxes. The Senate will remember that income tax cuts were not a promise; they were l-a-w, law&mdash;and that is still the case, as a matter of interest. That was something that had to be implemented because the parliament had already passed the law and the Australian people were going to get tax cuts. It was hoped that that would flow through, add to incentive and provide some fillip to business and, hopefully, out of that some jobs would be created to improve the currently deplorable situation of mass unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the ledger, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said on several occasions, `We will not be increasing tax' and `There will be no new taxes'. So the Australian people voted at the last election on the basis of clear promises by this government that, in fact, taxes would come down because it would put in place the income tax cuts and there would be no new taxes. Surprise, surprise! In the budget, in breach of that promise, the government brought down these four extended areas of taxation, demonstrating that it had clearly lied to the Australian people during the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, we said we had no alternative but to attempt to keep this government honest, to at least demonstrate in the only way that we really could that we stood for at least some morality in government and in the parliamentary process in that the Australian people are entitled to not be lied to</PARA>
<PARA>during election campaigns. So, for that reason firstly, we said we would vote against these taxes. Secondly, we said we would vote against them because, as I said, at a time of mass unemployment they cannot be in the national interest. It cannot be in the national interest, in particular, to impose new taxation measures on business when business needs to grow and expand and, therefore, offer job opportunities to nearly a million Australians who are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason that we said we would vote against these taxes is that they were basically regressive. They provided an extra penalty for Australians who were less well off. A Labor government, I remind you, Mr Temporary Chairman, brought down tax bills that particularly penalised the poor. At least we on this side of the chamber, the coalition, are prepared to get out there and fight for lower taxes for the poor, as opposed to this Labor government which has the policy, it seems, of increasing taxes on the poor, having introduced a particularly discriminatory and regressive tax in that form. We said we would oppose the tax for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the history. We have not wavered from that position. Enormous pressure has been put on us from time to time to do so, but we have stuck clearly and unambiguously to that line from day one. One of those bills is now back before us, our earlier request&mdash;that is, to remove part of the wholesale sales tax&mdash;having been rejected by the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will remember that we did not get the numbers in this place to succeed in defeating the whole of the sales tax. We got the numbers only to pass a request in relation to the second tranche of the wholesale sales tax, but we sent that request to the House of Representatives&mdash;a request that the Senate be heard and that the government abandon that wholesale sales tax for the reasons that I have put. The House of Representatives&mdash;this Labor government&mdash;has rejected that request of the Senate and has sent a message back to us tonight to that effect. Therefore, what we intend to do, and what I am now doing, is pressing the request&mdash;</PARA>

I agree wholeheartedly that the avenue for the debate of these matters is not the media but the chamber, so I welcome the opportunity to explain why the Green senators have decided not to vote against the second round of sales tax increases and why we have changed our position from the one we expressed last week.

The $3 a week increase in the jobsearch allowance will start at the same time as the newstart program in March 1994; there will be a $1 per child increase to the family allowance scheme from January 1995, which is preparatory to the second round of increases; there will be a removal of the doubling of HECS for people who take longer than the prescribed time to complete study; and there will be some $2 million in emergency relief for those people who are, through voluntary agencies, requesting assistance. </PARA>

As honourable senators would be aware, on 11 November, some 76 years on, the remains of the unknown soldier will be brought home from the Western Front and laid to rest in the memorial in Canberra.

This is probably the final piece of the Australian identity being laid at a time when our identity is much questioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has acknowledged this in today's paper&mdash;and, of course, in today's Senate, translated through one of his ministers&mdash;when he was reported as saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not plan to speak tonight but I was moved to by the comments of my colleague Senator McGauran. I think the events of 11 November, which were mentioned today in the Senate, are enormously important in Australian history&mdash;the 75th anniversary of the tragedy of the First World War, a tragedy which marked many Australian families at the time. Indeed, there would barely be a person who cannot hark back to a grandparent or great-grandparent or who would not be able to at least recognise someone who at the time was marked by those particular events.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a pity, as we are at the 75th anniversary, that the commemoration of these events has not been more obvious and public. I am delighted to hear that there will be a special day on 11 November, which Mr Keating has announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw on the thoughts of General Monash. I had the opportunity to read recently General Monash's book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Victories in France, 1918</EMPHASIS>. Truly, those events mark one of the great pages of Australian history. Whereas many feature films have been produced by the ABC and other organisations which perhaps unduly tend to attack the institutions of this country, this is really a time when one would have wanted to see some major feature films on the Australian victories in France in 1918.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who reads General Monash's book cannot but be moved by the enormous achievement of the Australians which culminated, initially, in the push forward on 8 August and which broke through the German lines and destroyed a number of major German divisions at that time. It is surely one of the truly great victories. I think it is a pity that the cultural institutions of this country, of which the ABC is a major one, did not time show the enormous achievement and  courage of Australian soldiers at that time, and I hope this oversight will be fixed up on 11 November. Honour and courage do not come naturally to most people. It is a feature of those men and the women of 1914-1918 that they showed not only the great comradeship that is such an important value in Australian culture, but also enormous courage and commitment to their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a bit surprised today when Senator Collins said that, by the year 2001, maybe Australia will have its own flag. It was an enormously offensive comment to about 99 per cent of Australians and it was astonishing that it came on the day that Senator Faulkner rose in the chamber to announce the special commemorative occasion on 11 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chapter in General Monash's book on the events of 8 August, as the Australian troops pushed forward and broke through the German lines, detailed the reports which came in from the front at that time. There were hourly reports as the Australian troops moved forward. From memory, he recorded that at about 1.15 p.m. the Australian flag was raised over the French village of Harbonnieres. He wrote that he would telex the Governor-General about the great achievements of the Australian soldiers on that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators can imagine the offence that Senator Collins's comment would have caused to many people. Those men were fighting for their country. They were fighting under a flag which they were proud of&mdash;a flag which, as they moved forward and recorded a magnificent victory, was proudly raised over a French village. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the thrust of the remarks of my colleague Senator McGauran. I hope that all Australians will remember the previous generations of men and women in this country who served their country so well and so many of them who sacrificed their lives on behalf of this country. I hope the commemorative occasion on 11 November will make up for what I believe has been a fairly lacklustre memorial to the 75th anniversary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the old diggers did go to France, but I wonder how many of our school children know why they went or have any idea of their achievement or what material has been put into the hands of the children. There is time for the government to make sure that the lacklustre approach to these events is made up for. I hope that after the commemorative occasion on 11 November we will be in a position to feel that we have appropriately honoured the enormous achievements of previous generations of Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I was invited to launch what I think is a remarkable book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Policy, Private Lives</EMPHASIS>. This book is a window into another world. It is a world foreign to most Australians. It is a world inhabited by grief and hardship and struggle; a world inhabited by people whom I believe Australian society is failing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a politician it disturbs me to see that the central theme of this book is that, while politicians, governments, public servants, the medical profession and the disability service industry all trot out cosy and comforting rhetoric, there is an absolute chasm between that rhetoric and what actually goes on in these people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The book documents the failed promise of the disability rights movement that got under way in the 1970s and 1980s. It points to the fact that, for all of the talk, a lot of the parents in this situation say that there is an absence of vision, an absence of innovation, an absence of adventurous application of policies that might actually help them. At every turn they find that bureaucracies fall back on the defence that there are just not enough funds to go around. They acknowledge the competition for funds between many worthwhile causes in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that funds may be short, but what the parents, particularly the women, whose perspective this book explores, begin to conclude is that they are blocked by bureaucratic inertia, by medical establishment conservatism, by reluctance to embrace new ideas, and by a sense that their problems are just too big and too complex for the system. These parents are left to survive as best they can, and largely on their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reading this book I am moved to ask some questions. Surely the loss suffered by these women and men is enough. Surely a society should be able to step in effectively and intelligently to help lighten the load. Why can we not produce child-care reforms that really help families with disabled children? Why can financial assistance not be better targeted? Why can health care not be prioritised for women who literally break their backs with the physical effort of moving their children as they grow older and heavier or who are driven to the edge of madness? Should we not bite the bullet and honestly and openly question the extent to which medical intervention and costly technology is keeping alive babies who would in previous times never have survived?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know a lot of the parents involved have the courage to confront this issue. The question is: have the doctors? Why can the medical system not deal with parents like adults and explain all of the options honestly, directly and simply? Where are the programs to help marriages which collapse one after another under the strain of caring for these children? Why is there not a special case made to provide special housing for families that need it? Instead of just talking about the theory of integration in schools, why are education systems still so reluctant? Why are so many schools and teachers still threatened by integration? Why do we keep on applying the bureaucratic jargon of efficiency and cost effectiveness so beloved of the economic rationalists? Why do we not get back to some good old important and traditional precepts like fairness and human rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents of disabled children spend their lives racked by question and doubt. Every one wrestles daily with the theory that somehow, in some way, some good will come out of their and their child's circumstances. For some, this is a feeble notion. Others remain transfixed by the simple unfairness of their situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along the way, the children and their parents do grow. They meet some extraordinary people with great skills and commitment. They become part of loving, informal support networks. They realise that, however tough they might find their plight to be, there are others suffering more. They learn the true value of the child and they are repaid with great love. And they learn to struggle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This book has two important achievements. It sets out to link what it calls the `handicapping impact of disability on the individual and the family' with issues of public policy. I think that is lacking in our society and in our parliaments. But the major achievement of this book is to give a voice to people who for too many years have not been heard. The system&mdash;and that includes us, as policy makers, especially&mdash;must begin to listen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the authors, Dina Bowman and Melanie Virtue, and the National Council on Intellectual Disability, for persevering and publishing this book. The last two paragraphs on page 12, under the heading `The Road Ahead', state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not present any answers rather we ask questions and point to areas where change is needed. Men need to take more of an active role in caring for the family, career paths need to take into consideration family responsibilities and flexible work arrangements need to be developed, but most importantly good, well-funded and resourced</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">community support services must be available to support women and men in meeting their family responsibilities. Women in need of support must not be viewed as victims or dependants. Support systems which are flexible, responsive and accountable to women must be developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the key themes that appears throughout the women's stories is the desire for autonomy and their sense of loss of dignity and control when forced to use services that are provided as a charity. Responsive support systems should not only address the women's need for support, they should also acknowledge their right to self determination. Unless we make fundamental changes to the way in which we structure paid work, community care will continue to be a euphemism for individuals being exploited for their care and concern and the economy will continue to hitchhike on women's sense of duty and capacity for affection.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is generally accepted that a sizeable number of Burmese women are involved in prostitution in Thailand. Burmese ethnic leaders from the refugee camps in the Thai-Burma border region have told us that women from these camps may have been forced or sold into prostitution in the past, and that they are seeking to prevent this from occurring in the future. There are thirty camps for displaced Burmese people along the Thai-Burma border which accommodate over 72,000 refugees. While the Thai Government has ultimate control over these camps, Burmese ethnic group organisations administer the camps on a day-to-day basis. People are able to enter and leave the camps relatively freely and some of the camps are used as transit points for people leaving Burma to work illegally in Thailand. There have been instances of Thai job brokers entering Burmese refugee camps in Thailand to offer women in the camps jobs in Thailand. Administrators of these camps have reportedly put in place policies to restrict access to the camps to keep out job brokers and campaigns to warn women of the dangers of accepting such job offers.</PARA>

The Thai Government is currently preparing legislation on the suppression of prostitution which it plans to submit to the Thai Parliament shortly. Thai authorities have undertaken a number of raids on brothels which have resulted in a large number of Burmese women being taken into custody and charged with illegal immigration and deported. Vocational education centres have been set up in some areas of Thailand to provide elementary psychological assistance and vocational training before deportation.

The Australian Government works with the Thai Government by funding projects designed to assist Burmese women in prostitution in Thailand. The Australian International Development Assistance Bureau funds two HIV/AIDS projects which have as a major target group Burmese women in Thailand. An AIDS education program in the south of Thailand targets Burmese commercial sex workers and their clients and involves building up the capacity of the Ministry of Public Health in screening, testing and treatment. Community education, counselling and training also form part of the project. A further project, in the north of Thailand, aims to increase and strengthen outreach prevention and control of HIV/AIDS among commercial sex workers and to mobilise village support groups for the care of those already infected. The Australian Government also contributes funding of $300,000 per year to Burmese refugee camps in Thailand.</PARA>
