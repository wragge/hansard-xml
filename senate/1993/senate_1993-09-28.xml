<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to cabinet's decision to establish its budget salvage committee&mdash;or it might be better referred to as a save the discredited Treasurer committee. I ask: can the minister inform the Senate what exactly this committee will do? Is its establishment an admission that the strategy of staring the Senate down has failed? If in fact the government has abandoned its threatening pose as counterproductive, will the government now remove the linkage of income tax cuts to the passage of regressive tax increases?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee will conduct discussions with those members of the Senate who have shown some reasonableness in being prepared to consider the measures; so we will not be talking to the opposition. The staring down issue is not worth any further consideration. I want to say something about linkage. I was hoping that Senator Hill would agree to include that in his question&mdash;that was very kind of him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is linkage in three forms. It has always been absolutely clear that there is a linkage between the revenue measures in this budget. It does not matter whether or not they are in the form of one bill or separate bills with a clause indicating that one tax effect is subject to the other. Whatever legislative form it takes, nothing can take away from the fact that there is a fundamental economic linkage, which is unarguable, between the capacity of a government to deliver income tax cuts, which it thinks are justified, and the passing of the revenue measures that will make it possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been clear from budget night that that linkage exists. Those opposite have to remember that in this budget we are bringing forward these tax cuts. What I am looking forward to is the circumstance on 15 November. If the legislation passes on 15 November ordinary Australian workers will get a major tax cut; a tax cut to which they are entitled. If they do not get these tax cuts because of the intransigence of the Senate, we will have a very interesting situation. I look forward to seeing those over there, who have been responsible for holding the legislation up, talking to the ordinary office workers on $500 a week about why they are missing out on a $5 a week tax cut, or talking to a nurse on $710 a week, who is not what I call rich.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not from 15 November. The ignorance of those opposite is only being compounded by their volume. It is just another indication of quantity replacing quality in the contributions of those opposite. We have a situation where ordinary Australian workers, like nurses on $700 a week, will lose $14 every week in the tax cuts until they are passed. A bus driver will miss out on $9 a week every fortnight the Senate delays the passage of these bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to those opposite going out to those workplaces, because we will be going out there explaining to people why they are not getting those increases. People talk about these cuts somehow being a pay-off to the wealthy, but we are talking about tax cuts that assist ordinary Australian workers to get the sort of tax cut to which they are entitled. Millions of Australian workers on average earnings will miss out on the extra dollars they are entitled to in their pay packet if the Senate continues with the irresponsible and damaging political game playing which those opposite have been undertaking until now. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Last year the discredited present Treasurer promised tax cuts with no strings attached when he told the parliament, `The point is, the tax cuts can be funded without any new taxes'. Why then did Senator McMullan tell the Senate yesterday that there is and always has been a linkage between the revenue increases and the tax cuts?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are bringing forward tax cuts for those workers to whom I referred before. We are bringing forward tax cuts for those office workers, nurses, bus drivers and other ordinary workers to whom those tax cuts are targeted, who deserve them and to whom we wish to give them. Therefore, we have to consistently deal with revenue measures that would compensate for that necessary bringing forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bringing forward does one other very important thing that people do not like to recognise. The other important thing about bringing forward the tax cuts, and why we want to do it, is that they are also a very important economic stimulus. Bringing forward the tax cuts will provide an extra $300 million of expenditure. It will pump $300 million into the Australian economy before Christmas, if they are passed in time for them to take effect on 15 November. That extra expenditure starts to generate the retail sales which are good not only for the individuals who have the capacity to make it but also for the retail sector and for Australia's employment. It is an important element of economic stimulus, so we wish to be able to deliver the cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have in this budget over four years a deficit reduction strategy, which is a very important strategy. It is not an easy balance to strike to increase the deficit in the first year to generate the necessary economic stimulus and similarly over a four-year period to deliver a deficit reduction strategy which will get the deficit down to 1.1 or 1.2 per cent&mdash;very close to one per cent&mdash;of GDP. It is an outstanding achievement internationally and in the terms of Australia's macro-economic history. There are few occasions on which that has been achieved to that extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to strike a delicate balance. It may be too complex for Senator Alston, but the tax increases are necessary to fund that bring forward and to deal with the necessary deficit reduction strategy to get the deficit down to one per cent of GDP.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Friday, 24 September, was an important day for people in Cambodia. On that day they promulgated the new Cambodian national constitution, which was a vital step forward for the independence of that country. Today is equally a very important day for Cambodia. The significance of today is that for the first time the newly constituted national assembly is meeting in Phnom Penh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Australian government&mdash;and I believe I speak for the Senate in this as well&mdash;I extend my warmest congratulations to the national assembly of Cambodia in its first meeting in Phnom Penh today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This previously shattered nation has been rendered whole now, with its own democratically elected national assembly assuming responsibilities for ongoing peace and stability in that country. It means that the United Nations brokered peace process in Cambodia has achieved its primary objective of returning to the Cambodian people the responsibility for their own destiny. We acknowledge and salute this outstanding achievement of the United Nations peacekeeping force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">UNTAC's mandate formally ended on 24 September, the day on which the new constitution was promulgated. Under the constitution, Cambodia has become a constitutional monarchy, under which the monarch reigns but does not govern. Prince Ranariddh and Mr Hun Sen were appointed co-prime ministers. On the same day, Prince Sihanouk took office as King of Cambodia. The progressive withdrawal of UNTAC personnel is proceeding, including that of the Australian Defence Force contingent, and it is to be completed by 15 November this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia shares the sense of celebration and satisfaction surrounding these developments in Cambodia. It has extended warm congratulations to King Sihanouk and the two prime ministers, Prince Ranariddh and Mr Hun Sen. It should be remembered that Australia has made a significant contribution to the peacekeeping process, and the government commends all those Australians involved. Particular mention must be made of Lieutenant-General Sanderson, who has served as military commander of UNTAC with great distinction. I think particular mention should be made of foreign minister Gareth Evans for his distinguished service in helping bring about this outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of Cambodia is now in the hands of the Cambodians, but it is the nature of the peace accord that the settlement process does not end with the completion of UNTAC's mandate; rather, it is a continuing international process by which the signatories are committed in a variety of ways to assisting Cambodia.

Why is there no provision for it in this budget, which is almost devoid of public infrastructure investment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be a drop in the bucket for the Australian Democrats but we on this side of the House actually have to make the sums work. I respectfully point out to Senator Spindler that the $450 million we have put into rail in One Nation, $300 million of which will be spent this year, is one of the biggest single injections into new capital works on railways in living memory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original black spots program was announced on 5 December 1989. It was a comprehensive road safety package which was aimed at reducing the national road toll. It had a planned three year life. It was always intended that the program would expire at the end of June this year. Between 1990 and 1993 an amount of $110 million was allocated to eliminate a range of hazardous accident black spots. Funding to the states and territories was conditional on their accepting a 10 point package of enhanced road safety measures&mdash;a reduction in the alcohol limits being one of the more prominent measures. This original allocation was further boosted by an additional $110 million worth of One Nation funds and a further allocation of $60 million in the 1992-93 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This total of more than $260 million was fully disbursed to the states and territories before the planned completion of the program in June this year. The package has been fully implemented everywhere, except Western Australia and the Northern Territory, where a few aspects await final implementation. Over 3,000 identified black spots have been eliminated during the three year life of the program, which is now being analysed by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics. The report on this analysis will be completed later this year. I will make sure that Senator Spindler and indeed all senators get a copy of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the black spots program was twofold:  firstly, the program was offered as an incentive for the states to agree to national standards on 10 important road safety issues; secondly, the program was designed to demonstrate to state and local authorities the value in directly addressing known accident black spots within their funding programs. The vast majority of these black spots are on local roads or state arterial roads.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the new separation of road funding responsibilities arising out of the July 1991 meeting of heads of government, the Commonwealth's responsibility will be restricted to the National Highway and, as Senator Spindler knows, significant additional federal funds are to be distributed as untied grants. In conclusion, I do find it difficult to have sympathy for those states that demand additional road funding when they fail to spend the untied funds they currently receive on roads.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very significant that the first exhibition launched by the National Museum, since it received its budget funding for the initial development work on its site, is a travelling exhibition which has been launched in Albury-Wodonga. It is a travelling exhibition essentially featuring the Murray-Darling Basin, and it will be travelling that area for the next 18 months. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A changing people&mdash;A changing land</EMPHASIS> and is the first major travelling exhibition. It will visit a number of centres in the Murray-Darling region including, I am advised, Bendigo, Goolwa, Mildura, and will travel as far north as Toowoomba, Dubbo and Canberra.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisation of this exhibition, its development and now its travelling arrangements reflect the truly national outlook which the museum has and which we want to emphasise in its development. If it is to be a national museum, it has to be accessible to Australians wherever they are; it has to be relevant to Australians wherever they live. Each community to which the exhibition will go has contributed to the exhibition, and the displays they create with the museum about their local history and the changes in their landscapes will remain in the local community as a permanent, continuing educational resource for those communities.</PARA>

The United States has made it very clear to the Europeans that the Blair House accord, a modification of the Dunkel draft final act, is the rock bottom position for them&mdash;that they will not compromise further.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has made it clear that we support that. Australia, as chairman of the Cairns Group of fair trading agricultural countries, has underlined the significance of no compromises on the draft final act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now believe that, as I have emphasised in my direct discussions with Sir Leon Brittan and Mickey Kantor, we should build a big market access package. We think that the Blair House accord deals with only half the problem; it reduces the level of subsidy. The question of access to markets is the other half of the problem and that must be the issue that is now focused on as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only 11 weeks left before 15 December and the round concluding. Therefore, it is significant to note that as well yesterday the IMF, the World Bank and the GATT itself&mdash;through their leading spokespeople, Mr Michel Camdessus, Lewis Preston and Peter Sutherland&mdash;issued a joint statement calling for the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. They called on nations to recognise that there is so much at stake that `political hesitations and vested interests must now be put aside'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They emphasise that it is of enormous significance that these Bretton Woods organisations have come out so clearly and made their points so forcefully. This follows a joint report by the World Bank and the OECD which estimates that the value of a good outcome for the Uruguay Round&mdash;properly implemented up to the end of this century&mdash;in agricultural and industrial products alone will be worth an income boost of $327 billion to global economic activity by the year 2002. That is $16 billion more than a previous estimate. Within that figure Australia can calculate that the boost in extra income to us is about $2.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I share the sense of optimism now being generated about the round's conclusions. The important issue is that farmers in France should not be able to jack up this round and hold the world to ransom. They constitute about four per cent of the GDP of France. For France not to recognise that its economic fortunes are best served by a good outcome for the round and to cave in to a small group of vested interests and jack up this round would be the wrong outcome. It is in the interests of France and the world that we now conclude it.</PARA>

It is true that there are uranium stocks in South Africa, to the best of my knowledge, and, if they become available to the world market, as is likely, then the price of uranium is likely to fall and the prospects for all uranium producing countries are likely to be bleaker in an already overhung market.</PARA></TALK.START>

The ban on South Africa was imposed because that country formerly had an entrenched policy of apartheid in its constitution. We took part, with other countries in the world, in imposing a ban because that policy is racist and it is a fundamental denial of human rights.

One of the arrangements the government put in place for dealing with this issue was the establishment in the navy of a 008 toll-free number so incidents of sexual harassment could be reported; that is, from people who have been subject to it, confronted with it, or accused of it. That was established on Wednesday of last week. To date in the navy there have been three calls on that 008 number. That gives those opposite perhaps some indication. I will take Senator MacGibbon's question about precise numbers on notice and respond to him as soon as practicable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was deeply concerned to read about these reports, and particularly concerned to know the absolute value of them. I think it is also very disturbing to see the unedifying spectacle of the Premier Mr Kennett brawling with the Chief Justice of the Family Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of my concerns about child protection services and, in particular, my concern that there may be some substance to that report, I made it my business to contact Minister Michael John so that I could be absolutely assured that the child protection services in Victoria were not going to be reduced or in any way put in jeopardy the protection and assistance for children about to be abused or victims of abuse. I am advised by the minister, and I have his assurance, that there are no cuts in essential services in the child protection area in Victoria, and further that Victoria would be maintaining its efforts in the area of child protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Honourable senators may know that while there are cuts in the child welfare budget, these go far more to the domiciliary care arrangements for children. Minister John assures me that the emphasis in Victoria is on the protection of children through assistance to families, rather than the removal of children to institutionalised care. In fact, Minister John praised some of the initiatives of the previous Labor government in Victoria that set up some of the family intervention programs which he judges are working very well and which his government is supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August I launched the first ever national prevention strategy for child abuse. That is dependent on the cooperation of the states. At the Commonwealth-state welfare ministers meeting we obtained in-principle agreement to that strategy. In the light of these reports, I was concerned not only to establish the facts, but also to be assured that Minister John would be in a position to contribute to the national prevention strategy in the negotiations soon to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am able to advise the Senate that the next meeting of the National Child Protection Council will be in Hobart on 13 and 14 October. On the preceding day officers from the Commonwealth, states and territories will begin the work of negotiating with the states for funding for the programs and arrangements that need to be put in place for that prevention strategy. I have Minister John's assurance that Victoria will be able to contribute to that prevention program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely important that we do not lose sight of the main game here&mdash;and that is the protection of our children. There is no doubt that the prevention of child abuse is the preferred way to go. It is a very complex problem which needs multi-disciplinary programs to make sure it happens. Those things are contained in our strategy and will be put in place. Unfortunately, a lot of the abuse is best dealt with as it happens or as soon as possible after it happens; in other words, we want early intervention as well as prevention. I am very concerned, and I have made it my business to be assured by Victoria, that it is able to continue its programs for early intervention. I look forward to meeting with the national council so as to assure myself that the prevention strategy will be put in place and that Victoria will be able to meet its obligations there, too.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in question time Senator Bell asked me a question concerning recent university research which suggested that 82 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders would fail at least one unit of their degree course and that women were five times less likely than men to repay their HECS debt by the age of 30. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided me with a response which I now seek leave to have incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The answer read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) and its Impact on Access and Equity in Higher Education</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although women may repay more slowly, the level of their debt is maintained in real terms through cost of living adjustments&mdash;no real rate of interest is charged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slower repayment rate indicates that HECS is meeting its objective of being an income-contingent scheme, allowing graduates to move in and out of the work force, for example for child rearing purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While repayment rates for males and females differ, the study showed that most of the total debt (96% for men and 77% for women) will be repaid to the government. The Wran committee, which recommended the introduction of HECS, estimated that some 30% of the debt would not be repaid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The HECS scheme is recognised as a most equitable arrangement for funding higher education and a number of countries are examining the scheme for possible introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the objective of the measure of introducing 1.5 HECS under clearly defined circumstances was not primarily to achieve savings, but to establish the principle that students who have consumed their `fair share' of higher education at maximum government subsidy should be required to pay more. It needs to be recognised that a student who fails to complete his or her course and who is permitted to stay at the university, excludes another school leaver or young person from attending.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure is based on equivalent full-time student load and is not related to a `time' concept as such&mdash;students will, therefore, be able to reduce their workload if necessary without incurring the higher HECS charge;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional one half of one standard student load is already provided as a period of grace to students who may be struggling to complete;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of students whose academic progress might be expected to be slower than is customary, higher education institutions have been encouraged to advise such students to pace themselves which is possible as they need to undertake no more than 75% of a full year's load without prejudicing their entitlement to Austudy or Abstudy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under existing procedures, students who are forced to withdraw for reasons beyond their control after the census date, may apply to the secretary of DEET for remission of their debt for that semester. The draft guidelines on the changes to HECS propose that units remitted will not be counted against the student's accumulated student load.</PARA>

<PARA>I am not suggesting that the minister ought not to have set up such an advisory group. I think the veterans community will welcome the opportunity to have greater contact with the government. Senator Faulkner's wish to establish greater contact with that community is probably genuine and it is certainly long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that some years ago Senator Geitzelt set up a monitoring committee in relation to veterans matters, but for some reason that was abolished within about 12 months. There is no doubt that the veterans community has not been well served in recent times and we would welcome what is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask that the minister, in setting up such an advisory committee, add at least one other group to it. It is quite a large group and I think the minister ought to be consulting with as wide a group as possible of those interested in the veterans community. In particular, I am referring to the Vietnam Veterans Family Support Link Line, which is a large and growing group of people involved principally as carers of Vietnam veterans and who have a very special knowledge of the needs of many of the veterans and what could or should be done for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really believe that the minister needs to hear from this group as well if he is going to be well advised in relation to Vietnam veterans in particular and generally on the needs of those communities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reid has raised with me, both in correspondence and previously in the parliament, the question of the representation of the group she has mentioned again today. The question of establishing the size of any ministerial advisory council is obviously a little vexed in that one wants to be as broadly representative as possible but at the same time one seeks to ensure that the committee is contained within some sort of reasonable numerical strength that will enable it to meet regularly and be properly resourced. Obviously those questions are very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly willing to involve the group which Senator Reid identifies in some of the other consultative mechanisms I have established.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Senator Reid will appreciate that it is not possible to have all groups represented on the ministerial advisory council.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also stress to Senator Reid&mdash;and I think this is an important point&mdash;that the people who have been appointed to the ministerial advisory council have been appointed as individuals. Inevitably, of course, because nominations have been sought from major ex-service organisations, there will be a suggestion of representativeness about those who serve on the ministerial advisory council, but they have been appointed as individuals and I am sure they will approach this task with the sort of responsibility that comes with membership of such an advisory council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I cannot say that I will be able to extend the advisory council, for a whole range of reasons, including the questions of resources and of trying to maintain as representative a group as possible, I assure Senator Reid and the Senate that I will involve the group that she has mentioned, which I agree with her has an important role to play, particularly with the families of Vietnam veterans, in whatever consultative mechanisms are appropriate.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VISIT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THE UNITED STATES, THE UNITED KINGDOM, IRELAND, FRANCE AND MONACO</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to inform the Senate of the outcome of the Prime Minister's visit to the United States, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Monaco between 11 and 24 September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the visit, the Prime Minister dealt with a number of issues which will have a profound bearing on Australia's trading interests and future prosperity, on our national identity, and on how we and others see our place in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are all big questions, and it is important that we get them right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time of great fluidity in international affairs, we now face fundamental questions about the structure of the world trading system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity to secure a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round is now close at hand, but the outcome is far from assured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APEC forum, which Australia has done so much to bring forward, is now poised to develop into a valuable framework for promoting trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States Congress will soon decide whether or not to approve the North American Free Trade Agreement with far-reaching repercussions either way on the US trade policy stance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this pivotal moment in the international trading environment, it is important that Australians are fully aware of the impact that decisions about future trade structures will have on our interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At stake is nothing less than the future prosperity of our country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At stake is our capacity to provide employment for the next generation of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than ever before, Australia is on its own internationally, fending for itself in a competitive and challenging international environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we are seen internationally as a modern society with many assets to help us make our way successfully in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our recent achievements in fostering a tolerant and diverse multicultural society and in executing a series of major reforms of the Australian economy highlight our capacity to change, and to play an increasing role in regional and international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These subjects were the main thrust of the Prime Minister's discussions in each of the capitals I visited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister visited Washington at a time Australia's most pressing interests coincide with much that is prominent on the American agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future of the Uruguay Round, the development of APEC and the creation of NAFTA are all matters to which President Clinton, his Administration and the Congress are giving high priority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a very useful time to be able to put Australia's view, and to represent our interests on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the enormous stakes involved, it was important to be able to discuss with the US Administration and Congress what sort of policy and institutional framework will best maintain and strengthen the highly valuable economic linkages which now operate between East Asia, Oceania and North America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So strong have these linkages between North America and the Western Pacific become over the last decade that today there is a higher degree of trade integration among the 15 members of APEC than there is among the members of the European Community, or among the three North American economies, or among the East Asian economies considered separately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And while the United States market remains vitally important for most East Asian economies, the Prime Minister found a growing awareness in the Administration and in Congress that East Asia has also become an increasingly important market for US exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, less than a decade ago more than one third of Western Pacific exports went to the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today the proportion is less than one quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the same period the proportion of US exports which go to the Western Pacific has risen to well over one quarter, on a par with those to the NAFTA partners and well ahead of exports to the EC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the mid eighties the trend rate of growth of US exports to the Western Pacific has been three times the rate of growth of Western Pacific exports to the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This rapid trade growth in the region and the prosperity it produces would be gravely threatened, in the Prime Minister's view, if in coming decades North America and the Western Pacific went separate ways in trade and strategic alignments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister is glad to be able to report that the Clinton Administration is as convinced of the importance of the East Asia region as we ourselves have become.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister had very productive discussions in Washington with President Clinton, with Secretary of State Christopher, Defense Secretary Aspin, US Trade Representative Kantor, Treasury Secretary Bentsen, Director of Central Intelligence Woolsey and with senior Congressional leaders including Senate Majority Leader Mitchell, Senate Minority Leader Dole and House President Foley.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's meeting with President Clinton was exceptionally useful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister was impressed by the vigour, imagination and resolve with which he is going about the task of rebuilding American competitiveness and American society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We affirmed in our meeting the continuing vitality and relevance of Australia's bilateral relationship with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the great changes in the world brought about by the end of the Cold War, fundamental Australian interests continue to be engaged in our relationship with the United States&mdash;in our defence alliance, in the mutually beneficial processes of policy consultation we enjoy on a wide range of issues, and in our strong commercial ties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite our bilateral access problems, which the Prime Minister discussed with Ambassador Kantor and congressional leaders, the US market remains Australia's second biggest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the United States is the largest source of foreign investment in Australia and the most important destination for Australian investment abroad.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's meeting with the President produced three important results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, they agreed to work closely together for a successful outcome of the informal APEC leaders' meeting in Seattle in November.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This historic meeting, involving leaders of the key  Asia-Pacific economies&mdash;the fastest growing area of the world&mdash;will help define an Asia-Pacific economic community and give political authority and weight to APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The President noted Australia's vital contribution to the development of APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister was impressed by the President's commitment to the Asia-Pacific economic community, and by the unanimity with which he, his Cabinet and the Congressional leadership in both Houses and both parties expressed their conviction that the United States should assign a higher priority to its trading relations with the Western Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, they agreed that it was very important to world growth and jobs to achieve a successful and balanced outcome to the Uruguay Round by the 15 December deadline for Congress's "fast track" approval, and that any move by the European</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community to re-open the Blair House accord on agriculture would seriously jeopardise the whole Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States has pressed hard in favour of freer trade during seven long years of the GATT negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a policy stance of great value to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Prime Minister was convinced by his discussions in Washington that 15 December is a real deadline for Congress, and that, if we cannot achieve an acceptable package by then, Congress as well as the Administration will turn their attention away from global solutions to trade problems and towards more regional approaches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the President and Ambassador Kantor recognised Australia's concern about the damage that EEP subsidies cause our grain exports, and said they would make every effort to minimise the effect on Australia's interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They noted the Administration's decision to stay out of the Indonesian market as a bona fide of their sincerity in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They explained that the EEP was aimed at counteracting European subsidies, and that the only fully effective way to reduce the impact on Australia's grain exports was to conclude the Uruguay Round as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In New York, the Prime Minister addressed a meeting of the Asia Society and had a meeting with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister told the Secretary-General that Australia welcomed the new possibilities for the work of the United Nations which  have arisen with the disappearance of Cold War constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister said that, as a foundation member of the United Nations, Australia is fully committed to the ideals of the Charter and wants to see those ideals prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister noted that Australia was committed to peace keeping, with around 600 Australians serving in Cambodia, Somalia and in other operations around the globe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were also a substantial financial contributor to the United Nations, paying in full and on time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister told the Secretary-General that Australia would continue to contribute resources and ideas to the Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most recent example of this contribution is Senator Evans's document "Cooperating for Peace", examining peacekeeping and conflict resolution, which is being launched in New York this week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister also made it clear to the Secretary-General, however, that the United Nations Organisation itself had to make sure it was operating as efficiently and effectively as it could&mdash;especially in its administration and in its peacekeeping operations&mdash;if it was to maintain the international support needed to fulfil its great potential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's visit to the United Kingdom, the first by an Australian Prime Minister since 1987, provided an opportunity to help reinforce and reshape this old and still very valuable relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister had a long and productive meeting in London with Prime Minister Major.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">World trade issues were again the main theme of the Prime Minister's discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister told Prime Minister Major how much Australia appreciated the very constructive and positive role Britain has played within the EC, and more widely, in pushing the cause of freer world markets and the multinational trading system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They both underlined the importance of a successful and balanced outcome to the Uruguay Round for jobs and growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They agreed that 15 December is a real deadline for the Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They also discussed the strong and growing economic ties between Britain and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Britain is Australia's fourth largest trading partner, and our eighth largest export market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the second largest source of foreign investment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In turn, we are the fourth largest foreign investor in the UK, ranking above Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prime Minister Major and the Prime Minister agreed that there was much to build on and to develop in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They noted that an important Australia-UK trade and investment conference, to be held in Melbourne in January next year, will help to maintain the impetus for growth in our commercial relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister also spoke to Prime Minister Major about Australia's constitutional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister said publicly in London that it is not because our affections for Britain are reduced or the friendship between us frailer, or our respect and admiration for the institutions Britain has bequeathed us in any way diminished, that Australia is considering the option of becoming a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the Prime Minister also said that our friendship for Britain would be all the stronger for our becoming a republic, as any friendship is stronger for being more mature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Major&mdash;Prime Minister of a Conservative British Government&mdash;and Mr Hurd, his Foreign Secretary who was on a parallel visit to Australia, both made publicly and privately clear that the matter of Australia's constitutional arrangements is one for the Government, people and Parliament of Australia and the Queen of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They both assert, quite correctly, that the modern, mature relationship between Britain and Australia will remain quite unaffected by our moves to become a republic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister was received by Her Majesty the Queen at Balmoral Castle on 18 September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with longstanding convention, the discussion between them must remain confidential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Prime Minister is able to say he explained to Her Majesty that, notwithstanding the deep respect and warm affection felt towards her by the Australian people, there was a growing feeling in Australia that constitutional changes should be made to allow the appointment of an Australian Head of State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister outlined to Her Majesty the various steps that would be involved in such a process, including the need for a referendum to approve constitutional amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister said the Australian Government's view was that, if approved by the Australian people at a referendum, it would be appropriate for Australia to become a republic by the centenary of Federation in 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister told Her Majesty that, in such a situation, Australia would remain a member of the Commonwealth of Nations, and that the Australian people would warmly welcome visits to Australia by Her Majesty as Head of the Commonwealth and as the Queen of the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her Majesty authorised the Prime Minister to say that she would, of course, act on the advice of her Australian Ministers, as she always has, and on any decision made by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issues involved in the creation of a Federal Republic of Australia are complex.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They require thoughtful and informed debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But as a result of the Prime Minister's discussions in Britain it is clear that, whatever the outcome of the debate in Australia, whatever the form of constitutional arrangements on which the Australian people finally decide, both Her Majesty and the British Government regard these arrangements, properly, as entirely matters to be decided by the Australian people themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it is also clear that the results of any constitutional changes are not seen as a threat&mdash;and will not threaten&mdash;the warmth of the relationship between Australia and Britain, or the personal respect and affection in which Her Majesty is held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's firm intention, Mr President, to ensure that, throughout the period that Australians are debating new constitutional arrangements, our existing links with the monarchy are maintained and exercised with dignity and respect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that regard, the Prime Minister is pleased to announce that he discussed with Her Majesty an invitation he has extended to the Prince of Wales to visit Australia early in 1994 following proposals by several State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The invitation has been accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Royal Highness will arrive in Sydney on 25 January, and visit, in addition to New South Wales, Tasmania,  Western Australia and Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's visit to Ireland enabled him to mark the very important contribution which Ireland has made to the cultural, social and political development of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people-to-people links between us are still strong and vigorous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Dublin the Prime Minister had the honour of addressing the Dail, and he had extensive discussions with the Taoiseach, Mr Reynolds, and leaders of the other Irish political parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's discussions focused again on the outcome for the Uruguay Round, on which Ireland has been one of the European countries most resistant to change in the area of agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister put the view forcefully to Irish political leaders, and to business people at a dinner hosted by the Irish-Australian Business Association, that Ireland, with its growing industrial exports, will be best served by ensuring that we get an acceptable outcome to the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That in turn depended, the Prime Minister said, on the integrity of the Blair House accord on agriculture being fully maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister also made the point that, although our trade is growing, the warmth of people-to-people relations between Australia and Ireland is not matched by our commercial links.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister said he hoped that companies in each country would increasingly use the other as a base to develop links into Asia and Europe respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The warmth displayed by the Irish people towards the Prime Minister as head of the Government of Australia was quite profound.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all parts of the country the Prime Minister visited, there was a spontaneous expression of warm welcome and good wishes towards Australia and the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite a phenomenon that the cultural and emotional links between Australia and this small country in Europe exists as strongly as they do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is something Australians should value and continue to nurture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the Prime Minister's way from Ireland to Monaco for the Sydney Olympic bid, he stopped for several hours in France and visited Villers-Bretonneux, the site of the memorial to the 46,000  Australians&mdash;18,000 without a known grave&mdash;who died on the Western Front during the First World War.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like all who have visited the military graveyards of France, the Prime Minister was reminded of the courage and devotion of those young Australians who fought and died in that terrible war and the huge loss this nation suffered on the French battlefields.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister was also reminded that the tragedy of which they were victims arose, in large part, from the selfish and narrow nationalism which has so often scarred this century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have the opportunity, as the century ends, to do things better, to create broader, more inclusive economic structures which will generate new growth and new jobs around the globe by maximising trading opportunities for all countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the international community fails in its efforts to resolve the Uruguay Round by mid-December, there are other options available but, as all those the Prime Minister spoke to on his visit agreed, they are not such good options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The International Olympic Committee's decision to award the Olympic Games for the year 2000 to Sydney was a wonderful outcome for this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Olympics are bound to be a marvellous moment in the life of the city and the nation: a celebration of international youth and sport in a young country with extraordinary sporting traditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of Australia's attractions will be on show to billions of people around the world as we approach the centenary of the Commonwealth's creation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Olympics can also be a defining moment in our history&mdash;in the one hundredth year of our nationhood, a brilliant opportunity to celebrate our achievements and define our place in the region and the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Olympics will generate economic growth and jobs well beyond Sydney itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IOC's decision was a tribute to all those who worked so hard to put together an outstanding bid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister and Mrs Keating were delighted to participate in the bid's presentation to the IOC, and were gratified that the Government was able to indicate its material support for the bid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a tribute to the breadth of support for the Games among the Australian community&mdash;demonstrated so memorably by the tens of thousands of people who showed their  enthusiasm in Sydney on Friday morning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a wider sense, Mr President, the IOC's decision is also a tribute to the society we have created here&mdash;its social equity, cultural diversity, tolerance and its sophistication and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney's approach was set apart from others by its technical excellence and by its commitment to the athletes themselves and to the ideals of the Olympic movement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the people involved in the bid deserve the warmest congratulations and thanks of this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than that, Mr President, they deserve the continuing support of all Australians&mdash;government, business and the community&mdash;in the seven years of hard work that still lie ahead of us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister can say on behalf of the Commonwealth Government that they will have that support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister began by stating that his visit to the United States and Europe took place at a time of great consequence for the world economy&mdash;a time when new patterns are being created, and when great decisions are being formed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the next twelve weeks alone we will have the first meeting of the leaders of the Asia-Pacific economy community, we shall enjoy success or suffer failure in the Uruguay Round, and we will have, by the year's end, a surer sense of whether recovery can take hold in Europe and Japan, and strengthen in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a decisive time in world economic affairs, Mr President, and it comes as Australia is achieving greater international recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sydney's Olympic win reflects this most dramatically, but it is also reflected in Mr Clinton's generous praise of Australia's role in forging APEC, and in the respect accorded to Australia's views in the Uruguay Round as the leader of the Cairns group of fair agriculture traders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a responsibility on all of us to recognise that we are in a bigger game&mdash;a game with bigger prizes but with new and tougher rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world is offering us great opportunities, but to take advantage of them we must continue to be flexible and competitive at home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must continue to seek national cohesion and strength.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot seize the opportunities the world offers us if we cannot agree on the fundamental instrument of national economic policy, the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot seize those opportunities if we cannot reach a satisfactory and enduring agreement on the implementation of the High Court's decision to recognise a form of Aboriginal title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot seize those opportunities if our workplace relations are not free to evolve towards outcomes based on bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To seize those opportunities we need to renew our commitment to change, and our commitment to the reforms necessary to meet the imperatives of the new global order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will help us in this regard if we recognise the success of the changes we have already made&mdash;how well we are doing in the world;  how much more competitive we have made ourselves;  how much the chances which now present themselves are only chances because of the changes we have made; how we have made them while also making Australia a tolerant, sophisticated and progressive society with few equals in the world&mdash;and how much better we can make it if we put aside sectional interest and parochialism and work together as a nation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the development of a new corporate structure specifically tailored to the needs of small business would have significant advantages, including, in particular, a reduction in running costs and greater simplicity of operation for business.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the important and wide ranging recommendations made by the Committee, I propose, as a matter of priority, to seek the views of interested organisations, especially the small business community, on the detailed proposals made by the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the notice given by the government with regard to the minister seeking views from the business and professional communities with respect to close corporations. The Australian Securities Commission has been doing this of recent weeks. A fortnight ago I attended the seminar it arranged in Tasmania. It invited business people, accountants and commercial lawyers. We had an excellent seminar on this very topic. The feeling of that meeting was that we should avoid an additional act for the close corporation and that we should amend the corporations law and arrange to have a private company as recommended by the committee. I welcome this move by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities that presented the report that the government has now responded to. I look forward to seeing its response in detail. However, recent announcements from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) indicate that the government will be going down the line of the committee's report. As Senator Gibson has quite correctly said, we wanted to have a close corporations act which would not further complicate the corporations law and would not broaden it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the evidence we received from the business community in our public hearings, there was no doubt that there is still an overwhelming feeling amongst the business community broadly&mdash;both the major corporations and the small business sector&mdash;that the corporations law remains far too complex in Australia. The overwhelming demand for a close corporations form of legislation and private company type body comes from the fact that the law is far too complicated. It is very hard to deal with corporations law in Australia unless one has extremely good, highly expensive legal advice. That does not help us in terms of being competitive internationally or in terms of formation of capital and raising capital for new business ventures. We must remember when we are focussing&mdash;particularly towards the year 2000&mdash;on trying to make Australia competitive in South-East Asia and the Asia-Pacific basin broadly that the corporations law is a very crucial part of comparative advantage amongst nations in this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporations committee travelled to New Zealand recently and found that New Zealand is just about to enact its new corporations law. Its corporations law is far more based on the US model; it is far less onerous in a regulation sense on the business community and relies far more on what we call `fuzzy law'&mdash;broad principles&mdash;than does the Australian law, which was broadly seen across the Tasman from the New Zealand perspective as far too onerous, far too rigorous and imposing upon the business community a far too complex legal infrastructure in terms of corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to reading the government's detailed response. The Attorney-General has made the right noises about the close corporations legislation. It has been sitting as an unproclaimed act for many years&mdash;since about 1989&mdash;and it is probably good that it was not proclaimed back then. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Cooney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 17 February 1993 to the former Attorney-General enclosing a copy of the Committee's overview Report entitled `The Cost of Justice&mdash;Foundations for Reform'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I generally support all the recommendations but note that they advocate more monitoring and public discussion, including an ongoing reference for the Committee, rather than making any concrete recommendations for reform and improvements to the administration of justice in Australia. I understand that future reports proposed by the Committee will address specific issues identified in the first report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My specific comments on each of the recommendations are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1. The Committee recommends that the Senate provide the Committee with a continuing reference enabling it to monitor and report annually on specific initiatives undertaken to increase access to, or reduce the overall cost of, justice, and on the cost of justice generally.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response: Supported, though this a matter for Parliament to decide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2. The Committee recommends that each court, tribunal, legal professional association, legal aid body, law school, legislature and relevant government department report annually and publicly on what that organisation has done to increase access to, or reduce the overall cost of, legal services and litigation. In the context of the recommendation in paragraph 34, the Committee will be examining these reports.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS>: Agreed. The Attorney-General will write to the key organisations referred to in the recommendation urging that they implement this recommendation. As a result of an earlier recommendation of the Senate Estimates Committee, the Attorney-General's Department, the federal courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal already include a section on Access to Justice in their annual reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3. The Committee recommends that the Australian Bureau of Statistics collect and publish, on a continuous basis, statistical material relevant to the legal profession and the operation of the legal system in Australia. The Australian Institute of Judicial Administration should analyse, assess and prepare reports on this information.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: The Australian Bureau of Statistics already has a range of initiatives underway to expand the collection of statistical material relevant to the legal profession and the operation of the legal system in Australia. This includes updating the l987-88 survey of the Legal Services Industry and possibly conducting similar surveys in future years, but not annually. The Bureau has indicated that it is prepared to discuss any additional collection requirements over and above those already proposed for the legal profession. The recommendation has also been referred to the Board of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration for its consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4. The Committee recommends that it have responsibility for convening a regular legal forum, open to the public, at which representatives of those groups having a significant influence on the administration of the law and the legal system might exchange ideas and proposals for its improvement.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: Supported, though this is a matter for the Parliament to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I wish to emphasise the importance I place on the role of the Committee not only to monitor change, but to act as a catalyst in shaping public opinion and adding support to existing proposals for reform of the justice system generally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, as indicated in a letter from the Attorney-General, the Hon. Michael Lavarch MP, to Senator Barney Cooney, the chairman of the committee, is to be welcomed. It is not to be judged by its length. No committee can complain when the relevant minister agrees, by and large, with all the recommendations made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation of that committee was that it be given an ongoing reference to monitor and report annually on specific initiatives undertaken to increase access to justice or reduce the overall cost of it, and on the cost of justice generally. That recommendation is supported by the Attorney-General. He wisely points out that in the end it is a matter for the Senate as to whether it chooses to give its standing committee that ongoing reference. I certainly hope that all members would support such an ongoing reference to the committee. The reason for that is perfectly simple. I presume it is obvious to everyone so it will not take much to elucidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I really care to say is this: we all know that, unless we are very rich or very poor, the opportunities for us to enforce our rights are simply not there. We call them rights, as though we can have them as of right. But, if we do not have the money, we cannot get them. It is a ludicrous situation that is getting worse and worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are not the sorts of sexy law reforms or policy initiatives that are ever likely to hit the front pages. On a one-to-one basis, people do not care about the cost of justice until they need access to it, and then they cannot afford it. It is then that they realise how expensive it is, and they join the band of people who realise what a deplorable situation we are in. It is not something that all Australians appreciate will, in the end, touch them in a very real way. Unfortunately, we have to wait until they are burnt by the legal system, or locked out of the legal system, for them to appreciate that point. Nonetheless, I am pleased that the Attorney supports that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second recommendation was that the committee would contact each of the bodies that might have some influence in this area, and they are very wide-ranging. The cost of justice is not a problem that has been created by one particular group. We play a part in it as a parliament; state parliaments play a part in it; the legal profession plays a part; the judges play a part; and some consumers, who think the justice system should be there as of right for them to access willy-nilly, also play a part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sorts of groups included in this exercise would be courts, tribunals, legal professional associations, legal aid bodies, law schools, various state governments and state government departments. What we want to do is get those people to simply indicate on an annual basis what they have done in the past year to increase access to justice or to reduce the cost and what they intend doing in the forthcoming year. It is a pretty simple exercise. It is not some expensive exercise in either time or dollars. It is just a simple report on what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this recommendation is to encourage those groups to focus on what they could do. Every little change mounts up in the end to a massive change across the board. So the purpose of this recommendation is to encourage a continual level of change, albeit at a small pace, and to focus the minds of those groups on the need to do something each year to increase access or reduce the cost of justice. In respect of that, the Attorney says that he agrees and indicates that he will write to some of these key organisations recommending that they go along with and implement that recommendation. The sooner those letters are sent the better, and I warmly commend that response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third recommendation related to collection of statistics on the cost of justice by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Attorney had some things to say. He basically indicated that some statistical material is already collected. The bureau has indicated that it is prepared to discuss what else it could do to get better information. That recommendation has also been referred to the board of the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration for its consideration. So at least there is something happening on that front. What will happen in the end has not been resolved, but at least there is agreement that it is a sensible proposal put forward by the committee so that people in the future have some figures available to them on which they can base policy decisions. Hopefully, in the end this will result in a decrease in the cost or an increase in the access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last recommendation made by the committee was that it be given the responsibility of convening a regular legal forum, open to the public, at which representatives of the groups such as those I have just mentioned have the opportunity to exchange their ideas and proposals for improvement. The basis of that recommendation was that it simply is not enough to have individual groups considering these things in isolation. In the end, we will maximise the contribution of each of those groups if they can come together and exchange their views. Often it may be that the procedural activity engaged in by one organisation and the reasons they have not changed in one way or another actually relate to a misunderstanding as to what some other group that they work with requires of them and expects of them. So, if we can organise an exchange of views, it will be very productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney indicates that he supports that recommendation, although he again comments that in the end it is a matter for parliament, including obviously the Senate, to decide whether it would be happy to have such a forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the Attorney on his relatively speedy response to the committee's report and on what he has said in his response. Last but not least, I urge all honourable senators who have not yet had the time to get a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Cost of Justice&mdash;Foundations for Reform</EMPHASIS>. This is not an isolated issue that can be targeted to a particular group. In the end the cost of justice affects everybody. In my view, all parliamentarians should at least spend some time perusing this report to see what contribution they can make towards implementing its recommendations and, for that matter, facilitating its spirit. </PARA>

<PARA>This is a motion to refer the question of the government's proposed tax increases on credit unions to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Those proposed tax increases are contained in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. They were formerly within the omnibus bill that the government has withdrawn and redrafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that the industry has successfully, from our perspective, made a case for a Senate committee to examine the government's proposal in this regard. My understanding is that the government's argument for increasing taxation on credit unions is to ensure equity in taxation with building societies. The industry believes that that argument is simplistic because credit unions are structured in ways other than those of building societies. So simply to affect one aspect of business, that is the taxation practice, would not achieve equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specifically, it is pointed out that credit unions do not have the same equity raising capacity that building societies have. Being under different legislation, building societies are able to seek capital through share issues in a way that credit unions are not. Therefore, credit unions have to rely on building up capital out of profit and the taxation on their profits becomes of greater consequence than it is in relation to building societies. The industry argues that one cannot simply equate building societies to credit unions and say that if one provides a similar tax regime then each is being treated fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That argument certainly warrants careful consideration by a Senate committee. The response of the committee might well be that the legislation under which credit unions are constituted should be changed so that they have the same equity raising capacity as building societies. I do not know whether that will be the response of the Senate committee, but it is obviously one option that might be open to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter could be debated in this chamber but the careful analysis that is necessary of such issues is difficult to be achieved through a debate in this place. Senate committees in the past have demonstrated that they are able to produce information upon which the Senate is able to make a better judgment. Thus, I think this matter warrants that sort of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other argument that is put these days is that there are some similarities between building societies and very large credit unions. In fact, many credit unions are of a fundamentally different nature from building societies. I am speaking of the hundreds of smaller credit unions that are often linked to particular industries or particular regional or country towns which are set up on the principle of volunteerism. A small community or employees within a particular industry join together with no profit motive, of course, but to help to provide credit to each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about structures that are fundamentally different from building societies. Because they are small and are often in regions of Australia that are suffering, particularly at the moment, from the recession or the aftermath of the recession, they are vulnerable. Therefore, it has been put to us that many of these small credit unions that fulfil worthwhile community services will not be able to sustain this new taxation regime, which, as I said, is really a taxation regime that has been applied to a fundamentally different type of credit provider, a large and strong building society and one that is able to raise capital through other means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these representations, which we in the coalition certainly believe warrant further and careful consideration by the Senate, I gave notice of this motion to refer the bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration for inquiry and report on or before 28 October 1993. I really chose the date on the basis of what seemed reasonable to allow the committee to do its job properly. In effect, what I was seeking was approximately a month. It seemed to me that that was warranted because there are so many credit unions in distant parts of Australia and they are often small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that they should have an equal opportunity to contribute to this parliamentary process, if that is their wish. To communicate with them, to give them the opportunity to make a submission and to become part of that process, of necessity, takes time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has to have time to consider those representations, to consider the complex issues of law and taxation and to report back to this Senate. We heard from Senator McKiernan yesterday, in relation to one Senate committee, that he felt the time allowed for consideration of the complex issue of the constitutionality of this package was insufficient for the committee to have done its job in the way that he would have liked it to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger in making these references too short is that the work that is done perhaps is not of as high a quality as the Senate has a right to expect. On the other hand, we all know that some committees have considered matters for a long time. Therefore, it seems to me that it was necessary to have a tight time frame. I am also conscious of the fact that for this chamber to deal with the bill it would need the committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be anxious to deal with the government's taxation package at least within the usual time frame for dealing with such legislation. I am advised that the normal time frame for taxation bills arising out of a budget is that they get into this chamber about mid-October. Therefore, it seemed to me that it was not unreasonable for this committee to report by 28 October. The date has been chosen as a balance between, on the one hand, the need for the committee to expedite such a hearing but, on the other hand, a desire for the committee to have sufficient time to do justice to the industry and ensure that its work is of the standard that we require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In relation to the terms of reference, I have mentioned that, in order to do the job properly, the committee should look at the role played by credit unions in Australia, in particular their structure, operation and community service. By that, I mean the way in which they operate compared with building societies and other credit providers. I am conscious that in many small towns the history of recent times has been that banks have been leaving those towns. They are generally not served by building societies and the credit union is actually becoming more important in the provision of consumer credit than was once the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the committee should also look at the history of the partial tax exemption that the government is seeking to remove. Further to what I said a minute ago, it should look at the treatment of this particular industry in relation to capital formation and the capacity of the industry to continue to provide the financial and community services that it has provide in the past. It should compare the taxation treatment with other like bodies, if they can be identified as like bodies. Basically, the committee should give advice to the Senate as to whether there are still reasons for the differentiation of tax treatment between credit unions and building societies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put this reference to the Senate today as a constructive effort to better inform the Senate on what is an important but nevertheless difficult issue in order that the industry and communities most concerned by this new taxation proposal of the government can be properly brought within the parliamentary process. This chamber needs to be fully informed so that its final determination in relation to the bill can be based on sound evidence and careful consideration, rather than what is sometimes the case&mdash;insufficient deliberation simply because of the nature of the conduct of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thing I find most passing strange about this motion dealing with the taxation treatment of credit unions is that it is being moved six weeks after the measure was announced in the budget. It presents all sorts of timing problems. Therefore, the government is not an enthusiastic supporter of referring this particular matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration now, because there are timing factors associated with the budget bills. The timetable that Senator Hill has laid down may make those timing issues very awkward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into the question of how the bills are linked or even try to untangle it all in my mind, although I might address that in half an hour's time in another place. The advice that Senator McMullan, who represents the Treasurer in this place, has given me is that we would have a timing problem with the report back date of 28 October. I therefore intend to move an amendment to omit 28 and substitute 18. I am under absolutely no illusion about the pressure that that date will put on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, I believe that this chamber is abrogating some of its responsibilities to committees and that committees are not able to fulfil their obligations, from a resource point of view, from a timing point of view and, regretfully, from an intellectual capacity point of view. This has been reflected in some of the weaker reports that we have seen coming back from committees to this chamber over the past few months. That is to do not with a lack of diligence on the part of senators, but simply because of time constraints and massive workloads as more and more stuff is referred to committees. One only has to look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for today and the last few days to know how much extra work is being moved over to committees from all over the place. </PARA>

<PARA>It is evident from its terms that this motion relates to a declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt, Mr Duffy, under section 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, often referred to as the HREOC act. That declaration was with respect to the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of that ministerial declaration was, subject to its not being disallowed by either the House of Representatives or this chamber, to bring the rights and freedoms recognised in the UN declaration within the definition of human rights in the HREOC act and the general functions of the commission with respect to human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to make perfectly clear that the UN declaration has laudable objectives. It recognises that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and that no-one should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. However, the action of the former Attorney-General has given rise to grave concerns among a wide range of religious groups and members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many, including archbishops, bishops and representatives of a range of christian and non-christian groups, have written to honourable members and senators. The main concern expressed by those people contacting senators and members has been that the effect of the incorporation of the UN declaration into the definition of human rights in the HREOC act will not be to protect religious freedom in Australia but to limit it. That is the concern that has been expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members and senators have received hundreds of submissions from around Australia in relation to this particular UN declaration on religious freedom, and equally on the Attorney-General's declaration to put the United Nations declaration under the HREOC act. Those submissions, letters and telephone calls have disclosed close to a total lack of understanding among members of the public of the real impact of Australia's adopting a United Nations declaration and the means by which United Nations declarations and conventions can become part of the domestic law of Australia. It is sad that the submissions display a pretty broad and general lack of understanding and knowledge about the impact of Australia adopting UN declarations and the means by which those declarations and conventions in other circumstances can become part of domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of even greater concern, however, is that these submissions have also disclosed an alarming lack of knowledge about the role and powers of the commission. It is a body which, under the first version of the budget&mdash;I think we are now up to budget mark 3 and we might have mark 4 pretty soon; perhaps we will get up to the accord numbers&mdash;has been allocated funds of over $17.7 million for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key misunderstandings reflected in those hundreds of submissions received by senators and members is to the effect that the adoption of this declaration under the HREOC act makes the declaration law, as it were, in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition accepts that the ministerial declaration does not of itself make the UN declaration part of Australia's domestic law. The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens, as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of a human rights commissioner as contained in the HREOC act in relation to investigating conduct that might constitute a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies. Accordingly, it is important to note that some of the strong fears that have been voiced, and in particular those which suggest that the UN declaration operates to curtail the religious freedom of individuals, are difficult to sustain. Despite the fact that those concerns are difficult to sustain, there are compelling reasons why the former Attorney-General's declaration should still be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to put this matter into context. On 7 December 1962, the General Assembly of the United Nations initiated the preparation of a draft declaration and a draft convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance. However, it was not until 1981, after 19 years of tortuous drafting and negotiation and renegotiation, that the declaration was finally adopted. Therefore, it was 19 years in the making, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In UN practice, a declaration by the General Assembly is usually a step in the process towards settling a convention or treaty, but a convention on the elimination of all forms of religious intolerance has yet to be finalised, even though it is now almost 31 years since drafting was initiated. The delay in finalising the declaration and the apparent inability of the United Nations to agree upon the terms of a convention reflect not only political struggles that may exist within the United Nations but also, particularly, the controversy that is inherent in this subject matter and the difficulty associated with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Attorney-General's actions, however, deserve some closer scrutiny. It is important to look at the circumstances under which the former Attorney-General put his signature to the declaration under the HREOC act. The United Nations declaration was adopted by a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations in November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Australia supported the resolution in 1981, it was not until 1993&mdash;nearly 12 years later&mdash;that the former Attorney-General made this declaration under the HREOC act. The date on which it was done is also instructive. It was 8 February this year; the day after the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced the federal election. The day after the government decided that it was time to have an election, to go to the people to seek a reindorsement of its mandate, the former Attorney-General, nonetheless, decided that it was appropriate to make this declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months before that, the former Attorney-General had consulted with state governments. It may not be very well-known publicly that Attorney-General Hannaford of New South Wales advised the former Attorney-General that the New South Wales Liberal government opposed the incorporation of the UN declaration into the HREOC act, and so did Attorney-General Berinson, QC, of the West Australian Labor government. So attorneys-general from a Liberal government in New South Wales and a Labor government in Western Australia, when consulted a few months prior to this declaration being made by the former Attorney-General, opposed the declaration being incorporated under the HREOC act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to hear from the minister an explanation as to why, despite the fact that two state governments were consulted and had a different view to put, one day after an election is called it is seen as so essential to incorporate this declaration, which is not a convention, under the HREOC act&mdash;some 12 years after we have agreed to it and 31 years after the whole ball started to roll. What prompted the former Attorney-General to sign this declaration 10 years after the matter had come before his government, on the day after the federal election was announced&mdash;an election which even Labor members were expecting to lose? That is the obvious question. An Attorney-General expecting not to be Attorney-General after the election decided at that point to make this declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might look at the nature of the document to see whether that can give us any indication as to why the former Attorney-General would proceed on this path and also look at the incorporation of the UN declaration in the HREOC act to see what we can find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that one might want to make is that the UN declaration is not a treaty. Australia is not bound at international law to comply with the terms of the UN declaration; nor is it bound to incorporate its provisions into Australian domestic law. Its adoption in 1981 means little more than that the principles sought to be stated in the declaration were accepted by Australia as a step in the process of endeavouring to reach a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination. One might look then to see whether, by making this declaration, by putting this United Nations declaration under the HREOC act, one would be satisfying some sort of lack of power under the HREOC act, existing as it does now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to be made is that, within the existing definition of human rights in the HREOC act, the commission has ample power to promote the concept of religious freedom and to investigate infringements of that freedom by the Commonwealth or its agencies.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are significant statements on the right to freedom of religion and belief in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That argument is fairly simple. Significant statements on the right to freedom of religion and belief have already been incorporated into the definition of human rights in the HREOC act. They are so incorporated because the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is already an appropriate instrument under the HREOC act. Articles 18(1), (2) and (3) of the international covenant state that everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and belief, and the right to manifest that religion or belief. They state that no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair those freedoms. This is virtually identical to article 1 of the UN declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the definition of human rights in the HREOC act in relation to religious freedom does need extending, no justification for such extension has been offered by the government at any time. If a case were to be made, the legislation affecting the extension should be done in the most clear and readily comprehensible language. The UN declaration in relation to religious freedom does not have those qualities of clear and readily comprehensible language, as I will demonstrate with some examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could argue that it lacks clarity of meaning. I believe that the UN declaration is a document in which clarity of meaning has been sacrificed for the sake of compromise. That is no surprise, given the length of time it has taken to develop. The result is a series of vague, ambiguous and potentially contradictory provisions. The declaration contains general provisions that state that everyone will have the right to freedom of religion or belief and to manifest that religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching and that no-one shall be subject to coercion which would impair his or her freedom to have a religion or belief of his or her choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration goes further than that and in article 6 expressly states what those freedoms include. It is worth quoting a few of them. One freedom is to establish and maintain appropriate charitable or humanitarian institutions. What, one might ask, is an `appropriate charitable institution'? Another function is to make, acquire and use to an adequate extent the necessary articles and material related to rites or customs of a religion or belief. What is `an adequate extent'? What, we might ask, are `necessary articles and material' as opposed to unnecessary ones? One might suggest, for example, that a sacrificial dagger is, according to some rites, a necessary article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 6 specifies a right to write, issue and disseminate relevant publications in these areas and to teach a religion or belief in places suitable for these purposes. What are `relevant publications' in this context? What constitutes a `suitable' place in which a religion or belief may be taught? Another purported right is to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief. Who constitutes an `appropriate leader'? We have seen recent examples of totally inappropriate leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions are an attempt to codify to some degree religious rights and freedoms, but they give rise to a multitude of questions of interpretation. It is difficult to see how the commission could fulfil its functions of promoting understanding and acceptance of these alleged human rights. To give any meaning or content to them, the commission would have to engage in value judgments in respect of which the UN declaration offers no guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the lack of clarity of meaning in the declaration, there is possible conflict. The provisions of the declaration probably conflict with the provisions of instruments already incorporated into the HREOC act. There is probably also internal conflict between provisions of the UN declaration itself. An example is provided by provisions dealing with the religious education of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the covenant first, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that the state parties to the covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. That is article 18(4) of the international covenant. There is a similar principle stated in the declaration on the rights of the child, which is also incorporated into the HREOC act in principle 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar vein, article 5(1) of the UN declaration provides that the parents and legal guardians of children have the right to organise the life within the family in accordance with their religion or belief and bearing in mind the moral education in which they believe the child should be brought up. However, article 5(3) of the UN declaration provides that the child shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship among peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, respect for freedom of religion or belief of others and in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parent concerned to educate his or her child in accordance with the parent's religious commitments could well find that the tenets of his or her religion are not in conformity with those latter requirements. In fact, article 5(3) of the UN declaration itself is almost an expression of a form of religious belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparently absolute rights given to parents in the international covenant to ensure that the religious and moral education of their children is in conformity with their own convictions are also inconsistent with article 5(2) of the UN declaration. The latter states that whilst every child shall enjoy the right to have access to education in the matter of religion or belief in accordance with the wishes of his parents or legal guardian and shall not be compelled to receive teaching in religion or belief against his wishes, the best interests of the child are the guiding principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be suggested that the use of the term `the best interests of the child' opens the door for the overriding of parental wishes in relation to the religious education of their children. Apart from its specific terms, the declaration also raises the broader issue of governments legislating with respect to religious freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the most noble acts in history have been done in pursuit of an article of faith or a religious ideal. On the other hand, some of the most ghastly and inhuman chapters of history, even the very recent history, have also been the result of uncompromising beliefs of a religious nature. It is also a fact that there are many religious practices and beliefs which are not acceptable to the vast majority in Australian society. In this respect, I am not particularly thinking of choice of diet, dress or hygiene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some religions promote unacceptable practices involving mutilation of the body. In societies observing other religions, females are accorded inferior status and rights. Indeed, religious beliefs and practices which effectively make women and children second class citizens almost certainly conflict with existing equal opportunity and sex discrimination legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the coalition opposes the former Attorney-General's declaration for several reasons. First, the HREOC act already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. The case for further statement has not been made. Another statement is unnecessary. Secondly, the history of the UN religious declaration demonstrates the difficulties inherent in its subject matter. As a result of these difficulties, the UN declaration is vague and possibly internally inconsistent, and its impact is unclear, especially, as I say, in relation to those religions whose practices involve, for example, mutilation of the body or the allocation of an inferior status and set of rights to females in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some courses of action that the government could and should take. First, the government should amend the HREOC act to allow for the examination of international instruments prior to their being declared in relation to the other functions of the commission. If that exercise had been engaged in, perhaps some of the misunderstandings that we freely acknowledge do exist with respect to the concern in the community would not be there. It is not good enough to simply take an elitist approach and say, `We know that these people do not understand the exact nature of this. We know what is good for them, and we are going to proceed'. It would have been appropriate to resolve those misunderstandings, that misinformation and that lack of knowledge in the first instance. There is no rush, as we say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HREOC act already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. Therefore, there was plenty of time for the government to make its case as to why an additional instrument relating to religious freedom should be incorporated under the HREOC act&mdash;and the government did not do that. So perhaps as a first step it would be appropriate to ensure that there is proper examination of international instruments prior to their being declared under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government should undertake to educate the people of Australia about the role of the United Nations, its role in Australia and the impact of its various instruments on Australian law. The Attorney-General's Department does understand the role of the United Nations; I have no doubt about it. Plenty of people in the community understand it and are supportive of a wide range of United Nations instruments, be they declarations or covenants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is clear with respect to this matter that there is a broad misunderstanding in the community. That misunderstanding will not go away simply because the government decides to proceed despite that misunderstanding. A program should have been undertaken, probably long ago, to educate the people of Australia about the United Nations, its role in Australia and the impact of its instruments on Australian law. After all, if the government wants to legislate, it should do so in a way that takes the community with it, rather than imposing something on the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clear community concern about the declaration. The concern may be limited to a particular pocket, but that pocket feels very strong concern. There is no reason why that pocket should be deprived of that education prior to proceeding. There is no gain to those who are not confused by proceeding now. In fact, there is a loss to them. They would be better served if that education had been undertaken and the community as a whole could move forward in this respect. The government also, quite separately, should seek to educate Australians about the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. There seems to be some misunderstanding in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government itself, through failing to keep the people of Australia informed about these matters, is responsible for causing widespread concern in the community about this United Nations declaration and the effect of the ministerial declaration made under the HREOC act. This motion recognises that, while seeking to ensure religious freedom is in general terms a commendable pursuit, it is nonetheless an area which requires the most careful and detailed consideration. The length of time this declaration has taken to get through the United Nations is testament to that. The indisputable fact is that the government has not given the matter careful or detailed consideration and, as a consequence, I urge all honourable senators to agree to the motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration is a modern and more detailed expansion of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1981 and supported at that time by the Fraser government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration is designed to allow the human rights commission to do four things: firstly, it will allow the human rights commission to promote the understanding, acceptance and public discussion of the rights prescribed in the UN declaration; secondly, it will allow it to inquire into acts or practices of the Commonwealth which are inconsistent with the rights contained in the UN declaration; thirdly, it will examine Commonwealth legislation to determine whether it is consistent with the UN declaration; and, fourthly, it will report to the Commonwealth Attorney-General on action that it thinks should be taken by the Commonwealth on matters relating to human rights. That is all the declaration does and some of the concerns which have been raised are totally without foundation. This declaration is very important. It will strengthen the role of the human rights commission in pursuing the goal of religious tolerance within our society. </PARA>

But I will take honourable senators to the conclusion, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The state has a responsibility to ensure that its own practices do not conflict with or restrict basic human rights. In referring the Religion Declaration to the HREOC, the Government is opening its institutions to scrutiny in regard to religious discrimination.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that. The Liberal Party, in seeking to have this declaration disallowed, does not have the support of mainstream churches in Australia. It has not been able to produce one piece of evidence supporting its proposition. Despite that, it is interesting to see that the Liberal Party is pushing on with this matter. Despite not being able to gain any mainstream support for its views on this issue, it has continued to take the matter up in the House of Representatives and again today in the Senate. That needs some explanation. I hope Senator Kemp will make a contribution to the debate other than interjecting. I look forward to his contribution. I think some of his philosophy lies at the cornerstone of why the Liberal Party has adopted this approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to try to understand the Liberal Party's position, I began by looking at the debate on this matter in the House of Representatives. The shadow Attorney-General, Daryl Williams QC, gave a very competent and thorough speech. It looked very much like Senator Vanstone's contribution today. But it appeared that his heart was just not in it; he just did not seem to display much conviction. He started off by describing the objectives of the legislation as `laudable'. He thought the fears expressed by some constituents about restriction of the religious freedom of individuals were `difficult to sustain'. He then tried valiantly to raise concerns about the declaration. He talked about its ambiguity and contradictory provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, they were the same sorts of pseudo-legalistic concerns raised by Senator Vanstone. But they never went to the core of the issue; they never went to the heart of the declaration. Like Senator Vanstone, Mr Williams urges care and further detailed consideration. He talks about the lack of public understanding. But he never actually gets to the point as to why we should be opposing the declaration. I could not understand that. But there was a bit of a hint in that after covering the issues, he distanced himself quite clearly from those making arguments in this debate which he said were based on fear&mdash;those who sought to argue not on rational grounds but to beat up fear about what it would mean for the practice of religion in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not quite sure what he was referring to until I saw the contribution of his fellow member of the conservative forces, the honourable member for Gippsland, Mr McGauran. I could then understand what he was talking about when he referred to the politics of fear that have been engendered in this debate. In that contribution, Mr McGauran reflected two things: firstly, xenophobia; and, secondly, an opposition to international political institutions, because he sees them as a threat to Australia's political sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McGauran spoke of his fears and suspicions. He saw that this declaration would take us further than the legislation actually stated. The whole thing for him was tinged with a conspiracy theory, one reminiscent of the Labor Party activists of the 1960s. It just struck me that it was an interesting phenomena. In terms of his xenophobia, he used words such as `foreign instrument, Geneva based committees, extraterritorial laws, anonymous UN bureaucrats'&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure what he was on, but clearly he holds very strong views on the subject. Interestingly, towards the end of his contribution, he summarised his view, which was, `This is nothing more than an attack on the nation's sovereignty'. It is interesting that neither Senator Vanstone nor Daryl Williams QC could bring themselves to that point. But, clearly, they are captives of that dominant view within their party room because that is the basis for this position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am supported in that view by a very interesting article by Senator Kemp in a recent journal of the Institute of Public Affairs. I thought Senator Kemp gave a very strong, intellectual argument for the propositions put a little more bluntly by his friend, Mr McGauran. But that article reflected the same xenophobia and the same misplaced concern about the sovereignty of Australia. Really, it was reminiscent of the League of Rights sort of approach to these matters and an attack on the role of international institutions and international political law. It seems that this is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the churches are not concerned, what is it that is driving them? It seems that it can only be some sort of dogma, some sort of ideological position that has taken hold of the Liberal Party&mdash;the same Liberal Party which acquiesced quite happily when the declaration was endorsed in 1981. It now seems that maybe some people whom we generally associated with the lunatic fringe of the Right in Australian politics have an influence within the Liberal Party on these issues. That is obviously worrying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that old-fashioned Liberals such as Daryl Williams QC&mdash;and, I am sure, Senator Vanstone&mdash;seem to be isolated on this issue. Mr Williams was obviously isolated on the Mabo decision when his compatriots in the Western Australian Liberal Party even went as far as attacking Australia's national legal institutions, such as the High Court. It is a shame that the Liberal Party has moved so far to the right on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be interesting in response to quote what Justice Brennan had to say in the Mabo v. the State of Queensland [No.2] decision about the role of international law. I think it is important to put on the record a contrary view to those being espoused by the Liberals in this debate. In that judgment he said that international law is `a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law, especially when international law declares the existence of universal human rights'. He said that `this does not contradict the recognised principle of international law that international instruments, whatever their character, be they convention, declaration or protocol, do not have a force as of right in domestic or municipal law'. As I say, this debate is really driven by some sort of ideological commitment; it is not driven by a concern by the churches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have quoted the views of the churches of Western Australia. I have quoted the conclusion of the Catholic Bishops's discussion paper on the issue. This proposition is purely ideological. Those people in the Liberal Party who are unable to bring themselves to espouse the sorts of views that Mr McGauran and, undoubtedly, Senator Kemp will put, have tried to deal with issues of ambiguity. They talk about minor technical hitches, contradictions and so on. But they have not come to the heart of the issue, because their hearts are not in this debate. I urge all honourable senators to reject the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating Senator Vanstone's disallowance motion relating to the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations. On this issue it is important to make an assessment on what the law is, not on what one fears the law might be or might become in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to literally hundreds of letters from people which testify to the level of misunderstanding of this issue that is prevalent in the community, I have made quite extensive attempts to research, to consult, and to seek advice on this issue. I have reached the conclusion that it would be wrong to support this disallowance motion. I find it a little difficult to understand&mdash;in fact, almost irresponsible&mdash;why this issue has been brought into the public arena by way of a disallowance motion. Clearly, this has unsettled literally hundreds, even thousands, of people who do not have access to the legal advice that all of us in this chamber have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate, therefore, that we do not take steps as individual members&mdash;and leave it to the government&mdash;to deal with the this issue. We all have a responsibility in this area to attempt to clear up some of the misunderstanding which is in the community, rather than foster it in this particular way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the substance of the issue. The former Attorney-General, Mr Duffy, signed the declaration under section 47 of the HREOC act on 8 February 1993, the day on which parliament was dissolved. As a result, this declaration has become part of the definition of `human rights' for the purposes of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. In signing the declaration on that day, the former Attorney-General has ensured that, technically at least, his action did not fall within the previous government's caretaker period. However, I consider the timing was unfortunate in that it has prevented detailed parliamentary examination before today of this move and has given rise to concerns such as those I have adverted to before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following points need to be made: the declaration is not legislation in itself but rather a more detailed definition of the matters already covered by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. That definition already includes the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&mdash;as has been stated before&mdash;which gives the commission responsibilities through articles 2, 18, 26 and 27 of that convention to protect the freedom of religion. Article 18 includes the freedom `to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention recognises also that parents have the right to have their children taught within the framework of their religion and to organise the lives of their families accordingly. This is strongly supported by the Australian Democrats, subject only to any laws which are necessary to protect public safety, order, health, morals or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others. That answers the point that Senator Vanstone made when she warned that the religious practices of some religions in Australia would not accord with community standards or would even be contrary to our laws. Quite clearly, such practices would fall foul of our legal system and, I think, would be condemned by all members of the community. However, I repeat that the Australian Democrats believe strongly that parents have the right to have their children taught within the framework of their religion and to organise the lives of their families accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were not able to reach the conclusion that the declaration signed by the former Attorney-General did not support this or in any way damaged it or endangered it, we would today vote for the disallowance of this declaration. However, as I have said, we have reached the conclusion quite strongly that it does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration applies to the existing powers of the commission in relation to the acts, practices and legislation of the Commonwealth. As well, the commission is already empowered to inquire into `any act or practice that may be inconsistent with or contrary to any human right' and either to settle it by conciliation or `to report to the minister in relation to the inquiry'. That right already exists. It is not brought into existence by this declaration. It is noteworthy that the commission may not intervene in any other way, except to inquire and to report. In addition, the commission is to `promote an understanding and acceptance and the public discussion of human rights in Australia' and `to undertake relevant research and educational programs'. This is the addition, and the only addition, to the law as it stands by the incorporation of this declaration. This is an objective that hardly anybody could object to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration does not confer any new powers on the commission but will make it possible for the commission to address freedom of religion in all its aspects and implications under its existing powers as set out in the declaration. It should perhaps also be noted that the declaration arose from the suggestion in 1991 by Sir Ronald Wilson, President of the Human Rights Commission, that the government should reassure Australians who profess the Islamic faith that harassment will not be tolerated. The action taken in no way limits similar protection afforded to people who practice the Christian or any other religion. This again is one of the fears in the community that has been fomented by this&mdash;I say advisedly&mdash;irresponsible action by the Liberal Party. In particular, it needs to be confirmed that Australia's international obligations cannot be used to limit the right of religious or charitable institutions to employ staff, including teachers, of their faith and to reject applicants who are not of their faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has adopted the view that the enjoyment of rights and freedoms on an equal footing does not necessarily mean identical treatment. This was confirmed in the case of Broeks v. Netherlands which established that differentiation based on reasonable and objective criteria will not amount to prohibited discrimination where the purpose is legitimate under the convention. Clearly, freedom of religion is one of the purposes which is legitimate under the convention. The declaration itself states in article 6 that the `freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief includes the freedom to teach a religion or belief in places suitable for these purposes and to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it should be noted that complaints under the general human rights provisions of division 3, part II are limited to Commonwealth employment acts and practices and do not apply to those of religious organisations. Where employment acts and practices are not so limited&mdash;and I refer to the equal opportunity and employment provisions of division 4, part II&mdash;the definition of discrimination specifically excludes cases where `a distinction, exclusion or preference is made in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or that creed'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position could not be clearer. I really wonder at the motives of people who have access to this law, who have access to this advice and who have access to these provisions but who choose to ignore them and, for their own political purpose, unsettle people in the community and engender fear and misunderstanding. It is a reprehensible misuse of the political system. It need hardly be said that, on the basis of what I have said, the Australian Democrats cannot possibly support the motion for disallowance of the declaration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Vanstone's motion to disallow the incorporation of the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief into the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act by the Attorney-General. My colleague Senator Vanstone has made it clear that the coalition thoroughly endorses the principle that everyone should have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Our fear is that the declaration which the Attorney-General seeks to incorporate in the HREOC act may well serve to restrict, not enhance, freedoms that we now enjoy and may even lead to new forms of discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the comments made by Senator Spindler and, I think, Senator Chris Evans, the point has to be made that the incorporation of the declaration in the HREOC act makes this legislation. I have actually sought advice on this, in view of Senator Spindler's comment. It is part of the legislative framework which guides the work of the Human Rights Commission. Why would Senator Spindler stand up in this parliament and say something which he was poorly advised on? This will now become part of the legislation which governs the activity of the Human Rights Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Chris Evans said, to a certain extent it will expand the powers of that commission. Why should we get bogged down with pretending, as Senator Evans did, that it was practically of no consequence whatsoever so why would one bother to oppose it, and with Senator Spindler pretending that this did not have any legislative effect at all? It is legislation that expands the power of the Human Rights Commission and allows people who have complaints based on the various articles of the declaration to bring actions against the Commonwealth or its agencies. To that extent, it is a significant act and an important one. In debating this issue, we should not stand up and try to demean it in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his remarks, Senator Chris Evans referred to some earlier material that I have put out on the whole issue of international law. I know that Senator Chris Evans probably did not mean this, but to the extent that he tried to associate any views I have with support for the League of Rights, I find that absolutely appalling. I have nothing but contempt for the work of the League of Rights and I hope that Senator Evans was not attempting to slur my own character and my views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Senator Chris Evans raised an interesting issue about the whole nature of international law and the role that various UN conventions play in that area. It is true that over a very long period the Labor government has shown great enthusiasm for, and attraction to, ratifying and effectively incorporating in Australian law a whole range of UN conventions. We only have to look at the law relating to the environment, industrial relations and human rights to see that this has been a deliberate intention by the Labor government. I do not think Senator Chris Evans would deny that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own party has been cautious when we have moved in this direction, wanting to make sure that before we ratified particular acts, conventions or declarations we had the support of the whole Australian community, particularly as expressed by state governments. Further, we have made it very clear that in the use of UN conventions we would not be prepared to use the external affairs power to upset the balance of the constitution. That is a very real issue which we should not skate over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a degree of irony here. Senator Chris Evans lauded the importance of international law and, of course, it does have importance, but in relation to Australian domestic activities, he highlighted one of the real dilemmas that the Labor approach has headed Australia towards. We are being told that the republican push is important because we need to assert our sovereignty and independence. Senator Evans is smiling at that because he understands the dilemma of the argument that I will be making to him. The problem with what the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, has described in his penultimate book on foreign policy in Australia as the `new internationalist agenda' is that it seeks to involve Australian law in the whole web of international UN agreements. Senator Gareth Evans is quite explicit on that and he does not resile from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs made a very dramatic statement, and the Labor government did when, in 1991, it ratified the optional protocol and allowed Australian disputes to be taken offshore to be appealed to the UN human rights committee after they have satisfied all forms of appeal in Australia. Senator Chris Evans would know that this is a very important step by his government. It means that for the first time since the Australia Act 1986, Australian disputes can go offshore. I do not wish to explore this at any great length today but I point out to Senator Chris Evans that the nationalism with which he tries to promote the republican debate rings somewhat hollow when at the same time his own government is pursuing with great vigour and belief the need to involve international human rights committees, quasi courts and judges in Australian domestic affairs, which was quite contrary to the view that his party asserted as recently as 1986 in the Australia Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans has to recognise the contradiction with which his leaders are taking his own party. That is why I say to Senator Evans that when he extends the arguments that he is running for the republican debate to the new internationalist agenda, as defined by him in his book, there is a major contradiction. </PARA>

There is a fundamental difference. Senator Chris Evans would do well to read more of my articles on this particular issue so that he does not fall into such obvious traps.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were going along what I would describe as a more preferable route, as an Australian nationalist and someone who is proud of my country and my parliament, when we wish to change the law of this country it is far preferable that we change it through the traditional democratic ways through the parliamentary processes. As I said to Senator Spindler and Senator Chris Evans&mdash;Senator Evans will respond, as we are debating this act in the parliament, but I put it to him&mdash;had this been drafted as separate legislation, no minister would have been prepared to put his name to it and no parliamentary draftsman would have been prepared to serve up a draft which has so many problems. Senator Vanstone referred to that in her speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me illustrate some of those problems. Senator Bolkus will stand up and tell us how important this particular item is and how it should be incorporated in the HREOC act. Can Senator Bolkus tell us what the act means by the two fundamental words `religion' and `belief'? I do not think Senator Bolkus can, because the guiding statement in the declaration does not define what these two significant words in its title actually mean. I think that underlines the continuing weakness in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans tended to sneer at mention of ambiguities in the act but they are very real and very important. Senator Vanstone provided us with an example of the problems with this act and the rights of the child. As Senator Vanstone indicated, this provision gives parents the right to bring up their children according to their own beliefs, and I strongly support that view. But nowhere does the act mention the right of the child to his or her own beliefs. In other words, what is the critical age?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Chris Evans wishes to read more on these dilemmas, I draw his attention to an article written by Donna Sullivan and published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">American Journal of International Law</EMPHASIS>. Over many pages she outlines that the declaration is vague and that it is unclear what particular articles may mean. When we are making law in this country, when that law has to be interpreted and when people want to make appeals in relation to that law, they are entitled to know what those laws mean. Senator Chris Evans should not dismiss that sort of criticism as trivial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the article also outlines the conflicts that the declaration which we are debating in this parliament today has with other UN conventions. I am mindful of the fact that yesterday Senator Reid launched a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trust the Women</EMPHASIS>. It was interesting to read in Donna Sullivan's article that the declaration to end discrimination against women does conflict in some areas with the declaration that the government is asking us to incorporate into law today. That is why I say that, if this provision was independently drafted and brought to this chamber by Senator Bolkus, there would have been a very real attempt to sort out these very serious dilemmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration is ambiguous in many areas; it is vague in many areas; and it conflicts in a number of areas with other UN conventions which this government and other governments have ratified. When that occurs, it may take decades for this to start to wash through the system. But we are incorporating into the law of the land legislation which I believe we do not fully know the meaning of. If Senator Chris Evans had read this article, he would have understood that the case law, particularly in relation to a number of these UN conventions, is very new. The various UN human rights committees are now starting to build up case law as to what clauses mean and how they will be interpreted. Because of the vagueness of quite a number of these articles, we will not see for quite a long period how the international community interprets the meaning of these clauses. </PARA>

I suspect that Senator Chris Evans, as a nationalist, would be very cautious about putting the interpretation of law&mdash;law that will purely affect domestic disputes in this country&mdash;into the hands of UN committees, of which at best we may appoint one member. In relation to the UN human rights committee, we happened to appoint one out of the 18. Such UN committees will be interpreting UN conventions and human rights laws which will ultimately have an impact on our own society. I would have thought that Senator Chris Evans, as a strong republican, would object to that as I, as a strong constitutional monarchist, would equally object to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note Senator Vanstone's comments. She felt that a lot of the letters that she received were misconceived in some of the fears that they raised. For my own part I received a lot of very thoughtful and intelligent letters. They were not just random letters of which people send out bulk copies; they were not the sorts of letters that are signed by various electors and posted back to parliamentarians. Indeed, I was quite impressed by the number of individual and thoughtful letters I received on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there this wide concern? There is a growing nervousness in the community about the impact of UN conventions on the Australian community. Many people in the Labor Party have strongly supported such conventions but no-one would deny that they are having an important impact. I know from my own studies that no other comparative country has the same huge enthusiasm for UN conventions and instruments as the Australian Labor government. Other governments have special procedures in place&mdash;for example, Canada, whose approach to UN conventions is probably the closest to Australia's. Canada has a number of procedures in place which ensure that the various provinces have a say and a real impact when the central government decides to sign a UN treaty. West Germany in relation to the Lander, its own states, has similar processes. In the United States the Senate requires a two-thirds majority to ratify a treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Labor government&mdash;and this is a reflection of the whole approach of the Labor Party&mdash;has shown huge enthusiasm for the various conventions and declarations that the UN has adopted, and many would have no great objection to them as generalised aims. But when we see them being incorporated into a country's domestic law, where precision is required, and when they are used as a battering ram through the external affairs power to overturn key elements of the constitution, I believe this is the reason that we are seeing emerging in this country quite a degree of nervousness with respect to the UN conventions and the whole internationalist approach of Senator Gareth Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I referred to earlier, Senator Gareth Evans and colleagues stood up in this parliament in support of the Australia Act and said that Australian law must be self-contained: it is our law; it is our country; and our courts must be the highest courts to which Australians can appeal. That was the whole philosophy underlying the Australia Act. Senator Chris Evans's colleagues&mdash;Senator Chris Evans was not in this parliament; therefore, there is no reason for him to shoulder the blame&mdash;have completely reversed that philosophy. That is precisely what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Chris Evans, Senator Spindler, the Australian Democrats and the Greens that certainly many of the intentions underlying the declaration which has come before the parliament today are worthy and ones which we would support. But as elements of Australian legislation, of legislation under which particular actions will be taken by individuals, the declaration is unsatisfactory for the reasons that my colleague Senator Vanstone has outlined: the contradictions, vagueness, conflict with other UN conventions&mdash;which the Labor Party has endorsed&mdash;and ambiguities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we should always enhance religious tolerance in this country. I think Australia has generally&mdash;I do not say there are not the occasional problems&mdash;created a very tolerant, peaceful and fair society. But if one wishes to buttress that and enhance those very desirable values, in my view, one should not go down this route. The government should bring before the parliament proper legislation which reflects the values of the Australian community and any special problems in it. It can then put its name to it and, if it is good enough, we will also put our name to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is doing here what it has done so often&mdash;pulling a Labor Party stunt. Just before the election a whole rash of these international conventions were signed. This is only one of them. Three or four major ones were signed in relation to the ILO to buttress the position of the government's union mates. It is international law. If the government is going to fight political battles, it should fight them here in Australia, not in Geneva. That is the point I put to honourable senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also signed a number of other optional protocols and procedures which opened up Australian appeals to other UN committees&mdash;against the advice of some of the states.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Kemp's contribution encapsulated the fears of most people about this United Nations convention. People, particularly rural people, are concerned that we are handing over our laws to 18 members of the UN body. What they are saying when they approach us, the members of parliament and senators, is, `We elect you to govern in Australia. We are happy with the Westminster system. We believe in the Liberals'&mdash;or the Nationals, the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats&mdash;`this is our parliament and we are proud of this system. We want you to enact the laws and be responsible to us, the people who elect you'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, all these United Nations conventions that we are signing are taking away the power of their vote when they elect members of parliament. If they are not happy with us, they can dismiss us. But these conventions are taking that right away from them. That is why I believe there is so much concern about these UN conventions. Therefore, I support the motion of disallowance that Senator Vanstone has so ably moved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration was put forward by the former Attorney-General under subsection 47(1) of the act and was first introduced on 24 February this year by means of an insert into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS>. It was tabled in both houses of parliament on 4 May. There was no ministerial explanation at the time of why the declaration was needed. In the House of Representatives, the debate was truncated as normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the president of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, the objective of the declaration is to strengthen the resolve of the nation states in promoting religious freedom. I have been in this place 11 years. Many of my colleagues on this side of parliament have been here as long. In my 11 years experience I cannot recall one occasion when I have received a deputation, phone call or letter from a constituent who has complained that his or her religious freedom is not total. I have never seen any indication in the press that religious freedom is being usurped in Australia. Australia truly must be the most tolerant country in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this assurance has done little to allay the fears of many Australians, who are extremely concerned about what they see as the state further legislating on their religious practices. We have heard that the mainstream churches were not involved by Senator Gareth Evans. I have a list of some people who I believe represent the mainstream churches. The Charismatic Church has a membership well in excess of 150,000 people in Australia. It would have to be considered one of the mainstream churches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others include the Assemblies of God in Australia; the Presbyterian Church, which is a traditional church; the Christian City Church in New South Wales; the Presbyterian Church of Queensland General Assembly; the Baptist Women's Union of the South-West Pacific; the Baptist Church of Western Australia; the Free Reformed Church of Armidale; the Bedford Gospel Chapel; the Anglican Men's Society; and the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, Sir Frank Little. They all oppose the declaration. Others include the Seventh Day Adventists; Full Gospel Churches of Australia; and the Christian Women's Communicating International. They are mainstream churches. They cannot be pushed aside as some collection of offbeat people. They represent probably 60 or 70 per cent of the churchgoing community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been widespread confusion and anxiety in the community as people struggle to grasp the intention of the declaration and the likely effects of its incorporation into law. The level of community concern has been strong. I do not have to remind people here of that. I have received more letters over this than any other piece of legislation or United Nations declaration that has been dealt with. Some of those letters are form letters, but some are well constructed and well argued letters. I will quote some of them later in my contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one rang me or asked me to allow this declaration to go through. All my colleagues on all sides of the chamber, including the Democrats, were deluged by a string of letters and phone calls from people proposing the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has received hundreds of letters on the issue. The declaration on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief has a long, convoluted history. It started out as a resolution of the General Assembly of the United Nations when it was first put forward in 1962. It was finally adopted by the United Nations on 25 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took more than 19 years of discussion, negotiation and compromise for this resolution to be passed by the United Nations. Yet we and the Australian people are supposed to accept it into Australian law after only about six months, six short months in which no explanation has been advanced by the government to demonstrate why we need this United Nations's declaration to become law. There has been absolutely no attempt by the government to allay the genuine fears of many people in the community about the very real prospect of the greater intrusion by the state into their religious lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am opposed to this declaration for several reasons. I do not believe that we, as legislators who are elected by vote, should pass our responsibilities away to an unelected group of people that have their head office in Geneva. I do not know who are the 18 people on the United Nations court. I do not know what countries they come from. But one thing I am sure of is that any of those countries that those people represent around the world would not have the traditional freedoms that we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the Australian people want or need this United Nations declaration foisted upon them as law. Our religious freedoms are already guaranteed through section 116 of the constitution, as well as through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act which gives force to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As a party to this international instrument, Australia must comply with its provision to safeguard the fundamental human rights and freedoms of thought, conscience and religion. We do all that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With these religious freedoms guaranteed by the act, and upheld by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission&mdash;and there is section 116 of the constitution&mdash;why then do we need a declaration citing religious freedoms that we already possess? The last thing Australia needs is more law, particularly so when it is unnecessary, poorly drafted and unclear in meaning in several critical sections. The declaration is a weakly constructed document and open to interpretation and conjecture in several parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who interprets that? Is it the 18 unelected people in Geneva in the United Nations court or is it the High Court of Australia? Why do we need it? I am uneasy with the imprecise wording and ambiguous meaning found in several articles in the declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main principles of the declaration is contained in eight articles. For purposes of shortness, I will address only those which have caused me the most concern. The most ambiguous section of the declaration is that which is related to religious discrimination. Article 2 prohibits discrimination by any state, institution, group or person on the grounds of religion or other belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the definition given for the term intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief in the second paragraph of article 2 where the concern lies. The declaration defines intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief to mean any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on religion or belief. Concern has been raised over the use of the word `preference' in this concept. Fears have grown that this could be taken to mean that independent church schools would not be permitted to specify the religious orientation of their staffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for Senator Spindler to get up and give us an assurance that this will not happen, but it will not be this parliament that will be interpreting whether there is a breach. It will not be this legislature that will make a decision. It will be the members of the High Court who are unelected, or it will be the other court where, at the moment, we are represented by one member out of 18. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fundamental right that parents should be free to choose how their children are educated, and the sort of people who are entrusted with the education, guidance and pastoral care of their children. Discrimination in employment on the basis of religion would therefore seem to breach this section of the declaration. While there is an exception provided in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act for discrimination on the basis of religion, by religious education institutions, in order to uphold the religious teachings of the institutions, the government has done nothing to allay community anxiety that the autonomy of independent church schools may be under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other questions in relation to this section have been raised; such as, would fundamentalist Muslim employers be compelled to employ non-Muslim female workers who might dress in a manner, through display of bare arms or legs, that they would find offensive? Or would an orthodox Jewish restaurateur be forced to hire someone who would not be prepared to observe the kosher rituals in the kitchen? Or would Christian bookshops be required to employ homosexuals who flaunt their lifestyle choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see that Senator Bolkus has a smile on his face. He may well smile but these are genuine concerns that have been raised by people who have studied this act. Senator Bolkus may not agree with their observations, but I am sure he would agree that they have the right to raise these issues with their federal representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are valid concerns arising from the inherent vagueness in the wording of the document which certainly leaves itself open to all sorts of interpretations. Article 5 of the declaration deals with the rights of both parents and children. This has also raised considerable confusion and uncertainty in the community. In this section, parents, as the legal guardians of their children, are given the right to organise their family life in accordance with their religious beliefs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 5 of article 5 is of particular concern. It states that practice of a religion or belief in which a child is brought up must not be injurious to his physical or mental health or to his full development. Does this mean that religious instruction could be curtailed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many pieces of legislation that go through this place&mdash;I have seen it myself&mdash;that end up with unintended consequences. In fact, the unintended consequence clause has now become part of the Australian vernacular. We set out with the best intentions in the world to do what is right by the people and find that the legislation that we pass is interpreted in totally the wrong way and we end up doing more harm than good. I think this could be a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we really want the Human Rights Commission to be given even more power in the area of overseeing religious freedom than what is already included in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, under sections 11 and 31 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act? Already the Human Rights Commission is empowered to intervene in legal proceedings involving human rights, and to require individuals to give evidence and furnish information and documents at these human rights inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gradually our freedoms are being restricted. We start off with equal opportunities and we find that other people are being discriminated against. It is not intended, but it is a result. We can all quote cases of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we want the authority of the Human Rights Commission extended further, for the commissioner to become the arbitrator and put his interpretation on our value judgments? At what point do teachings become injurious to a child's physical or mental health or to its full development? If there are occasions that that does happen, and I would conceive that there are, then there are state laws that can be invoked that remove the child from the injurious situation. We have those laws now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would the teachings of fundamentalist Christianity be considered injurious, or Catholicism as viewed by Protestants, or Judaism by Muslims? The point is that this would call for an extremely subjective decision to be brought down. Do we want the Human Rights Commissioner further empowered to make such a decision? Members of the constituency which elects me clearly do not, and they give me this message continually through the branch meetings and the community groups that we represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that this unwanted United Nations declaration should be foisted upon the Australian people. Too many people are suffering grave fears that legislation may be placed on their religious practices. Senator Bolkus will probably tell me that their fears are unfounded, but why do we have to go down this path and frighten people? There is no need for it. Can the minister tell me that Australia does not have the best religious freedoms in the world?</PARA>

The members of the conference simply wanted the pros and cons. I made it crystal clear to them prior to the meeting, at the meeting and in subsequent conversations and correspondence, that I was in no way seeking to influence them one way or the other.

For Senator Chris Evans to come in here and start putting some other shadow over the meeting is absolutely and utterly absurd and it is rude to those people concerned.

If there is someone who did attend the meeting who had a contrary viewpoint, I would be more than happy to talk to that person about it because there is no way that the tone of my letter or the tone of that meeting was anything other than seeking their input, and doing something that the Labor Party had deliberately chosen not to do. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone and Senator Kemp both asked why the former Attorney-General was so keen to move in this way. There is plenty of evidence available to answer that question. The impetus to make the United Nations declaration part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act came from Sir Ronald Wilson. It was at a multi-faith seminar at Monash University in 1991 that he, as chairman of that group, was made aware of the problems of minority religions within Australia and of the prejudice that many of them faced. It was a conference convened by the World Conference on Religion and Peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that Sir Ronald Wilson is a former justice of the High Court and I would like to place on record his opinion about the effect of both the United Nations declaration and of attaching it to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note . . . that the Commonwealth's action does not have the effect of making any conduct unlawful and that the relevant powers conferred on HREOC are confined to community education and a monitoring of conduct by the Commonwealth itself.</PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adding the Declaration to the HREOC Act will not make any activity unlawful. The aim of the Declaration is to promote the right to freedom of religion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's responsibilities are to promote understanding and acceptance of the Declaration and to inquire into Commonwealth laws and practices to ensure they are consistent with the rights recognised in the Declaration.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to add some further information about Sir Ronald. Not only is he a former justice of the High Court and President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, but also he is a very active Christian. He was for three years President of the National Assembly of the Uniting Church in Australia and a person who has been active in human rights and social justice causes for many years. His letter to the Attorney-General in 1991 urging him to move in this way arose out of his concerns during the Gulf War in which Australian Muslims were subjected to incidents of racism which certainly impinged on their freedom of religion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received many objections to the action of the minister in the form of letters and it is interesting to note where some of them have come from.

I presume that he sent it simply as information and I certainly thank him for that, but if he endorsed the contents of it, then one would have to wonder about his knowledge and understanding of the Christian faith and certainly of church history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to give the Senate some information about this booklet and where it comes from. The sponsoring organisation of the booklet is the Foundation for the Advancement of Christian Studies. This organisation is a front for a United States based movement known as Christian reconstructionism. It is ultra-Calvinist and exclusive. It has a mission to rule the world by translating into modern law many old testament prohibitions, including capital punishment for offences which I believe we would find quite bizarre. One of the contributing authors is Dr Rushdoony, who is the intellectual guru of the reconstruction movement in the United States. The Foundation for the Advancement of Christian Studies is linked with the Logos Foundation, as is the Network for Christian Values&mdash;another source of many of the objections which I received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Objections were also received from mainstream Christians. I do not want to play numbers games with either Senator Knowles or Senator Boswell, but the Council of Churches of Western Australia represents many thousands of Christians. The Uniting Church of Australia, which apart from some individuals has been very supportive of this declaration, represents hundreds of thousands of Christians in Australia. It is important, however, to try to answer some of the objections, no matter what their source is. By not supporting the opposition's motion, the Australian Democrats guarantee the freedom of those with whom we disagree to have their views heard, and we would want to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to just a few of the specific objections which are recorded in this book.

For instance, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United Nations is the humanistic Mount Olympus and Tower of Babel, a dream of reason whereby man becomes his own god and totally governs the earth and his destiny.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way the authors of this book view the United Nations. It seems to me that, on any realistic evaluation of the United Nations, rather than seeing it as some kind of world government, people would admit that it is a very weak instrument indeed and that they would rather see it strengthened than weakened further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument in this book which supports an objection to the declaration is the constant affirmation that Australia is a Christian country. In terms of religion, Australia has a majority of Christians, but we need to understand the history of Christianity in Australia and to understand that Christianity in Australia is racked by division and sectarianism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 January 1788, Governor Arthur Phillip declared that Roman practices such as transubstantiation would not be allowed on Australian soil. For 40 years Roman Catholics in Australia were prevented from receiving the ministrations of their own priests. Through much of the history of Australia, Irish Catholics were oppressed in this country, to say nothing of the history and religion of the Chinese or the oppression and almost wiping out of Aboriginal religion and culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to claim that Australia is a Christian country, we must claim it warts and all. The history of the Christian church in Australia is plagued with division and sectarianism. In 1993 we should put that behind us and declare that this is a country in which there ought to exist not only many forms of the Christian religion, but also other religions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those who have objected to the declaration have said that we are protected by the Australian constitution. Again we need to understand the history of that particular clause in the constitution which prohibits the establishment of any religion. It was designed to overcome the sectarian debates of the 19th century in which the Church of England particularly tried to have itself established as the state church in Australia, as it had been in England. For that reason, the framers of the Australian constitution put into that clause the technical phrase that there should not be any religion established in Australia. For the same reason, the qualification of religion for any public office, as had plagued English history, was disallowed in our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have searched in this book for any theology or Christian values to justify the position which is taken. I find it to be almost totally lacking, apart from a few biblical references which are taken totally out of context. My experience as a university chaplain, dealing with students from overseas and those with religions other than my own, has served to underline the richness of the variety of the religions that we have in this country. But it also underlines the prejudice which exists between religious groups. I am sad to say that the most vehement religious prejudice is often on behalf of those whom Ron Boswell described as fundamentalist Christians. I regret that. I worked incredibly hard as a university chaplain to bring some of those groups together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Yugoslavia is a current example of political, cultural and religious prejudice that we would want to counteract by this declaration in this country. It is important to support the extension of the freedom of religion. It is under threat in Australia. That is why the Democrats will not support the opposition's motion for disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate is about freedom. It is about how freedom is established and how freedom is best protected. Those of us in the National and Liberal parties are here today because we seek the disallowance of this instrument. We do not believe that it is necessary to assist in the protection of religious freedom; nor do we believe that the underlying philosophy that the government relies on is satisfactory as a means of ensuring tolerance and good relations between different groups of our society. The whole issue is as simple as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is not about putting up straw men or finding a book and then deriding it and saying that that is the basis of the case. It is not about claiming that people have bullied religious groups. It is not even about counting religious groups. It is much more fundamental than that. It is about how we ensure freedom. Those on the other side of the chamber fall into what is called the positivist camp. They believe that it is possible in this world to create a set of rules and derive everything from those rules. It follows that they say that everything must be legislated for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us on this side of the chamber differ because we base our philosophy very much on natural law. The fundamental principle, which Senators Panizza, Ian Macdonald, Ferguson, Watson or myself would all agree with, is that everybody should be free, except when that freedom infringes somebody else's freedom. That is the way one has a harmonious society. In a family one does not have to write down all the rules and say, `So and so shall be allowed to do this and so and so shall not be allowed to do that'. One says, `You have as much freedom as you want, provided that you do not infringe other people's freedom'. That precept requires people in the course of their actions to think about how what they do might affect other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes the view that the government takes and says, `Everything must be legislated', what one is really saying is that an individual's only protection is a bit of paper which, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you well know, can be ripped up as I am ripping up this piece of paper now. So much for that protection. But when one builds a society that is based on mutual respect, the protections run much more deeply. It is totally ridiculous for anybody to say that we do not in our body of law in this country at this moment have protection for people's religious beliefs. Of course we do. It is well recognised. There have been many cases in many places many times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though the proposal that the government brings before the chamber is one that will add to the law. Is it that this proposal will make the legal system function more efficiently? That too is not the case because the body which will be charged with the oversight of these matters is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. This is not a judicial body; it does not follow the rules of court that one might find in the Federal Court or the Supreme Court of Queensland or in any of the equivalent courts in other states. It is a body that is not obliged to follow the usual rules of evidence. It is a statutory body, not a judicial body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me and those of us on this side of the chamber is that increasingly in this country we seem to be giving to statutory bodies and public office holders the right to hear matters which should be more appropriately heard in courts of law. It is strange that we have in this constitution of ours a prohibition on the establishment of religion. The government says, `We have a proposal that is going to enlarge religious freedom', but the interesting thing is that it gives the power to decide to Commonwealth officers. When one has government deciding on religion one really does have grounds for concern and fear. </PARA>

The question is: are minority religions better protected through the positivist viewpoint or are they better projected through natural law? My unswerving belief is that they are better protected through natural law because at the end of the day they are always dependent under the positivist viewpoint on government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I rise in support of the motion to disallow the declaration made by the former Attorney-General, the Hon. Mr Duffy, on 8 February this year, the day after the general election was called. This declaration was tabled in both Houses by the government on 4 May. On first reading the declaration appears laudable enough: it is to bring the rights and freedoms recognised by the United Nations declaration, with regard to the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief, within the definition of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not questioning the concept that everybody has the right to freedom of thought, conscience or religion or that anyone should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. But I am questioning, on behalf of the many concerned church groups and parents who have contacted me, whether or not this declaration could actually restrict the freedoms that we currently enjoy. We have freedoms bestowed through the constitution, our judicial system and the parliaments that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These institutions are not necessarily pre-eminent in many other countries of the world, so these sorts of declarations might be quite appropriate for many countries. But because of the vagueness of the terminology, I question the implications that this may have and the potential for conflict further down the track in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the groups and the constituents who have contacted me is the fear that agreeing to this declaration will destroy the freedoms that we have rather than enlarging the freedoms that are so necessary for all to live without fear of discrimination in the area of religion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration purports to extend human rights and religious freedom, but no justification has been given by the government for the need to extend the rights that we already have. What is feared most by those who have contacted me is that this declaration will override parental wishes in relation to the religious education of their children. This fear comes from the fact that the declaration is based on a UN declaration in which the clarity of meaning has been sacrificed for the sake of compromise. One of my colleagues in the House of Representatives aptly said that the UN declaration is `a series of vague, ambiguous and potential contradictory provisions'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to reiterate why the UN declaration is vague. My colleague Senator Vanstone and others who have spoken in this debate on our side have already explained the problems in these areas, but I would like to reiterate the problem provided by the provision within the UN declaration dealing with the religious education of children. I thank my colleague Mr Daryl Williams for his very lucid explanation of this in the other place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension for dinner, I was quoting my colleague in the House of Representatives Mr Daryl Williams QC who said that the UN declaration was a series of vague, ambiguous and potentially contradictory provisions. I now want to take this opportunity to explain why I agree with the assertions of Mr Williams.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights require that the state parties to the covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions. In a similar vein, article 5(1) of the UN declaration provides that parents and legal guardians of children have the right to organise the life within the family in accordance with their belief or religion and bearing in mind the moral education in which they believe the child should be raised. Meanwhile, article 5(3) of the UN declaration provides that the child shall be brought up in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship amongst peoples, peace and universal brotherhood, with respect for freedom of religion or belief of others, in full consciousness that his energy and talents should be devoted to the service of his fellow man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parent concerned to educate his or her child in accordance with the parent's religious commitments could well find that the tenets of his or her religion are not in conformity with these particular requirements. The apparently absolute rights given to parents to ensure the religious and moral education of their children may appear to be enshrined in this UN declaration. But the point I wish to make is that it is inconsistent with article 5(2) of the declaration. This article states that, while every child shall enjoy the right to have access to education in the matter of religion or belief in accordance with the wishes of his parents or legal guardians, he shall not be compelled to receive teaching in religion or belief against his wishes. `The best interests of the child' is the guiding principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this very phrase, `the best interests of the child', which I put to you, Mr Deputy President, opens the door for the overriding of parental wishes in relation to the religious education of their children. Many Christian groups, parents and churches are concerned that, as fewer and fewer families within society are embracing the once strong Western European Judaeo-Christian traditions within their families, these groups in the long term actually could become a minority. In the extreme case, members of our society could declare that the so-called Christian education and the transmitting of Christian ethics and values that occurs within these families could be regarded by others within society as not being in the best interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this is the extreme situation and that many would say that this would not occur in a country with freedoms such as we have in Australia&mdash;guaranteed by a judicial system, by the parliaments around the country, including this parliament, and the constitution&mdash;but would occur only in places with a regime such as that in, say, the former communist USSR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I am making is that the present HREOC act gives us freedom of religion. The vague definitions of what is religious freedom and what is in the best interests of the child really need very careful consideration. Therefore, I believe that any proposal for domestic legislation seeking to protect or promote religious freedom must be viewed with the greatest of care. The consequences of this declaration in practical terms have been aptly expressed by Bishop Daily, the Bishop of Sandhurst. In correspondence to my lower house colleagues he noted as one example:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non Catholic Students attend Catholic Schools, and under this article they could maintain that their Religious beliefs are not catered for, also they could maintain that they will not abide by that Schools regulations with regard to Christian principles, and could maintain they are being coerced.</PARA>
<PARA>Amongst his many other comments he finally states that, effectively, governments could make state and church education systems one, with no religion taught in schools. Possible reasons that could be given are: that no one religion covers all beliefs and that religions, therefore, have no place in school curriculums. This is a view that has been put in certain states of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fear held not only by Catholic parents&mdash;and I ask my good friend Senator Barney Cooney, a man of tremendous tolerance and religious conviction, to consider this aspect. In Tasmania I have been approached by members of many of the Protestant churches as well. This very week, in fact, I intend to present another petition from 150 signatories who are prominent church people within my own town of Launceston and who are concerned about this declaration. They believe it could restrict the parents' right to oversee the religious education of their children. In addition, I have a file several centimetres thick of letters on this issue which have steadily been delivered to my office over the past few months. Many of these letters have five to 10 signatures. So permeating right across society there is this fear or concern that this is probably not necessary in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I would say that several hundred constituents throughout Tasmania have contacted me with regard to this issue. These people are concerned. The possible loss of parents' right to educate their children in their religion is not regarded lightly by many constituents or, indeed, by me. I know that many will say that I am citing the extreme position. But the point to make is that, when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act is examined, it can be noted that it already incorporates significant statements on the issue of religious freedom. There is no need to extend that freedom, as far as we are concerned, in Australia. It may be necessary in other countries, but it is not necessary here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission already has ample power to promote the concept of religious freedom and to investigate infringement of that freedom by the Commonwealth or, indeed, by its agencies. Therefore, I contend that there is no need now to extend through this declaration the definition of human rights, particularly with regard to religious freedom; and that this chamber, therefore, should disallow this declaration. But I look forward to the informed comments of my colleague, the deeply religious senator across the way, the honourable Barney Cooney. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . declared under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 that the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on the 25 November 1981 (resolution 36/55) is an international instrument relating to human rights and freedoms for the purposes of that act;</PARA>
<PARA>The motion then points out the only objection to the declaration being allowed. It says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) noting that it is desirable that there be appropriate opportunities for public consideration and parliamentary debate of the declaration&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">disallows the declaration by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA>The contentions in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) would lead to the conclusion that the declaration should be allowed by this house&mdash;in other words, that the motion for disallowance should be defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the strategy that was used to have this declaration disallowed. The only basis for disallowance is the argument that there was no appropriate opportunity for public consideration. In other words, the motion itself does not contain any provision saying that there is anything wrong with the general thrust of what this declaration does. The declaration in itself is not attacked; the only thing attacked is the fact that there has not been an appropriate opportunity for public consideration. So debate in this house about other matters&mdash;that there is uncertainty and that the declaration may lead to all sorts of dire consequences&mdash;does not relate to the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, the honourable member for Tangney, Mr Williams, discussed these other issues. But these other issues are not raised in the motion. In his speech, Mr Williams said: <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition accepts that the ministerial declaration does not of itself make the UN declaration part of Australia's domestic law.</PARA>
<PARA>He accepts that proposition. In other words, the declaration does not in any way introduce into the domestic law the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion and Belief. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of the Human Rights Commissioner contained in the HREOC Act in relation to investigating conduct that constitutes a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>So all the declaration does is put forward propositions with which, I hope, everybody in this chamber would agree. The only practical effect it has in relation to anything being able to be enforced is in terms of the Commonwealth and its agencies. So it does not go, for example, to issues of relationships between members of a family. Mr Williams went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, it is accepted that some of the more extreme fears that have been voiced, and in particular those which suggest that the UN declaration operates to curtail the religious freedom of individuals, are difficult to sustain. Nonetheless, there are compelling reasons why the former Attorney-General's declaration should be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>But the fact of the matter is that this motion attempts to disallow a declaration that does not have general application throughout the community, which does not in any way interfere with the way the domestic law operates, but which does contain great propositions that we would have hoped everybody would agree with. It is very difficult, given that situation, to see why this declaration should be disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Williams went on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is not bound at international law to comply with the terms of the UN declaration, nor is it bound to incorporate its provisions into Australian domestic law.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to quote the following paragraph in particular:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its adoption in 1981 means little more than that the principles sought to be stated in the declaration were accepted by Australia as a step in the process of endeavouring to reach a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Williams uses that as an argument against the declaration and in favour of the disallowance motion. I would have thought that statement is an argument very much in favour of allowing the declaration and for voting against the disallowance motion. What Mr Williams said is that Australia is joining with the rest of the world in an endeavour to reach a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we vote against the declaration, we will, according to the propositions put forward by the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, be voting against Australia helping to bring to fruition international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination. By voting against this, we will be, on the very argument put forward by the shadow Attorney-General, rejecting a proposition that could help spread religious tolerance and anti-discrimination amongst the world as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be in no doubt about what will be the effect of voting to disallow the declaration. On the analysis of the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, we would be voting down a step in the process of endeavouring to reach `a formal international consensus on the subject of religious intolerance and discrimination'. What he is really saying is that he does not want that to happen but that there is uncertainty in the way the declaration is framed. Anything is uncertain. For example, section 92 of the constitution, which states that interstate trade will be absolutely free, is uncertain. This has been shown to be the case by the High Court, even though the meaning seems to be apparent at first glance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be argued that laws out of which uncertainty can be teased should be rejected. But on that basis, most legislation that comes before any parliament could be rejected. Mr Williams asked, for example, what is meant by `appropriate charitable institutions'&mdash;an expression used in part of the declaration. What does that mean? I would have thought that meant charitable institutions of a good quality; that one cannot get out of ones obligations under the declaration by setting up an institution which is inferior and really cannot be used for the purpose for which it is intended. In my view, that is quite clear. In any event, a court would have no more trouble in interpreting that than it would have in interpreting most legislation that comes through this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this is the same sort of expression that people talk about in relation to, say, corporation laws. We are talking about laws being written so that they are not as precise as they might otherwise be; a fuzzy law setting out principles and the courts being left to decide things in particular circumstances. If fuzzy law is all right to guide corporations in this country, why is it not all right to guide the sort of conduct that we all instinctively know is right&mdash;that is, that there ought to be religious freedom and that people should not be persecuted for their beliefs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Williams went on to tease out of the HREOC legislation and the declaration an apparent conflict. With respect to Mr Williams&mdash;a great lawyer&mdash;that is again taking a very technical approach. The courts and people in society generally know instinctively how balances are to be struck in legislation that is apparently contradictory. It is only contradictory when it is read in a very black letter way. Mr Williams says that the declaration might allow religious bodies to promote unacceptable practices involving mutilation of the body. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In societies observing other religions, females are accorded inferior status and rights. Indeed, religious beliefs and practices which effectively make women and children second-class citizens almost certainly conflict with existing equal opportunity and sex discrimination legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is probably right. Any sensible person would say that if there is freedom of religion, it is not a freedom to mutilate women; it is not a freedom to treat certain sections of society as second-class citizens. It means that we all should be entitled to the deeply held beliefs we have. Towards the end of his speech, Mr Williams says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government should amend the HREOC Act to allow for examination of international instruments prior to their being declared in relation to other functions of the commission. The government should also undertake to educate the people of Australia about the United Nations, its role in Australia and the impact of its instruments on Australian law. The government should also seek to educate Australians about the functions of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The government, through failing to keep the people of Australia informed about these matters, is responsible for causing widespread concern in the community about this United Nations declaration and the effect of the ministerial declaration under the HREOC Act.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand the shadow Attorney-General to be saying, `There is really nothing wrong with this declaration', in spite of what has been said by his colleagues on the other side. He is saying that there is nothing wrong with this declaration, but that it has not been properly explained. That is consistent with the way in which the motion before us tonight is put forward; the only objection is that there has not been opportunity for public consideration of the declaration. The two things that come out of what Mr Williams says are: firstly, that there has been a lack of consultation; and secondly, that there should be more education of the people of Australia about how the United Nations works, how these declarations work and how the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission works. Those are all procedural matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The content of this declaration is not taken to task. The issue of whether or not it is properly framed is not really a matter going to its substance; it is a matter that goes to the way it is expressed. That seems a most slender basis for rejecting this declaration. It seems to be agreed by the shadow attorney-general that the sentiments in the declaration are magnificent. Nobody could argue with that. It allows for freedom of religion, freedom of thought and freedom of conscience, and we are going to disallow the declaration on the most slender of grounds. We are going to cast aside a declaration which was adopted in 1981 by the Fraser government&mdash;a government of the coalition. Mr Williams says the declaration took 19 years in the drafting. It has been around since 1981. People understand this; they have surely discussed it. It has raised great issues. Yet tonight it will be rejected and, no doubt, that will be the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The occasion of this declaration was at the request, as I understand it, of Sir Ronald Wilson. This has been spoken about again and again. He was President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, a deeply religious man who had a distinguished career as a justice of the High Court. It was his suggestion that this declaration be brought in in the context of the Gulf War. His concern was that the issues surrounding the Gulf War may have an impact on how people of the Muslim faith were treated in this community. It would seem to me that we ought to pay great respect and great attention to what he said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has been criticised in recent times but it has made decisions which establish the principles upon which we live in this society: freedom of expression in the political ads case; people accused of crimes should be entitled to legal representation; the right of people accused of criminal charges to a jury; and that ministerial decisions should be made correctly and fairly, applying the principles of natural justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court, that third arm of government, is conscious of the needs to preserve rights in the community. It is about time this chamber and the parliament generally had discussions about issues of human rights and human principles. There might be less need for the High Court to protect our civil rights were we in parliament to put forward and at least give legislative form to some of these rights. If we were to do that, we would vote against this disallowance motion. That would at least be a declaration&mdash;that is all it would be&mdash;about the principles inherent in the declaration before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the declaration is voted down, it will be another example of the interests in this parliament simply centring on economic matters. Many of those economic matters are based on economic rationalism. An eminent judge in Victoria, Mr Justice Vincent, who today addressed the law conference in Hobart said, `There is not only economic rationalism, there is social rationalism' which means that those great aspirations that we should have as members of society are put aside in the interests of efficiency, whatever that may mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A vote in favour of this disallowance motion would be another example of the social rationalism that is pervading society&mdash;and perhaps this chamber&mdash;at the moment. This is a chance to give expression to the great aspirations we feel without introducing them into domestic law and without in any way affecting the relationships between members of a family or between one member of society and another. It has only a practical effect on the Federal government and its agencies. On the other hand, its passage would allow a great educative impact to occur in society where religion is, in my view, still of great importance, still the basis of our society and something we should give attention to. In his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Civil Liberties in Australia</EMPHASIS> Geoffrey Flick says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common law, it would appear, does not regard discrimination on racial or religious grounds as contrary to public policy. Thus, by way of example, it has long been the practice of some testators to impose a condition in their wills stating that a beneficiary is to forfeit a benefit conferred if he should marry a person "not of the Jewish faith", or on ceasing "to profess the Roman Catholic religion". Such conditions may fail if no meaning can properly be ascribed to the terms employed by the testator or if no efficacy can be given to the application of the condition to the facts. But according to the House of Lords in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blathwayt v. Baron Cawley</EMPHASIS> a condition which is not so uncertain as to be unenforceable is not contrary to public policy.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a need for some education to take place within the community to remove that very significant element of racial and religious discrimination. Perhaps I ought to withdraw the word `racial' because that is not relevant to the present debate. There is a need to remove that too great an element of religious intolerance that still operates in the community and to introduce tolerance and respect for people in terms of their freedom of thought, conscience and religion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support the remarks that have been made by members on our side of the House today. I do so not because I am a person with the eminent legal qualifications of Senator Cooney, and not because I do not believe in the particular international instrument that was declared under subsection 47(1) of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 on 8 February this year, but because I fear that a lot of people in our community are very concerned about this matter. In the six years that I have been in the Senate I do not believe I have received more correspondence than I have received from all over Australia, from people of different religious beliefs, even from the Catholic bishops, saying that we should disallow this declaration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney said that we are voting against the declaration. I believe that, if this disallowance motion is carried, we will not be disallowing the instrument because the instrument has already been declared. We are trying to stop this particular declaration being administered in Australia by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the people who have been coming to my office and writing to me look upon some things in life as basic rights. One of them is religious freedom; they see it as a birthright. I believe the last thing they want is for the government, no matter how well intentioned it may be, to interfere with that birthright. As has already been shown by well intentioned moves of the government in the past&mdash;trying to show the way to the rest of the world&mdash;the signing of these UN conventions and treaties has caused all sorts of troubles in our country. I believe that is why we will never see the United States of America&mdash;that great nation with all the freedom it has&mdash;signing these United Nations treaties and conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Harradine, my colleague from Tasmania, has pointed out to this place more than once his concern about the thousands of conventions and treaties that this nation has signed&mdash;treaties that, whether we like it or not, have certain effects on this nation. As a Tasmanian, I can tell honourable senators that Tasmanians have certainly realised just how binding some of them are. The external affairs powers were used to the detriment&mdash;some would say to the benefit&mdash;of Tasmania; nevertheless the state's powers were overridden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average man in the street is fearful of these declarations that are continually being made. While we might say it is the best thing they can have and it is good for them, it is a little like the GST argument. We tried to tell people that it was the best tax available and the best for them, but in the end they were frightened of it. I believe this is a similar type of thing; whilst it may look good on paper and it may be the perfect set of words, they are concerned because it interferes with what is to most people a basic right and a basic freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This declaration is further evidence of the government's attempt to divide our nation. As I said, there are two matters which are considered sacred by most Australians: one is the constitution and the other is religion. In recent months we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seeking to divide our nation on both these issues. He has proved that he will do anything to keep the nation's mind off the real problems at the moment&mdash;that is, the disastrous state of our economy, unemployment and the failed budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear to me, as I said earlier, given the amount of correspondence, telephone calls and whatever that I have received&mdash;not from organised religious bodies, but from people from all facets of society&mdash;that the majority of Australians do not want Australia to have anything to do with this declaration. It is also clear that neither the government nor the Democrats give a damn about what the majority of Australians think. If we proceed with this declaration, it will be against the wishes of the Australian people. It will show the Australian people that the government and the Democrats are more concerned about their own agenda than they are about the wishes of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the definition of intolerance and discrimination contained in the declaration is an unacceptable constraint upon the practising of religion in this country. I say that not just from the viewpoint of the Christian religion, but from the viewpoint of all those who practise their various religions in our country. That is a key point because the adoption by Australia of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief would appear to presuppose that we have some problem in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the opportunity which I have had to examine the religious freedoms available in other nations, I do not think there is any doubt that this country is one of the most tolerant in the world, so why would we want to change it? Australia is a multicultural nation where people live side by side, person to person and religion to religion. It is my view that the only religious intolerance which exists in Australia today is the type of inherently evil intolerance which cannot and would not be eradicated by 20 United Nations declarations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an open-minded and fair nation, it is clear that there are parts of the declaration with which we would all agree. For instance, we all recognise that everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. We already uphold the view that no-one should be subject to discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. But there is a concern&mdash;and I believe it is a genuine one&mdash;that if we incorporate the United Nations declaration into the definition of human rights in the HREOC act, we will not protect religious freedom in Australia; rather we will limit it. This point has been made continually by all my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise the fundamental right which Australia has to conduct our affairs as an independent nation. We also need to acknowledge that the declaration is, at best, a vague and confusing instrument. Having listened to Senator Cooney tonight, I believe that, whilst he did not say it, in the back of his mind he probably believes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to recall the many different interpretations which have flooded our offices to recognise the confusion which this declaration causes. It is a declaration which was 19 tortuous years in the making. Like all such declarations, it was not the best answer, but rather an amalgam of what each participating nation was prepared to agree to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I attended the IPU conference here a couple of weeks ago. If you attended the drafting meetings on motions that we wanted to put down dealing with different nations, you would know just how much give and take there was to come to an acceptable form of words. Who is to say that, at the end of the day, the meanings of those acceptable forms of words that we agreed to cannot be misinterpreted? The motion about Bosnia-Herzegovina was agreed to only as a result of bowing to the wishes of some of the Iranian people who were of a different religion from the other people who were putting forward another point of view. I believe that is how these declarations are arrived at. As I said, they make look very good on paper, but it is the way that they are interpreted at the end of the day which is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example we do not have to look any further than the international convention on human rights which we signed. It had the effect of causing the birth of the racial discrimination act in our country. It is because of that particular act that we have got ourselves into the mess we have with the Mabo problem. I will not argue the rights and the wrongs of it, but one has been a consequence of the other. Because of that racial discrimination act, we now have the Mabo situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Watson touched on the rights of the child convention. I believe that is another one which is coming up in the future, so I will not discuss that tonight. The point is that, even in this place, the former Minister for Justice, who is now either in the Hague, the Holy See or in between, had a couple of reservations about that particular declaration; yet the government did not see fit to change it. That is the reason we will want that convention disallowed. It is not because we are against most of it; it is because, at the end of the day, parts of it can be seen in a different light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration has special and concerning ramifications for our schooling system. This has been pointed out by more than one speaker tonight, but I will go over it again from my own point of view. The situation could easily develop under the declaration where students attending a school of a particular religion could claim that their own religious beliefs are being ignored. They could also claim that any attempt to have them conform with the school's principles of behaviour amounted to religious coercion. The declaration could also lead to a claim of discrimination by minority religious groups over larger religious groups over matters as straightforward as a government grant, for instance. These are some of the concerns that have been coming forward from independent schools. We have an independent school system which relies on government funding and we do not want to put in measures in a way that could interfere with the fair continuation of that system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, I was lucky enough to attend a school in Hobart&mdash;and Senator Harradine would be aware of it&mdash;which is the only Quaker school in the Southern Hemisphere. That particular school, at which I was a boarder more years ago than I wish to remember, was my first taste of different religious groups. On Sunday mornings we would all trot off to our own particular churches. There were some six or eight churches ranging from the Methodist Church through to the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church and the Presbyterian Church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that we attended a Quaker school and we abided by Quaker beliefs. But if one of the minor religious groups attending that school took this particular convention to its utmost conclusion, it could take issue with being taught by a particular person who is of another religion. Its students may say that they had been discriminated against because they would not obey the particular method by which they were being taught or the particular religions that they were asked to go along with. I suppose one could say that they do not have to attend that school and that they could go to another school where the religion might suit them. If that was to happen, I think it would create more divisions in the community and would alienate people in a way that we do not wish to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the HREOC act already covers religious freedom. The definition is vague and inconsistent and the impact of this convention that we are trying to disallow is unclear. It is not clear whether the declaration would condone religious beliefs or practices which Australians might find abhorrent. I am suggesting that the HREOC act should be amended to allow greater scrutiny of these international instruments because I believe that until now they have caused great concern amongst Australian voters. If we do not come up with a better system of scrutinising them, they will continue to be a problem to members of both sides of the chamber, I suspect. I suggest that this might be a good idea in theory, but in practice it will be a disaster and just cause more division in our community when we should be pulling together in all sorts of ways. I look forward very much to hearing the comments of my Tasmanian colleague Senator Harradine. </PARA>

<PARA>I read the motion out because I think that senators ought to realise what they are going to vote upon. I have listened to the arguments that have been advanced against the motion. I have not found them convincing, nor do they really address the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely we all believe that everyone should have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion? They are the most fundamental of human rights. I am not suggesting for a moment that those people who initiated debate in this area as far back as 1960 or 1961 believed other than that the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion were the most fundamental of human rights. I am sure that they believed that these were fundamental human rights and that action by the United Nations would advance and promote these fundamental human rights. We have to realise that these freedoms are the inherent right of every human being. Why? It is because human beings are created by God and the relationship between human beings and the creator is the most fundamental of all. Therefore, we obviously all agree that this is the most fundamental of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important that this right not be misinterpreted by a non-elected organisation. I do not suggest for one moment that an elected organisation is the repository for a perfect interpretation of such instruments. Far less do I agree with what is regarded by authoritarian regimes such as the PRC to be human rights&mdash;that is, those rights that are determined by law in that country. These human rights are inherent, universal and inalienable. They cannot be taken away by states or by human rights and equal opportunity commissions and they cannot be given away by the bearers of those rights. Those rights are needed to ensure the full flourishing of the humanity of each individual who bears those rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not suggest for one moment that the persons who formulated this declaration were ill-intentioned; on the contrary. However, as I see it, there are problems with this declaration. It appears to attempt to qualify the provisions in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was agreed upon by the United Nations in 1948. It appears to qualify provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I believe it is a bit like what happened in Vienna in June of this year when a 28-page document on human rights qualified, in my view, very substantially the very simple six page Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was adopted in 1948.  Certain provisions  of  the  Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief are vague and open to the possibility of misin-terpretation. That is the key to the problem. The motion moved by Senator Vanstone calls for a public debate on this declaration before it becomes an attachment to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that once the declaration becomes an attachment to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act it will bind only the Commonwealth and Commonwealth agencies. However, it will be there and it will be able to be interpreted by the commission in a manner that may be quite contrary to what an individual reading of the declaration might otherwise suggest. It has happened before. Tomorrow, when we come to deal with the rights of the child convention, I will give the Senate an example of where a misinterpretation of the provisions has led to actions by the international monitoring committee which I believe are quite contrary to the intentions of the drafters of that declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the onus is on the government. Why the rush?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . means any agreement or proposed agreement in writing between 2 or more countries which imposes or would impose rights and obligations upon those countries and which is or is intended to be binding upon those countries&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that the declaration that we are considering now is not a treaty, but it is presumably the precursor of a convention down the track. I think it is important under those circumstances to give proper consideration to this matter. If my motion were adopted, I believe that a standing committee of the Senate would be capable of receiving advice and submissions from a whole range of people. That would be the civilised and proper way to go about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a considerable amount of confusion in the minds of the public on this matter. People who have come to Australia from authoritarian or communist countries are concerned. They have memories of their own countries which had beautiful constitutions enshrining freedom of religion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting at all that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will, in fact, interpret the declaration in such a way as to give it a meaning which is not immediately obvious. What I am saying is, why the rush? Why does not the government allow a full and free debate on this question, as is envisaged in the motion which is before us?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why not adopt this motion which will enable community debate and discussion to take place?

I assume that he has had advice on this matter. If that is the case and there is any doubt about it, let us proceed in the manner that is suggested by this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it perfectly clear that I believe, and I am sure the original framers of this declaration in 1962 believed, that religious freedom is the most fundamental of all freedoms.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one person from the government has suggested that this declaration is necessary so far as Australia is concerned. It certainly is necessary so far as some other countries are concerned, but it does not appear to me at least to be necessary for Australia. For the declaration to be now made part of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and for the commission to include it in its educative process will require some sort of interpretation by the commission of the articles of the declaration. I believe that we should act with caution on this most fundamental matter. Therefore, I will support the motion that was originally put forward by Senator Calvert and the opposition. </PARA>

I think what the debate has shown is the degree of isolation that the other side still manages to dwell in. We have seen this afternoon that although Australia has changed enormously and fundamentally over recent years and although the declaration which has been adopted by the government is one that not only has universal support internationally but also has wide ranging support within Australia, there is still one body of thought in this country that cannot adapt to new ideas and cannot adapt to change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 120 or 140 different ethnic communities make up the fabric of our society. Forty-three per cent of Australians have their roots directly overseas and 25 per cent of them come from non-English speaking background countries. But it seems like the opposition has not recognised this fundamental change in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a policy which not only tolerates diversity but also lends encouragement to that diverse nature of our society. We are a modern, tolerant, multicultural society. We recognise diversity; we recognise the rights of minority groups to express, enjoy and celebrate their differences, religions and traditions. It seems that although this has happened, it has missed the Liberal and the National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is a system whereby we support non-English speaking background people being part of this society. We have an inclusive approach; we do not have an approach which is exclusive. In the context of a society which tolerates rather than oppresses, which recognises rather than dismisses, which encourages rather than represses, we had in 1991 an initiative from former Justice Wilson concerning the effects of the Gulf War on the fabric of our society. There was concern about the effects that that war might be having on those who wanted to express their religion, to enjoy their Muslim faith. As a consequence of that, Justice Wilson raised the idea of the government endorsing this declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, Australia has changed. Leading jurists in this country have recognised that change, but the opposition still remains barricaded to the past. One can ask oneself why in 1981 it was the then Liberal-National party government that voted for this particular instrument internationally; why it was part of a universal and unanimous position internationally to adopt this instrument; and why some 12 years later the coalition has gone backwards. Have the Liberal and National parties gone backwards or was it hypocrisy at the time? That is a stark choice for those who may be interested in this debate to try to discern. They either did not believe what they were doing in 1981 or, as Malcolm Fraser said of the Liberal Party just before the election, in economic thought the party has gone backwards. It is obvious in social thought that it has not progressed at all&mdash;it has even gone backwards from 1981. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It was the Liberal-National party government which put up Australia's hand at the United Nations in support of this instrument some 12 years ago. But it is the opposition that continually shows itself to be isolated in terms of the public debate, the social debate and the changes that are going on in this society. As I say, the instrument was adopted unanimously by the United Nations in 1981, and it has not let it rest since then. Earlier this year in the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, under its agenda item on the implementation of the declaration, a resolution was passed calling on states to ensure that their legal systems provided adequate guarantees of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and so on. The UN has maintained an interest in this matter as have people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, as in 1981 when the instrument was adopted unanimously, this year a resolution encouraging member states to implement measures to embrace the instrument was co-sponsored by 38 countries and adopted without a vote. If one wants to see to what degree the opposition is isolated on this matter, one only needs to look at the list of those countries who urged this measure. Those countries not only included Australia, Canada and Ireland but also the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, and the United States of America. Who are those opposite left with? Who are their friends internationally?  There is not one member state. There was unanimous adoption in 1981 and unanimous encouragement now for governments to embrace this international instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, in 1991 Sir Ronald Wilson took the initiative in 1991 and wrote to the Attorney-General on 4 March of that year initiating discussion for the adoption of this instrument. This letter talks about the passage of a unanimous resolution at the World Conference for Religion and Peace Consultation in Melbourne in 1991. This shows how isolated the opposition is. I think the following passage from Sir Ronald's letter should be placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record&mdash;just remember that this was in the aftermath of the Gulf War with the problems that Muslim communities were experiencing at the time. Sir Ronald said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was an interesting sequel to the presentation of my paper on human rights from a religious viewpoint. During question time,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This is at this international conference&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was asked from the floor whether I thought it might be possible for the Commonwealth government to give consideration to including the 1981 UN Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief in the commission's jurisdiction by making a declaration under section 47 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. I answered in the affirmative, whereupon there was spontaneous applause. The meeting then resolved unanimously to that effect and I was asked to bring the suggestion to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again there is universal support internationally, but members of the opposition in their normal way tie themselves to the past and barricade themselves in a vacuum divorced from the changes in our society here and in society internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Ronald Wilson then raised the matter with the Attorney-General. That then led to the consultation in 1991 that Senator Harradine now demands. There was some 18 months to two years of consultation. How much more consultation does one have to have before one gets stagnation through consultation?  Mr Duffy then embarked upon a process of consultation. High level consultation was appropriate having regard to the commission's existing responsibilities. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Attorney-General Duffy wrote to all states attorneys-general in March 1992. He received replies from all states, and only Western Australia and New South Wales had objections. We have since seen those objections to be without substance and as a consequence the government embraced the instrument. </PARA>

There is intention to do this. Unless one does so, there is no problem for Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have another by-product in the debate this afternoon. Opposition senators have been running hot with their arguments and their fear campaign. What does the shadow Attorney-General say about the basic point that those opposite are concerned about? They are concerned that what we are doing by embracing this instrument is to incorporate into domestic law the articles of the instrument. This is the concern of the New South Wales Attorney-General, but it is not a real concern. There is no inconsistency because we do not incorporate into domestic law the provisions of this instrument. Those opposite do not have to believe me and they do not have to believe either the former Attorney-General or the current one. Let me quote what the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Williams, said in the debate in the House of Representatives on 1 September 1993. In total contrast to what has been put by some opposite speakers this afternoon, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition accepts that the ministerial declaration does not of itself make the UN declaration part of Australia's domestic law.&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It could not be clearer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UN declaration does not impose obligations on citizens as a statute does. The opposition also recognises that the powers of the . . . HREOC . . . in relation to investigating conduct that constitutes a breach of human rights are, in practical terms, confined to the actions of the Commonwealth and its agencies.</PARA>
<PARA>The debate this afternoon by those opposite has been fuelled by fear and is of no substance. Their own spokesperson in the other chamber has acknowledged that by embracing this declaration we do not introduce into Australian domestic law the provisions of such declaration. As a consequence the fears of inconsistency that the New South Wales Attorney-General Hannaford had are no longer valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go on for too long on this because we have gone on long enough. The government has embraced this instrument for a number of reasons. The reasons have already been spelt out by the Attorney-General in the House of Representatives. We feel that it is important for us to reaffirm our position in respect to the protection of rights of religious freedom. It is a position that we have held and that is embraced by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to reaffirm it in an instrument which consolidates the jurisprudence on this particular matter. That is the second reason why we are proceeding with this particular provision. The effect of the provision will be to ensure that HREOC will not only ensure that the Commonwealth government, its laws and its practices, conform with the declaration but also will have the function of promoting religious tolerance in the community. We feel that in the context of a diverse multicultural society&mdash;with 120 to 140 different ethnic backgrounds and a whole range of religions&mdash;it is important for us to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has gone on for too long, it has been fuelled by misinformation, and we have had no arguments of substance from the other side. The points raised by the other side have been put to bed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on only part of the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill, my concern being directed to parts 3 to 5. My colleague Senator Patterson is intending to address those parts of the bill which relate to aged care matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is largely about correcting mistakes that were found in earlier legislation. It is yet another in a litany of bills which demonstrate the government's appalling management of its legislative program. Legislation is rushed through this chamber, indeed rushed through both chambers, without adequate scrutiny, and then&mdash;I know my colleagues agree with me&mdash;six months later the government comes crawling back to this parliament with corrections saying that it is very, very sorry but it has got to `fix this up'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in this particular case are relatively minor. The most substantive of them relates to the secrecy provisions in the Health Insurance Act. As honourable senators would be well aware, departmental officers often receive requests for information about public and private hospitals. The information sought includes names and addresses of hospitals, bed capacity, kinds of services provided, teaching status and whether the hospitals are public or private. The incredible thing is that under current legislation this important information is protected, although it is readily available in the public domain. Obviously, it is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 16 allows an authorised officer to release certain specified information about hospitals. Given the availability of this information in the public domain, there is no good reason for opposing this clause. As I said, there is little of substance to debate in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important to debate&mdash;and this bill gives us an opportunity to do so&mdash;is just what has happened to the health care of Australians under this government. The budget has given us some more examples of missed opportunities and the mismanagement by this government of the health care of Australians. We have all seen the back-pedalling by the government on a number of measures. But, even with the changes that appear likely to go through, this is still a regressive budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following pressure from the coalition, the later protests of the Australian Democrats and the Greens and, finally, the caucus revolt, the government announced its intention to rescind the decision that optometrists' fees would no longer be claimable from Medicare. This government went to the last election fighting about the preservation of Medicare; it claimed that the opposition was ready to dismantle Medicare. What sort of government would now have the hide to come in here and start to dismantle Medicare? That is exactly what happened with the optometrists' charges. Under that change which was proposed from 1 November, average Australian families would have been forking out almost $50 for a first consultation with their optometrist and another $25 for a follow-up consultation. Yet, at the moment they pay nothing because over 90 per cent of optometrists bulk-bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes that were announced in the budget constituted a tax on spectacle wearers of $50 a year. Now that that measure has been dumped, there is a $90 million hole in the health budget. We do not know how the government proposes to address this funding shortfall; we will be very interested to find out. It is certainly going to make for some explanations at some stage or other. I think we will be waiting for some time for an answer to that question because the government continues to address some of the very important issues in the health portfolio, and that is but one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget has failed to tackle in any substantive way the real problems in the health portfolio. I draw the attention of honourable senators to the principal savings. They are built on a false edifice. Claims that this budget will reduce medical fraud and overservicing are quite unconvincing, particularly in the light of the government's past performance. The National President of the AMA, Dr Brendan Nelson, has questioned the extent of the savings, as have I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to the reduction of hospital queues. Senator Richardson appears to be conducting a sleight of hand. The government made a great play during the election about how it would do something about hospital queues and, as I recall, there was a promise of $100 million over four years to reduce those queues for elective surgery. These are the queues where your grandmother or your aunty is waiting for a hip operation, or uncle is waiting for a prostate operation; they are waiting in pain for months or years for those operations. So the government, which had been in charge of the health budget for 10 years, turned around at the election and said, `Okay, quick, quick; we'll throw $100 million at it over four years'. If we look very closely at the budget, that is not what the government is doing at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year in an existing program the Labor government committed $48 million to the states and territories to reduce waiting times; this financial year it is allocating only $12.4 million. In a new program this year the government has allocated an additional $12.4 million. So the old program has been reduced by about $36 million and the new program will receive $12.4 million. That is where the sleight of hand comes in. It appears that there will be $23.2 million less available for getting hospital beds in the private sector than last year. So much for the election promise of $100 million over four years. It was not much of a promise anyway because, as Dr Nelson has pointed out, buying private beds for public patients will exacerbate the decline in the number of people who are privately insured. With not enough money coming into the system through encouragement of the private sector, increased rationing is inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Richardson has acknowledged now that he will not be able to buy those beds in the private sector. So the money the government will spend, which is less than we expected it to be spending, will be spent on studies. This is a government which delights in spending taxpayers' money on studies. It has consultants here and consultants there. The government tends to spend quite a bit of the money in the last couple of months of the financial year, I have found. Some of the anecdotal evidence which has come to my attention from various departments is that these things get filed away at the end of the financial year. It has something to do with not losing the funding for the next year, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at other matters. The budget rations the access of members of the general public to pharmaceuticals. They face a higher safety net and when they reach the net they will no longer receive drugs free. Senator Richardson has also recently announced a review of the Medicare benefits schedule. This is a longer term measure since it is to occur over a period of two years starting later this year. He has also said that he will be taking a package of measures to cabinet late this year aimed at addressing the problem of a plummeting number of Australians holding private health cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the trouble is that, on purely irrational and blind ideological grounds, Senator Richardson has ruled out the measure which would best address this problem&mdash;tax incentives to encourage greater participation. It is clear to Blind Freddy and his dog that tax incentives are the best way possible to allow low to middle income earners to afford to stay in private health insurance. The number of people who are on relatively low incomes and who are clinging to their private health insurance like grim death is really very surprising. It is an indication of how important it is to many Australians; yet this government does not recognise the financial difficulty that they are under in trying to maintain that private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson is prepared to sock the wealthy; he is prepared to give a stick to those wealthy, like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who is not prepared to pay for his own private health insurance but insists on using the public sector and taking beds from those who cannot afford private health insurance. Senator Richardson is prepared to deal with people like the Prime Minister; he is not prepared to recognise that people on low to middle incomes want desperately to stay in private health insurance; and he is not prepared to help them through tax incentives. It is a nonsense. If Senator Richardson were to go down any main street in Australia he would find people saying to him, `Please, help us with tax incentives'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be interested to know just what role Senator Richardson played in the decision to increase the price of leaded fuel by 10c a litre as originally promised in the budget, because the government has defended this increase on health grounds&mdash;a concern for children and for the level of lead in their blood. In my view that is a totally specious argument. It is simply a massive tax grab which hurts low income earners more than anyone else. In a searing article just after the budget was brought down, Margo Kingston, the columnist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, gave the lie to this defence. In referring to the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why, he was asked, was he raising the price of leaded petrol above that of unleaded, a tax targeted at the poor who couldn't afford newer cars? He used children to try to sell that one. Apparently it's the children of the poor who suffer most from lead poisoning. Apparently that means their parents should pay extra. He said he was encouraging the poor to buy non-leaded petrol cars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could they, when he'd devalued the value of their current car overnight, increased their petrol prices, and raised the price of newer cars? If he really cared about children's health why didn't he use the funds raised for a rebate to convert old cars to non-leaded petrol?</PARA>
<PARA>I think that expresses it extremely well. The government cannot parade in these hypocritical clothes trying to pretend that that tax grab on fuel is anything to do with the health of children. It is clear to all Australians that the government has been motivated by the need for increased revenue rather than a commitment to improving the health of Australians, in particular, Australian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, as part of his budget, pointed out that there is a need for services for people to die with dignity. It should also be pointed out to the government that Australians would prefer to live with dignity, rather than the continuous struggle to keep their heads above water as a result of this government's mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by pointing out that more than a quarter of all households in Australia are now mainly dependent on welfare. While the major issues at the head of this government are the republic and the flag&mdash;the modern version of the bread and circuses to distract a people in trouble&mdash;one million people are without a job; 100,000 of them are waiting in queues for elective surgery; and more than a quarter of households live on welfare. No wonder the suicide rates among our young are rising. The health and the life of this nation are in jeopardy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I will look briefly at the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. The Australian Democrats basically have no problem with this legislation. The legislation makes a number of minor amendments, quite a few of which are simply to correct drafting errors. There are two main areas of change. The first is the creation of criminal offences within the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These offences relate to the giving of false or misleading information in support of various applications and submissions made under the act. These applications and submissions are basically for the purpose of obtaining financial assistance from the Commonwealth government or, indeed, for cancelling the right of someone to financial assistance. It has been assumed that false information given under the act came within the ambit of the general provisions of the Crimes Act; however, this has been challenged and the government has now moved to clarify this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes it clear that it is an offence to give false or misleading information in certain circumstances under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act. The Democrats do not have any problems with this move. The government should be able to rely upon the accuracy of information it is given when it is making decisions about the suitability of people to provide aged care services. Other recipients of public funds, for example, social security recipients, are expected to provide accurate information to the government and can be prosecuted if they do not. I cannot see any reason for the providers of nursing homes, hostels and other aged care services not to have the same obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major change is that this bill contains a number of amendments to the National Health Act dealing with nursing homes. The one which has caused some concern in certain sections of the industry is the requirement upon nursing home proprietors to keep records which can verify their entitlement to Commonwealth subsidies for a period of seven years. Again, this is in line with similar requirements placed upon corporations under the taxation law and we do not have any problems with requiring recipients of Commonwealth funds to keep such records. Proprietors should be able to produce valid records in support of their claims, and I do not see that this is in any way onerous or unfair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks of my colleague Senator Newman in relation to the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. The changes are minor. It is another example of the water pouring in through the holes in a colander, with the government inadequately trying to put its fingers around it to stop the water pouring out. The reason this is occurring is that the fundamentals are wrong. They have always been wrong. They will continue to be wrong, because the government does not have the wit to understand what is going wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson, the new Minister for Health, has been racing around the country meeting with every interest group around the place trying to come to terms with it. I have no doubt that Senator Richardson is a person of ability and that he will do his best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, since this government has been in power, the people that were prepared to put money into the system are no longer prepared to do so. It is bankrupt. It is as simple as that. The levy was increased to bring in what appeared to be an increased sum of money and all it did was make up for the numbers that have gone out. Only a little over a third of the population in this country pays any Medicare levy. People do not realise that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we speak to people and ask, `Do you pay a Medicare levy?', they say, `Yes, I pay my Medicare levy'. How much do they pay? It can be as little as $50 a year. They pay their Medicare levy but, because the income level at which the Medicare levy comes in is higher than the taxation level, they may pay as little as $50 a year. They feel that they are entitled to the benefits that they get. The average expenditure on health care for people in Australia is now about $1,700 a year. Because some people pay $50 a year they believe they are entitled to it. That is what they have been sold by the government&mdash;`It costs you nothing. Be in it, mate. You are entitled to it. You are entitled to free health care'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this government has been in power the 75 per cent of the population who were prepared to be covered by private insurance has decreased to less than 40 per cent. In my own state of Queensland, the figure is down to 30 per cent. That may be rock bottom level. The same 30 per cent who are privately insuring are paying the Medicare levy. The rest is coming out of taxation. Any system that is funded by taxation is bust. It is bust because we have an aging population; two-thirds of the health care dollar is spent on people over the age of 60. It is bust because of the cost of technology. The only answer which the government has is rationing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson discovered a couple of months ago that one has to wait two years at the Royal Hobart Hospital&mdash;he believes it is unconscionable&mdash;to get a hip replacement. I have news for him: it is a three-year wait at the Royal Brisbane. In Queensland, the mortality rate whilst waiting for coronary bypass surgery has now exceeded the operative mortality rate. There are people dying on the waiting list. We will not hear about it. People do not like going to the press to complain about this. They are grieving. They are not going to create a fuss about it. The people affected most are those people who are not accustomed to complaining. They have been browbeaten to the extent that they are not willing to come forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland we have had wholesale desertions of doctors from the public hospital system. The answer from the government: `They are money grabbing doctors, getting out of the system; they can make more money outside'. There are 2,000 specialists in Queensland who contribute to the public hospital system for about one-third of the rate that they could earn in the private system. Do we ever hear them being  praised? There is never a mention of them. They do not get a mention at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is bankrupt. Senator Richardson has been floating balloons all over the place that say, `We should privately insure. We have to increase the money people pay to privately insure'. The answer? Give them rebates or tax deductions. Interestingly, the new, brave, Democrat Clinton plan will allow tax deductibility for private insurance in the United States. The big difference is that 80 per cent of premiums in the US are paid by employers. In essence, there will be a compulsory levy in the US which will come out of the pay packets paid for by employers. That is not an answer either. The answers are there; it is as simple as `get out'. Senator Richardson does not have to go running around the country to find out from everybody what the answer is. It has been as plain as a pikestaff for the last 15 years. We should encourage people to go into private insurance, to accept responsibility for their own health and to contribute towards it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be a symbiotic movement between the public and the private sectors. They exist. To a large degree the public sector contributes to health care through major surgeries, such as liver and heart transplantations, which none of us could afford because of their intense cost. The private system can do it equally as well, and in many respects does it better. As a Queenslander I am proud to say that Queensland has the best private hospital system in Australia. For example, more gastroenterology is done in the private hospitals in Brisbane than in the public hospitals because of the long waiting lists there, and the standards are higher. The only machine that can mash up kidney stones, to use the vernacular&mdash;a lithotriptor&mdash;is in a private hospital in Queensland and public hospital patients have to be transported across to have the procedures done there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the success of private medicine&mdash;it aims at excellence. The American system has gone along that way but at tremendous cost to the community. Nobody in their wildest dreams would think that we should go along the same track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allied to this are all the other pressures that Senator Richardson is finding out about now. He will run up against the rock that every Labor health minister has run up against and that is the ideology that the state will provide. He will come to the same conclusion. It will be interesting to see how he goes. There will be some sort of deal, much along the lines that the employer will pay, and there will then be an added cost to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes in this bill in relation to pathology are of a very minor nature, backed by the royal colleges. It will be interesting to see what Senator Richardson does about fraud and overservicing. I have challenged him on numerous occasions. That started off at $400 million, it is now down to about $25 million, and during estimates, the government admitted that it does not really know&mdash;it is just a figure. It will be interesting to see what it actually is. I put the government on notice that in a year's time I will be asking that question. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the national health strategy, at least Senator Richardson has had some wit by cancelling it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. I will be discussing the parts of the bill that Senator Newman did not address. Parts 2 and 6 of this bill make relatively minor changes to legislation governing the aged care program. According to the explanatory memorandum, these changes&mdash;which will commence on the date of royal assent&mdash;will have no financial impact. Part 2 would make it an offence to make a false or misleading statement, knowingly or recklessly, in support of various applications or submissions made under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act. This particular part of the principal act relates to the Commonwealth's subsidies for hostels and community aged care packages. Applications that are included in the proposed section include applications for financial assistance, an approval for a service, an approval to transfer a service or an approval as an approved operator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offence would also apply to documents given to the minister, unless it is indicated that the document contains false or misleading information and reasonable steps are taken to provide the correct information to the minister. The maximum penalty laid down in the legislation is five years imprisonment. A similar offence with a similar penalty would also be introduced for making a false or misleading statement in relation to submissions seeking to contest a ministerial decision to revoke an approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the proposed sections which would introduce an important safeguard into the parent act. Until now there has been a need to rely on the general offences under the crimes act. The government has indicated that the application of these general offences in this particular circumstance has been called into question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 6 of the bill provides that nursing home records which are required for the verification of claims for Commonwealth benefits under the national health act shall be retained for seven financial years. This seven-year retention requirement would also apply to any other records that the secretary requires a proprietor to keep as a result of serving a notice in writing. The seven-year financial period will commence on 1 July, after the financial year to which the records relate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed section will apply to records held at the date of royal assent. It would be appreciated if the minister could inform me as to when exactly the seven-year period starts and finishes for records that are held at the date of royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penalty for not keeping such records for seven financial years is 200 penalty units. For those who are used to having their fines defined in hard currency, the government is changing the way that it expresses penalties under various acts. Amendments made last year to sections 4AA and 4BB of the crimes act introduced a penalty unit with a monetary value of one hundred dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relating penalties to a central reference point in the crimes act means that the government does not continually have to update the value of penalties with inflation in a large number of relevant Commonwealth acts. However, this is not of much consolation to a nursing home proprietor who has no idea of the definition or monetary value of a penalty unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I was acutely aware of how difficult it is, with the amount of delegated legislation that there is, for members of the public to access information. The more difficult it is to access information about laws pertaining to citizens, the more likely it is that they will have to seek legal assistance to actually get that information. I think we should do everything in our power to make the law as accessible to people as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, if the proprietor does not know the definition or the monetary value of a penalty unit, then he or she needs to know where to go to find that information. In the committee stage I will request that the government insert a footnote in the relevant sections outlining the fact that the penalty unit system stems from section 4AA of the crimes act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it ponders over whether it will agree to this very reasonable request, the government may like to explain why the seven-year retention provision carries a maximum penalty of 200 units, which is double the maximum penalty for a breach of the general retention provisions for nursing homes under section 61 of the national health act. It would also be useful if the government could explain to me and to other honourable senators why it has seen fit to increase the maximum penalties in relation to the retention of records from $1,000 in 1991 to the equivalent of $20,000 in 1993. In anyone's estimates this would seem like a fairly severe price hike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition will not oppose the introduction of the seven-year retention provision, it is important to point out that this amendment has been made necessary as a direct result of the department's totally unacceptable tardiness in validating expenditure by nursing homes under the post-1987 funding system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators no doubt will be aware, I originally intended to move a motion at the second reading stage to set up a Senate inquiry into the validation of nursing home expenditure. I think that motion was circulated in the chamber, but I am indicating that I will not be moving that motion in the committee stage of the bill. However, as indicated by a notice of motion earlier today, I now intend to pursue this matter in the business of the Senate. The coalition will not oppose those parts of the bill relating to the aged care portfolio. </PARA>

I think we have learnt a lesson from this piece of legislation; we should not have to keep relearning it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very great honour for me to be invited by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) to represent the opposition and join the delegation of veterans to visit France and Belgium to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the ending of the First World War. It was also a personal pleasure for a number of reasons, not the least because I have a deep interest in military affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The involvement of the Australian Commonwealth Military Forces, the AIF, in Belgium and later in France was the foundation on which Australia's very successful military capability was built. In my judgment, Gallipoli does not have its correct place in Australia's military history. Gallipoli tends to be seen as the most important campaign by Australian forces in the First World War. It certainly is the most publicised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Gallipoli, the AIF fought with incredible determination and courage. It was the first major campaign of a new and untried force. But it was a force that had no military experience to draw on. While it fought valiantly and courageously and with great enthusiasm, victory did not come its way. In a sense, the military lessons to be learned by the Australian Army as a consequence of the Gallipoli campaign were limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in Belgium in the Ypres Salient in 1916 and 1917 and in the Somme Valley in 1918 that the AIF learnt its skill at arms and became the finest infantry force fighting in that war. It learned there what needed to be done to be successful in the field of battle. From Passchendaele and Messines in Flanders, from Fromelles, where the 5th Division was almost wiped out, Pozieres, where the 1st and 2nd Division lost more killed and wounded than Australia has ever lost before or since in one area, and at Bullecourt lessons were learnt that culminated in the brilliant successes from March 1918 to final victory in November 1918. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1918, the first German breakthrough occurred. The German army drove westward with the objective of capturing Amiens and splitting the British armies in the north from the broken and exhausted French armies in the south. The five Australian divisions rushed down from the north, held the advance of the German armies for all time when they were within site of Amiens. After the German breakthrough was held, the Australian divisions, with the Canadians, the New Zealanders, the British army and, finally, the newly arrived Americans, drove eastward until the German forces capitulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through those eight or nine months leading up to the armistice, the combat abilities and successes of the AIF took second place to no other army. The AIF became the dominant force in the Somme Valley. After the main breakthrough, the German army had been halted. In April, the Germans captured the high ground in which the town of Villers-Bretonneux was situated. In a brilliant night action, mounted immediately after the seizure of the town and with only hours of preparation, Brigadier Glasgow's 13th Brigade and Brigadier Elliott's 15th Brigade retook Villers-Bretonneux. From there, the five AIF divisions, fighting together, displaced the German army from the Somme Valley through to the Hindenberg line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hamel, a small town just east of Villers-Bretonneux, was one of the first of those victories. In a sense, Hamel is the site of the first occasion when modern land warfare tactics were used. By this time, the Australian Army was operating under its own leaders. General Monash was now the Australian Corps Commander. Monash, a civilian soldier and engineer from Melbourne, was the outstanding general of the war. Of very high intelligence, he had a flexible, innovative mind and, though older than many of his contemporary generals, he was always ready to develop and apply new tactics after he had meticulously thought through every detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My father was an officer in one of the infantry battalions. I remember him telling me on many occasions how Monash used to conduct his briefings. Every detail was meticulously and lucidly laid out and every officer present, even the most junior, was encouraged to comment on the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hamel was of great interest. The infantry advanced behind a complex artillery fire plan which lifted at set intervals before the advancing waves of attacking infantry. That had been done many times before. But in Hamel there were two new innovations. Monash had seen a demonstration by the Tank Corps of the new mark V tank. After the disaster at Bullecourt in April 1917, when the earlier tanks failed completely with huge casualties for the Australians, the armoured corps or the Tank Corps, as it was called then, was persona non grata with the AIF. Monash saw the greatly increased capabilities of the new mark Vs and saw the opportunity of using them with infantry to break the barbed wire entanglements and suppress the deadly machine-gun posts. He integrated into his plan the use of armour and infantry working together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawrence Wackett, from 3 Squadron of the Australian Flying Corps, had developed a technique of parachuting machine-gun ammunition into the battlefield into the hands of the advancing infantry. The supply of ammunition, particularly machine-gun ammunition, in an advance was a major problem. It all had to be carried by soldiers over broken ground under fire. In putting these elements together, Monash developed the tactics of the modern battlefield and broke, albeit still at a high human cost, the dominance of barbed wire and fixed defences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hamel also marked the first occasion that the American forces fought with Australians. Some of the early American units were attached to the 11th Brigade for experience. By a strange coincidence, the battle of Hamel took place on 4 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the terrible background of attrition in that war, where battles usually lasted many days, weeks or months for negligible gains in territory and casualty lists that ran into thousands, Monash planned the battle of Hamel to take only 90 minutes. The 11th Brigade of the AIF completed this task in 93 minutes. From there, the AIF advanced inexorably up the Somme Valley, taking all before it until victory was assured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these campaigns of 1918, the Australians displayed enormous courage and self-sacrifice, strong battle discipline, flexibility in planning and high intelligence. The success of 1918 was the anvil on which the abilities and reputation of the Australian Army was forged. When thoroughly trained, adequately equipped and properly led, those achievements of 1918, which made the Australian Army second to none in the field of combat, are still possessed by the Australian Army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The achievements of 1918 were bought at a terrible price. Australia's population then was under five million. Over 330,000 Australians volunteered to fight in the armed services. One out of every two soldiers was wounded, some more than once. Over 60,000 died on the field of battle or directly from wounds sustained in battle. It was a huge price to pay for a young nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To commemorate these great events, the government decided to send a delegation of veterans, war widows and descendants of veterans to visit the battlefields of France and Belgium. Fourteen veterans were selected, along with seven widows of servicemen who served in the First World War and two legatees, one whose grandfather and the other whose great grandfather had served. The delegation was led by Senator Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, it was a great honour for me to be invited. My father had served as an infantry officer in one of the battalions of the third division. He served in all the campaigns of that great division from its first days to its last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central focus of the delegation was the veterans themselves. The youngest was 93, with the great majority 94, 95 or 96. What marvellous people they were. They were all very alert and lucid. Intellectually, they belied their years. Their enthusiasm for everything, the long hours of travel and engagements, their unfailing high spirits and goodwill with never a cross word or complaint, was an inspiration. I must say that I had some worries beforehand about how they would handle the fatigue and the friction that is inevitable on such a visit to the other side of the world. There was a great deal of activity packed into only 10 days. They loved every minute of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story is told of one of the veterans on the Gallipoli visit. When someone expressed concern to him that the visit might be too stressful and he might not come back, his response was, `Well, that does not matter. We nearly didn't come home the first time we were at Gallipoli and everything after that been a bonus'. The same spirit clearly moved those on the Western Front delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the delegation&mdash;and by any standards it was very successful&mdash;rested on the planning of the entire operation. The overall planning was performed by Admiral Ralph from the Repatriation Commission. Drawing on the experience gained from the Gallipoli trip, Admiral Ralph did a marvellous job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heart of the success of the visit in a real sense was the medical planning under the aegis of Dr Graham Killer, the Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. It is a daunting task to accept the responsibility for the welfare of 14 veterans in their mid-90s and seven widows of their former comrades of similarly advanced years. But the medical planning really was superb. Everything was thought of; everything was thought through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three medical officers travelled with the delegation. As well as Dr Killer, Dr Glenda Powell, a specialist gerontologist from Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital in Brisbane and Group Captain Roger Capps, a specialist in aviation medicine, formed this team. They were supported by 11 carers&mdash;men and women from the repatriation hospitals and from the air force&mdash;who provided the nursing services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another life, I spent a considerable portion of my time working in hospitals and I say without hesitation that the devoted attention and the quality of service of the carers for their wards could not have been improved upon. It was exemplary&mdash;nothing was too much trouble&mdash;24 hours a day from departure in Sydney until we returned. The proof of that lies in the fact that everyone in the delegation stepped off the plane in Sydney. That was an enormous achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, about 10 days after we returned Hugh O'Donnell passed away, but I can confidently say that he never regretted embarking on the pilgrimage. Like all his comrades, he viewed it as a privilege and obligation to pay homage to those who did not return in 1918. It was a privilege for all of us to have had his company for those 10 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was accompanied by an army contingent. This consisted of a military band plus a guard drawn from regulars and reservists under the command of Colonel Vale. Their presence and their ceremonial drills put a very professional seal on all our engagements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The engagements on the program tended to follow a standard format. All the major battlefields of the AIF were visited, as were the memorials to the five divisions and other significant Australian memorials. Usually a guard was posted, an historical address on the significance of the site to Australia was read by Dr McKernan from the Australian War Museum, wreaths were laid by members of the delegation, and the Last Post and the Rouse were played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 occasions, battlefield plaques created by Dr Ross Bastiaan were unveiled. These bronze plaques consisted of a sculptured relief map of the region together with a text in English and French explaining the history of the battles in the area.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Bastiaan, a dentist in private practice in Melbourne, is a notable public spirited Australian. He has rendered great service to the Australian nation with his plaques. Visiting Gallipoli some years ago, he was surprised to find that there was nothing available to explain to the thousands of young Australians who visit each year in increasing numbers what happened on the site. They come because they know the name, but visiting a battlefield 50 or 75 years after all the detritus of battle is gone means that they simply cannot reconstruct what took place. So on his own initiative he started a program of placing large bronze plaques in over 70 sites around the world&mdash;Gallipoli, Singapore, Thailand, Papua New Guinea, France and Belgium to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Bastiaan has taken it on himself to raise the funds from private industry to pay for these plaques. As well, he designs the plaques himself and oversees all the work involved in fabricating, transporting and erecting the plaques on their sites. He has performed a very great service to the Australian public. His plaques will serve future generations of Australians very well as they seek to understand this nation's achievements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reflection, many memories come flooding back. The ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe on Sunday where there was a joint French and Australian wreath laying ceremony at the French national memorial; the ceremony at the Australian memorial at Fuilloy, Villers-Bretonneux; VC Corner, Fromelles, the only Commonwealth war grave cemetery I know of where there are no headstones; marching behind the Australian Army band and guard with colours flying down the</PARA>
<PARA>road from the Cloth Hall in Ypres to the Menin Gate, a road that every one of the five Australian divisions traversed, and the intensely moving service that followed that at the Menin Gate; and finally the ceremonies at the 2nd Division memorial at Mont St Quentin and later at Peronne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish with a human story about that 2nd Division memorial at Mont St Quentin. Mont St Quentin is the dominant physical feature in that area and was taken by the Australians in what General Rawlinson, who was the British 4th Army commander in whose army the Australian corps was placed, described as the finest feat of arms in the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the 3rd Division on the north flank and the 5th on the south, on 29 August the 5th Brigade, which was only at about a third of its strength, fought up the hill without any artillery or armour support and displaced the crack German 2nd Prussian Guards Division. They were later displaced from the hill themselves by a counter attack from the Germans. The 6th Brigade regained the mountain and they were eventually replaced by the 7th Brigade&mdash;the three brigades of the 2nd Division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the veterans we had in the party was Robert Comb from Canberra. He was a Lewis gunner in the attack. Most of the members of his section were killed in the attack. He single-handedly overcame some German machine gun posts and was awarded a Military Medal for his action. At the ceremony, Dr McKernan read an address, wreaths were laid a battlefield plaque was unveiled. When the ceremonials were over, the crowd mulled around. Bob Comb walked over by himself, stood by the plaque, looked out over the valley which dominated Peronne, which was taken shortly after Mont St Quentin, and without saying anything to anyone pulled out a can of Fosters and drank it, savouring every drop. He did not say a word to anyone, but it was quite apparent that this was something that he had planned for years and he got enormous pleasure out of it. Those of us who knew of it, also got enormous pleasure out of his pleasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I congratulate the minister Senator Faulkner on his conduct and the outcome of the delegation. He led it with great distinction. His officers in the Department of Veterans' Affairs can all take high praise for the success of the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not named everyone who was involved, but I think those officials who came along all made a contribution to the outcome; and they made a contribution to the limits of their ability. The visit was executed without any hitches at all. It gave great pleasure and satisfaction to those few who still survive from their 330,000 comrades. The French, as the host nation, gave generous support and reaffirmed those links forged over 70 years ago between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, it was the experience of a lifetime. We few who were in the party had the opportunity to join in the fellowship and partnership with those 14 out of 330,000 of the AIF and traverse once more the scene of their great defeats and losses and their ultimate victories. It was a great privilege to share the fellowship of these men, these living links with those immortals of the AIF who forged Australia's military history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the Senate's edification, I will present another instalment in the series of my attempts to spread some information about the hazards of chemicals in our society. I think I should forewarn honourable senators that the information I am about to share this evening deserves to have a heading of environmental illness and what is called multiple chemical sensitivity, often abbreviated as MCS. The fact is that chemicals are about profits, and therefore politics. It is also an issue that impacts on humans and the environment creating a need for regulation, control and repair. The human consequences of toxic chemical exposure in Australia must urgently be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Announcements from universally respected institutions place the situation in its true perspective. An investigation by a body of 20 prominent American scientists resulted in the Winspread report, which came to light in Wisconsin in the United States in July 1991. Its focus was chemically induced alterations in sexual development&mdash;the wildlife and human connection. The paper discussed the reproductive viability of many species which had been exposed long-term to toxic chemicals. Its conclusion expressed concerns for the future of the human race. The gravity of their comments may well have influenced the World Health Organisation to declare that toxic chemicals and the illness they cause are the plague of the present decade. That claim was made in the Commission on Health and Environment's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Planet&mdash;Our Health</EMPHASIS>, which was presented at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there are many reasons why there is a marked reluctance to accept the notion of chemically induced illness. It has huge implications for governments, employers, insurance companies, chemical manufacturers themselves, their agents and advertisers, and those who have to pay sickness benefits, workers compensation and pensions. There is also a perception that doctors who prescribe drugs which often come from the same sources as many toxic chemicals do not take the issue of chemically induced illness seriously, or they regard all illness as a purely medical problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is the lack of media attention. The media exploits chemical spills, fires and explosions as newsworthy, but the human element that remains long after the drama has ended merits little attention. Quiet suffering does not sell newspapers or increase TV ratings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country considerable amounts of money have been allocated to the treatment and research of a large variety of debilitating illnesses. Yet MCS, with symptoms that are equally serious and equally incapacitating, has not attracted one cent. In Australia it is studiously ignored, despite huge economic ramifications. By contrast, in the United States, Congress has allocated $ 1/4 million for research into MCS to be coordinated by the National Centre for Environmental Health Strategies in New Jersey. Attempting to evade this issue is costing our governments, our employers and our communities far more than coming to terms with chemically induced illness and doing something positive about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">MCS may result from long-term low level exposure to chemicals or single dose acute exposure. Chemicals which cause MCS are endless in variety and include pesticides, household and industrial chemicals, solvents, cleaners, prescription drugs, formaldehyde and cosmetics. Petrochemical substances are frequently involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On becoming sensitised by exposure to one chemical, people develop adverse reactions to a whole range of other substances, such as other chemicals or even food and drinks. The natural environment may also present problems with pollens and grasses to which there was no previous reaction. This sequence is well documented in the literature and is called the `spreading phenomenon'. The single trigger may cause many so-called allergies to emerge. These are all symptoms of multiple chemical sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mainstream medical profession suspects that MCS is the result of a viral infection, although to date research has found no germs which have been linked to the onset of the disease. This has not stopped the medical profession from typically inventing a variety of other names to describe its symptoms, including myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, post viral syndrome, 20th century disease, yuppie flu and so on. I am sure that honourable senators have heard some of these trendy names that have been applied. Many of these names have strong clinical overtones. It is as though the medical profession, by inventing this menu, seeks to confine the illness to the traditional medical domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Physical manifestations of MCS range from profound fatigue, aching joints and muscles, to full scale gastric, circulatory, respiratory and musculoskeletal involvement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be so. The symptoms of MCS, I hasten to add, often also involve generalised pain and mood swings; concentration and memory lapses are frequently reported, as are dermal ulceration and rashes. Many chemical victims tell of recurrent flu-like episodes linked to periodic contamination of their environment with substances to which they become sensitised. Toxic agents, after doing their damage, often leave the body with no residual signs, except in the case of substances like organochlorines, lead and some other elements which may remain in the tissues permanently or for an extended period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many classically trained doctors focus on germs as a cause of an illness, as they have long done, and often write off their MCS patients presenting with a cluster of symptoms as hypochondriacs or malingerers because no germs can be found. Chemical victims are either sent packing or told that they are depressed, and have even been sent to psychiatric hospitals for electroconvulsive therapy. Sometimes they are diagnosed as suffering from the mysterious myalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome. Such a diagnosis leaves patients in a state of limbo while the search for the missing germs or viruses continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Patients diagnosed as having ME or chronic fatigue syndrome should instead be suspected of suffering from MCS. If that were done, questions asked about chemical exposure at work or home, or about chemical sensitivities, would suggest a new holistic approach. In Australia, unfortunately, this approach has been overlooked in the quest for orthodox answers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is even worse because prescription drugs often unwittingly exaggerate the MCS patient's symptoms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no cure except complete isolation from the source of contamination, additional rest when necessary, a stress free lifestyle, sufficient vitamin supplements and a diet free of all known allergens. This allows a prospect of recovery with differing degrees of improvement according to the individual affected. Improvement lasts up until the next exposure, whereas sensitisation is enduring and many patients report that such sensitisation is in fact life altering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 at the Wistar Institute in the United States, researcher Dr Elaine de Freitas discovered, during a research project, that many of the ME, or myalgic encephalomyelitis, patients she was investigating were, coincidentally, sensitive to a variety of chemicals. This in itself gives rise to the question: which came first, the chicken or the egg? That was the sort of situation that she was faced with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, the New Jersey Health Department in the United States, concerned by the spread of environmental illnesses, commissioned a study by Professor Nicholas Ashford and Dr Claudia Miller into MCS. Their report won the World Health Organisation's Macedo Award in 1990. It is a landmark text in the recognition of the disease and the concerns this addresses have been echoed elsewhere in the United States and Canada, but not in Australia. In 1989 the Californian Attorney-General included MCS in recommendations in the final report on disability. Similar recommendations have also been recorded in the San Francisco mayor's draft disability report in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States environmental illness and its consequence, MCS, has been accepted as a legitimate medical condition and is listed in the social security manual. This means that people with MCS are able to obtain income support, a pension or sickness benefit. Medical recognition in the United States is more readily available than in Australia because they are 13 years ahead of us with regard to research in this matter. We are in fact retracing ground already covered with technology that is out of date.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Environmental Illness and MCS can be likened to an iceberg, showing only the visible tip of its immensity. The US National Academy of Sciences has estimated that 15% of the American population is adversely affected by chemicals which should alert Australian authorities to the gravity of the situation, particularly since many chemicals long since banned or restricted overseas, are still freely being used here. Some of these are DDT, Vapan, Prothiopos, Halaxyfop-methyl. MCS deserves recognition, acceptance and appropriate treatment like any other illness or injury, particularly as its effects are more enduring and far reaching than many other illnesses.</PARA>

The Auditor-General sees a pressing need for a new east coast armaments complex, ECAC, to replace the Kingswood and Newington depots. The Democrats agree; however, the government has only said that it will move Newington. We would be very interested to hear from the minister on the future of Kingswood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has dragged its feet on ECAC. Because the defence department and the minister have been fixated on building ECAC at Jervis Bay, they have repeatedly delayed taking a submission to cabinet, apparently in the vain hope that the opposition would just go away. Well, it has not and the government should bite the bullet and rule out Jervis Bay. There is no serious support for Jervis Bay in cabinet, yet the navy is still running a promotional campaign to drum up local support. This charade has to stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report notes, attention has been given to alternative sites for an ECAC, including Port Curtis near Gladstone, Point Wilson in Port Phillip Bay and Twofold Bay near Eden. The Auditor-General has found that the studies of alternative sites have been inadequate and that a new study with a broad based input is needed. That is a damning indictment of the department, with which the Democrats agree. The ECAC issue should be brought out of the closet and into the public domain. The secrecy has gone on for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auditor believes that plans for ECAC should be developed as part of a comprehensive explosive ordnance plan. The Democrats agree and would like to know why this has not happened before. We would add that the ECAC decision must be made as part of a naval facilities plan, especially given the well-sourced rumours that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is investigating the relocation of other naval facilities now in Sydney. Again, a piecemeal approach should be avoided. ECAC should be considered within a total facilities plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our opinion, Gladstone has clear advantages as an ECAC site, particularly if the fleet base is moved there at a later date. Point Wilson has other virtues but comes equipped with one large obstacle: it is also the planned site of a chemical storage site to replace Coode Island in Melbourne's western suburbs and the two would not be compatible on present planning. We know that Defence has commissioned a Department of Administrative Services study on whether both facilities can be located at Point Wilson, separated by an appropriate safety zone. We have approached Senator Ray for a copy of the study and we would like him to expedite its release to cast some light on the ECAC debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time the ECAC decision was finally made and made properly. The minister should concede that Jervis Bay is out of the question and that the public should be brought into the decision making process. This report underlines the fact that his department has failed to take an objective look at this issue. It is time someone else had a go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise this evening a very serious matter and a very sorry matter. It shows the human cost of actions by people in the Public Service who do not appreciate that they are dealing with real people and real victims, in many cases, of grave injustices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This story is about a woman called Mrs Nola Sillars. Mrs Nola Sillars cannot tell her story because on 10 September she took her life. She took her life in exasperation at what she saw as an uncooperative bureaucracy and a legal system in relation to corporations which was very difficult to understand. Having discussed the matter with her surviving partner, I thought it appropriate that we lay these matters before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Sillars was married originally to a gentleman called Mr Ian Sillars and they lived in Western Australia. They jointly owned, through a company called Ticket Seal International Pty Ltd, the machinery and the rights to produce scratch-off lottery tickets and scratch-off promotional tickets that some honourable senators may have received in places such as McDonald's and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr and Mrs Sillars had a marital separation in early 1983 and she sought some legal advice. In retrospect, I think the legal advice she received was poor, to say the least. It may also have been that the legal advice she received was not given in her best interests. She sought to have the assets of the company and the associated family assets frozen, for the creditors to be paid, and then to sort out the financial arrangements between herself and her husband. It seems as though she was advised that the appropriate way to do that was not to put the company into liquidation, a belief that she held for the remainder of her life. I believe that she may have been poorly advised in that and that, had a separate course of action been followed, maybe this problem would not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears, however, that her solicitor was not diligent in pursuing Mrs Sillars's instructions. I also note that her solicitor later served a gaol sentence in Western Australia for matters arising from misconduct during the course of his professional duties, but not in relation to Mrs Sillars's case. Mrs Sillars, however, believed that he should have been gaoled for misconduct in relation to her case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, it appears that her husband took the assets of the company&mdash;the machinery, the rights, the contracts and everything&mdash;went to Sydney and continued to trade under the name, not of Ticket Seal International Pty Ltd, but Ticket Seal International Sydney. My office has conducted company searches with the Australian Securities Commission and although we can find Ticket Seal International Pty Ltd, which is now a company in liquidation, there seems no evidence that there was ever a Ticket Seal International Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even more disturbing is that, before the company in Western Australia was liquidated, Mr Sillars alienated all of the assets of the company for the princely sum of $5,000&mdash;what is known in the insolvency game as the sideways shuffle: all of the assets go one way and all of the liabilities stay where they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Sillars had extreme difficulty in trying to get an amicable solution to this. During the disputation her 12-year-old daughter was also kidnapped from her. I understand that she did not see her after that time. She sought, with no success, to have Mr Sillars brought to justice for the things that he had done. The fraud squad in Western Australia looked at it and seemed to have arrived at the conclusion that it was too difficult. It subsequently appeared that after much pressure from Mrs Sillars the liquidator of the company did form a view that Mr Sillars's conduct was legally unsatisfactory. But Mr Sillars cannot be brought to answer for that because he has fled to the United States and shows little intention of returning to this jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern was in relation to Mrs Sillars's attempts to get some explanation from the Australian Securities Commission as to what had happened. Her letters to the Australian Securities Commission are truly depressing. There is one letter on the file dated 11 November 1992 pointing out that in that year she had written to the Australian Securities Commission on 11 October, 16 October, 22 October and 26 October. She also wrote to the Australian Securities Commission on 15 December and again on 26 January this year. What she sought was some information in relation to the winding-up of the company. In particular, she sought to be assured that the information that she had provided at what she obviously thought could have been a grave risk to her own personal safety had been acted upon. The Australian Securities Commission was very unwilling to provide the information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, on 12 February 1993, a letter was received by Mrs Sillars. In fairness to the ASC, it is not a bad letter, but it could have gone further. It indicates that the liquidator of the company spent six years pursuing a preference action which was subsequently lost. I do not pass any judgment on that, but it does seem very strange that it would take six years to bring and pursue a preference action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that the liquidator sought advice as to whether Mr Sillars could be pursued in relation to what was described as possible bankruptcy action and the outcome of a charging action relating to another company, but it appeared that there was no possibility of bringing him to justice. One wonders, however, why this conclusion was not arrived at until after Mr Sillars had had ample opportunity to strip the company bare and flee the jurisdiction. That should be a source of some concern. The Securities Commission refused to release the section 418 report which dealt with these matters in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Sillars, being both a former director of and contributory to the company, was also a person against whom it may have been possible to raise imputations if one were not seeking to form an honest opinion of the facts. Having looked at the file, I do not believe there is any ground for believing that Mrs Sillars acted in anything other than the best interests of the creditors, her family and her good name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was so frustrated by this that she contacted me and other senators, seeking assistance, to get the relevant information released to her. On 10 September she gave up waiting and took her own life. On 15 September my staff received a letter from the Australian Securities Commission, which appears a little confused. It states that thus far the commission has not had to consider the question of whether or not a section 533 report or a section 418 report is available for access pursuant to the FOI act. One of the concerning things is that Mrs Sillars did not have the resources to pay the costs associated with an FOI application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people have given information to assist organisations such as the Australian Securities Commission or people who are charged with responsibility under the corporations law, perhaps consideration ought to be given to waiving those charges. I think it is also necessary for us to consider whether it is possible to release to people information contained in some reports which at least shows them that their cooperative action has been worth while. It may be that some sort of briefing information can be provided under privilege. It may be that edited forms of the documents can be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this makes much difference now, I suppose, to Mrs Sillars. The wishes of her family are that this matter be pursued and that we attempt to get a change in attitude so that dreadful situations like this do not happen again. I cannot help reflecting on the conversation I had with her partner. She was fortunate enough in the last years of her life to have a loving and caring partner in Sydney. His stated wish to her on many occasions was that maybe she should give up this fight. He wanted her to settle down and for them to get married. I have spoken with him. He is a very good man and a man who is immensely upset by what has occurred. I wish to place on the record here, in this place, at this time, my condolences to him, to Mrs Sillars's surviving family and to the people who attempted to support her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that those who could have been more cooperative in the discharge of their public duties will recognise that real people bear the costs of their inaction and that they have an obligation to everybody to discharge their duty properly. I hope that this may be a salutary lesson and that we will never again have to go through this dreadful situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to inform the Senate of the successful completion of the recent mission overseas to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the battles on the Western Front. Fourteen World War I veterans, seven war widows and two junior legatees joined me, Senator MacGibbon and many others on a mission which left for France on Friday, 27 August, and returned on the morning of Monday, 6 September. The opposition was ably represented by Senator MacGibbon. The honourable member for Bennelong, Mr John Howard, from the House of Representatives, also participated in the mission. Although it was in a personal capacity, it was certainly to a very significant extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group included Mr August Band, Mr Edward Field, Mr Edward Smout and Mrs Myrtle Shand from Queensland; Mr Bruce Heathcote, Mr Howard Pope, Mr Hugh O'Donnell and Mrs Gwen Serviss from South Australia; Mr Stanley Graham, Mr William Davies, Mr Alexander Griffiths and Mrs Pat Graham from New South Wales; Mr Harry Poulton and Mrs Margaret Burns from Victoria; Mr Robert Comb and Mrs Erica Weller from the ACT; Mr Robert Lewis, Mr Alfred Evans and Mrs Florence Carr from Tasmania; and we were accompanied by Mr Peter Casserly and Mrs Zoe Hall from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The junior legatees accompanying the mission were Elizabeth Livingstone, age 17, of Queensland and Daniel Stein, aged 16, of Western Australia. As a tribute to the distinguished Commander of the Australian Army Corps in 1918, Lieutenant-General Sir John Monash, Monash University sponsored officer cadet Erin Palmer, a student and member of the university regiment. The Australian people were represented at the major commemorative ceremonies by the Governor-General, Bill Hayden, and Mrs Hayden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mission was supported in its tributes by a ceremonial guard and band drawn from the land command of the Australian Defence Force. Many of them were selected because they have family or regimental connections to the Western Front. The mission left on a high note with a farewell by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) from Lady Davidson Hospital followed by a gathering of well wishers and a civic farewell at the Sydney Town Hall. I believe that really set the scene for the entire visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand the extensive media coverage of the mission conveyed, it was a most moving and enlightening experience for all those involved and certainly did pay appropriate tribute to the 46,000 Australians who died on the Western Front. For the diggers, who had of course experienced the horrors of war there, and the war widows, whose husbands fought there, it was a very emotional experience indeed. I think all members of the mission found the experience extraordinarily moving and certainly one that they will never forget. I think it is properly and genuinely described as the experience of a lifetime for all involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The itinerary for the week of the mission included commemorative events at all the significant battlefields where Australians fought and coincided with the 75th anniversary of the great Australian victories at Mont St Quentin and Peronne. The mission began with a mass at Les Invalides on the morning of Sunday 29 August, followed by a commemoration service at the Arc de Triomphe and a reception at the Australian Embassy attended by the Governor-General and Mrs Hayden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day the mission travelled to Villers-Bretonneux for the first major commemoration ceremony at the Australian memorial and in the presence of the Governor-General. This was followed by wreath laying ceremonies at the 3rd Division memorial at Sally-le-Sec and the 1st Australian Division memorial at Pozieres. A civic reception was held that night in the magnificent Arras Town Hall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Wednesday, 1 September the mission travelled to Fromelles for a wreath laying ceremony at the VC Corner cemetery and then on to Ypres to visit the battlefield sites and lay wreaths at the 5th Division memorial at Polygon Wood. After a civic reception at the Cloth Hall in Ypres, the ADF contingent marched through the town to the Menin Gate memorial which now, of course, is very much a peaceful landscape and very different from that experienced by the predecessors of that ADF contingent during the First World War. That evening a major commemoration ceremony was held at the Menin Gate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Thursday, members of the mission visited the Australian Memorial at Bullecourt and on Friday, 3 September we travelled to Mont St Quentin where wreaths were laid at the 2nd Division memorial. Meanwhile, the ADF guard and band assembled at the Peronne Town Hall, marched from there to L'Historiale where the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Peronne by Australian forces on 3 September 1918 was commemorated. A wreath was also laid at the 4th Division memorial at Bellenglise before the mission returned to Paris and from there back to Australia the next day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention that a souvenir issue of the mission's itinerary, which sets out in some detail the return to the Western Front mission, is being produced jointly by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Defence Force Journal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the major battlefields we visited a total of 11 large plaques sculpted by Dr Ross Bastiaan were unveiled. The plaques inform visitors of the activities of Australian soldiers in the local area during World War I. I think they are a splendid and certainly innovative addition to our historical record. I join others in sincerely thanking Dr Bastiaan and his sponsors for the fine work and community spirit that they have shown in producing these plaques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the ceremonies at the battlefields, the Last Post was sounded on the bugle used by Corporal Claude Potter to rally the 8th Battalion into action on the Somme. It was lent by his son Mr Graham Potter of Western Australia and I would like to thank him for his generous gesture. At each ceremony the scene was set by the delivery of a prologue by the Deputy Director of the Australian War Memorial, Dr Michael McKernan. These prologues vividly described the actions of Australians who fought in the area in World War I and the significance of each of the sites we visited to Australia's military history. The prologues set the scene for the ceremonies and certainly, I believe, brought into focus the purpose of the commemorations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Governor-General hosted a reception in each of the communities associated with the major commemoration ceremonies and also at Fromelles and Bullecourt. These provided opportunities for our veterans and war widows to meet the local people who turned out in very large numbers. I think all of us were very pleased to see a great number of local children paying tribute to the diggers on their return to France and Belgium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to place on the record my thanks to the French government for its generous assistance and logistic support for the ADF ceremonial contingent. In all the areas that we visited, the French community warmly welcomed the mission and joined in the commemorative activities, as did the local communities in Belgium, and they certainly recalled the days in 1916 to 1918 when close links between our nations were established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to commend the Australian Defence Force for the absolutely magnificent way in which it performed its important ceremonial support role during the mission. In my judgment, its participation helped to make the national tribute to those who sacrificed their lives on the Western Front a full and appropriate one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the World War I veterans and the war widows who took part in the mission, I can only join Senator MacGibbon in expressing my highest admiration for their remarkable courage and stamina during the mission. I think it is fair to say that they were an inspiration to all of us on that mission and, I have heard since my return, certainly an inspiration to all at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that everyone who accompanied the mission was really grateful for the opportunity to see at first hand where these veterans had fought, and really appreciated the opportunity to share with them the moving tributes to their fallen comrades. As I said, it was an experience that will never be repeated for any of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, Mr Hugh O'Donnell, who was a veteran from South Australia, died a week after returning from the mission. I am pleased to say that, even though he developed health problems on the trip, he really was determined to participate fully in our mission&mdash;and, indeed, he did just that. On his return to Australia, his health gave rise to some concern and he was admitted to Concord Repatriation General Hospital in Sydney for observation. The Department of Veterans' Affairs flew his wife and daughter to be with him during his last few days and, as I say, he died soon afterwards. It really was a privilege to know such a fine old man, and I certainly express my deepest sympathy to his wife and family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like also to report to the Senate and to the Australian people that our war dead of the Western Front rest certainly in peaceful circumstances, obviously a peace for which they unselfishly gave their lives. It was a great opportunity for us in France and Belgium to see the role that the Commonwealth War Graves Commission plays. I believe that all who were on the mission were genuinely impressed with the way memorials and cemeteries have been kept throughout the Western Front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like also to place on record my gratitude to all those who were involved in organising and conducting such a successful mission. It was planned and it was executed in an absolutely exemplary manner by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The veterans and war widows, who were the focus of the mission, received the very best of care throughout the mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I would like to thank the medical team and the carers who attended to the veterans group with real skill, real commitment and real compassion. I would like to offer the staff of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Defence my thanks, my appreciation and my congratulations for a job very well done. I believe that it is an achievement they can be justly proud of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 75th anniversary commemorations of World War I will culminate on 11 November, Armistice Day, with the dedication of the tomb of the unknown soldier at the Australian War Memorial. This will be the last significant anniversary of the First World War at which surviving Australians from that conflict can be present and in which they can participate. The tomb will provide a solemn and inspirational focal point for the large number of Australians and others who visit the memorial each year. With overseas battlefields, cemeteries and memorials so far away, I think the tomb is going to be a place where visitors can go to grieve, to place a flower of tribute or remembrance, to remember, and to reflect&mdash;and to do that in this country, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I announced on 7 July the names of the veterans and war widows who would be taking part in the 75th anniversary commemorative mission to the Western Front, I observed that there would obviously be very great disappointment amongst those who were selected for the reserve group for the mission but who would not be part of the mission. I invited them at that time to travel to Canberra with a family member or carer, at government expense, to attend the dedication of the tomb of the unknown soldier. I certainly hope they will be able to join us here&mdash;I believe they will&mdash;and I think that this event will be a very fitting climax to the government's very full and significant program of commemorative events to remember and honour Australia's participation in World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, again I would say a sincere thankyou to the veterans, the war widows and all those who accompanied this commemorative mission to the Western Front. I believe that our veterans and war widows really did our country proud in France and Belgium, as did the veterans, of course, before in 1916 to 1918. I know that the whole of the delegation&mdash;everyone on the mission&mdash;was honoured, as I certainly was, to be part of this historic occasion. It is an experience that I will certainly never forget. I am sure that for all those who participated in the mission it is something which will stand as perhaps one of the most important life experiences and certainly something that will stay with us for the remainder of our lives. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No fax dated 29 September was sent from OIB's visits section, which is in Canberra, with the names of people Mr Payne wished to meet. However, a list provided by Mr Payne to the Public Affairs Section at the Embassy in Washington was forwarded to Canberra and I believe it is this fax that the senator is referring to. This document has already been released under an FOI request which was lodged with my department. It was released with certain deletions because it referred to the personal affairs of individuals. The office of the Privacy Commissioner has provided the department's legal branch with preliminary advice that release of the complete document would be contrary to the department's obligations under the Privacy Act. Therefore, the document is attached with deletions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government's efforts were directed at achieving a balanced and detailed account of the state of  the koalas in a well-respected quality magazine. The Public Affairs Section at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC points out that during a number of meetings with Mr Payne, the journalist `was adamant that he wanted to do his own research and develop his own views about the position of the koala. He was essentially not particularly interested in the Embassy view of this issue. The discussions therefore mainly centred on the logistical and administrative arrangements for his travel to Australia. The Embassy did not pay for any travel costs.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) For the Australian Defence Force, unused long service leave lump sum payments accrued up to 17 August 1993 will continue to attract a concessional rate of tax. Future long service leave lump sum entitlements as well as all unused annual leave will be taxed as normal income. As announced in the Budget, existing concessions will remain for bona fide redundancies, invalidities and approved early retirement schemes. This is identical to the way the Budget measures apply to the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme and the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme are not early retirement schemes. They are Funds providing superannuation, invalidity and death benefits and are not to be confused with early retirement schemes which provide for the early termination for employment of employees. The Budget measures have no effect on the two military superannuation schemes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Comcare Australia generally allows all employees 28 days to present their case where an entitlement is under review. Depending on the circumstances of each case, an extension of time may be given. For current employees, the appropriate date for the actual cessation of the payment of benefit is agreed between Comcare Australia and the employing agency. Payments to former employees who are paid directly by Comcare Australia are ceased from the commencement of the next available pay period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The national policy of Telstra (formerly AOTC) allows employees a minimum of 14 days in which to respond to advice of an intention to cease entitlement, or to seek further time to provide fresh evidence. In all other regards, its practice is the same as that of Comcare Australia. Australia Post's national practice is the same as that of Comcare Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. However, an inconsistency of practice with regard to the ceasing of entitlement was identified during an evaluation undertaken by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. The evaluation specifically focused on the consistency of practices and procedures followed by Comcare Australia, Telstra and Australia Post. As a result of the evaluation Telstra issued its national policy regarding advice of intention to cease entitlement.</PARA>
