<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN Secretary General has noted that El Salvador is a model of particular importance for the peaceful resolution of internal conflicts in other parts of the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, as individuals and as part of the Australian community in general, feel that for the first time in the history of El Salvador a real possibility exists for civil society to be the principal force of its own destiny in a truly participatory democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">El Salvador has a rich experience in efficient, productive, self-sustaining peasant communities, both past and present, which could be the foundation of an alternative economic structure. In order to solve existing inequalities, self-governance must be the key factor for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We strongly believe that international and, in particular, Australian assistance at this time can contribute to long-term peace in El Salvador and to a reconciliation process based on mutual understanding between human beings. Hence, we call upon the Australian Government to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Commence discussion with the UN Secretary General about the means by which we may become more actively involved in El Salvador, including through the provision of Australian personnel for ONUSAL, UNHCR, UNV.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Send an Australian Government delegation to visit El Salvador in early 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">  TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL   (No. 2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It includes a number of measures announced in the Prime Minister's "Investing in the Nation" statement on 9 February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures are the introduction of a general investment allowance; the reduction in the rate of tax for most companies in Australia from 39 per cent to 33 per cent; the introduction of revised company tax collection arrangements; and an extension of the child care exemption currently available to priority access payments to eligible child care centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes some amendments to the foreign investment fund measures enacted by the Government late last year; an income tax exemption for the pay and allowances of Defence Force and Federal Police personnel serving in certain areas; and an amendment to the secrecy provisions to provide certain information concerning unlawful immigrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Lastly, the Bill includes a law improvement measure by proposing the amendments of the gift provisions to improve the overall readability of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the changes to the company tax regime introduced by this Bill will act as an important stimulus to business investment in this country. They will increase the level of profits companies can retain to finance expansion and future investment, and improve the attractiveness of Australia for investment by both Australian and foreign investors. Together with the changes already made by the Government to provide full dividend imputation and to improve Australia's depreciation provisions, the measures I am introducing today will provide Australian industry with a most competitive and supportive business tax environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General Investment Allowance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces the general investment allowance foreshadowed in the Prime Minister's "Investing in the Nation" statement of 9 February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A general investment allowance, which will provide an additional short-term incentive for investment, is to be available for eligible plant and equipment acquired or commenced to be constructed between 8 February 1993 and 1 July 1994 and which is first used for the purpose of producing assessable income, or installed ready for such use, before 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allowance, which will be deductible in the year eligible property is first used, will be at the rate of 10% and will be additional to both depreciation and the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general investment allowance will operate similarly to the development allowance, the principal differences being that the capital cost of a unit of property must be not less than $3000 and that the expenditure need not be in relation to a project that qualifies for the development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To qualify, property must be plant or articles, within the meaning of the depreciation provisions, acquired or constructed by a taxpayer solely for use in Australia in the production of assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain items will not qualify for the allowance including property deductible under certain provisions providing a special basis of deduction, passenger motor vehicles, household appliances, furniture, fixtures and fittings (unless for use in the entertainment/tourist accommodation industry), artwork, books, non-protective clothing and accessories, and aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The property must be retained by the taxpayer for at least 12 months and must not, in that period, be made available for use by other persons or be used either outside Australia or otherwise than for producing assessable income. Further, the allowance can be withdrawn at any time if property is acquired or constructed by taxpayers with the intention of dealing with it in a disqualifying manner even after the first 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allowance will be available to leasing companies if lessees contract to use the  property for not less than 4 years. Lessors will have the option to transfer some or all of their entitlement to the allowance from leased property to the lessee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure is estimated to cost $130m in 1993-94, $330m in 1994-95 and $270m in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Company Tax Rates Reduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will reduce the rate of tax for most companies in Australia from 39 per cent to 33 per cent by amending the Income Tax Rates Act 1986. It will also reduce the rate of tax for Pooled Development Funds from 30 per cent to 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will ensure that Australia continues to be an attractive location for business investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction of the rate of tax on company profits to 33 per cent will improve Australia's attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment. A 33 per cent company tax rate compares favourably with the rates prevailing in the major economies from which Australia draws most of its foreign direct investment. Lower company rates will also ensure that Australian investment will be less likely to locate offshore simply because of more attractive tax regimes in other countries, especially in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cutting the company tax rate will not induce a rush to incorporate for tax avoidance reasons. The Australian Taxation Office advises that, based on the most recent Court authorities, Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provides an adequate response to attempts to alienate income from personal services for tax purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rates will apply to the 1993-94 income year and subsequent years of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will result in consequential amendments to the franking of dividends provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These consequential amendments will be introduced in a later Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction in the company tax rate will, after allowing for some clawback through the imputation system, cost the revenue $0.4 billion in 1993-94, $1.8 billion in 1994-95, $1.6 billion in 1995-96 and $1.7 billion in 1996-97. The Pooled Development Fund rate cut will cost an additional $3.0 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Company tax instalment system</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will give effect to the revised company tax collection arrangements announced on 9 February 1993 by the Prime Minister in his "Investing in the Nation" statement. This measure will improve the equity of the company tax instalment system relative to other taxpayers, particularly unincorporated businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most fundamental change introduced in the amendment is that for most companies there will be 4 payments to make each year rather than the existing 2 payments. Some very small companies will only be required to make one payment. For larger companies, the timing of those payments will generally be earlier than those under the existing payment  arrangements. For small companies, the new arrangements should result in lower financing costs, because on average they will result in a deferral of their tax payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised company tax instalment arrangements will apply to large companies in the 1995-96 year of income and to all other companies, a year earlier, in the 1994-95 year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to avoid an overlap with the existing company tax instalment arrangements, large companies will have transitional payment arrangements in the 1995-96 year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in this Bill will result in consequential amendments to the franking of dividends provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. These consequential amendments will follow in a later Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures introduced in this Bill will result in a bring forward of $0.6 billion of revenue into 1994-95, $1.6 billion into 1995-96 and $1.7 billion into 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the "Investing in the Nation" statement it was announced that the new company tax instalment system would contain rules to prevent small companies in large company groups taking advantage of the more generous payment arrangements for small companies. In view of the numerous methods available to consolidate the tax position of a group of companies for these purposes, it is the Government's view that there should be wide public consultation during the formulation of these rules. Accordingly, these rules have not been incorporated into this Bill and will follow, after adequate consultation, in a later Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fringe Benefits Tax&mdash;Extension of Child Care exemptions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, employers who secure priority of access in child care centres for children of employees, by making payments under a program operated by the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services, are exempt from fringe benefits tax on the benefit provided. These child care centres must be an eligible child care centre for the purposes of the Child Care Act 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will give effect to the announcement on 9 February 1993 by the Prime Minister in his "Investing in the Nation" Statement to extend this exemption to payments made for priority of access to Family Day Care, Outside School Hours Care and Vacation Care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The payments must now be made under the Children's Services Program which has replaced  the program known as Services for Families with Children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost to revenue is $0.5m in 1993-94, $1.5m in 1994-95, $2.2m in 1995-96 and $3.0m in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The taxation of Foreign Investment Funds</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains amendments that relate to the foreign investment fund measures enacted late last year. These measures sought to  remove the tax deferral advantage that could have been obtained by resident taxpayers who held interests in certain offshore companies and trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia now has a comprehensive system of taxing foreign source income. The first two parts of this system were the foreign tax credit system and the controlled foreign company measures. The third and last part of the system, the Foreign Investment Fund Measures, took effect from 1 January 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures have been kept under constant review to put right any difficulties which might arise in the course of their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review has confirmed the validity of the measures that have been put in place. However, some amendments to the law are required to fine tune the foreign investment fund measures and to align them properly with existing provisions, particularly the controlled foreign company measures. The Bill contains these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will have minimal effect on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Income tax exemption for Defence Force and Federal Police personnel serving in certain areas</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also exempt from income tax the pay and allowances of members of the Australian Defence Force allotted for duty in Somalia, and the United Nations peacekeeping force in the area formerly known as Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Australian Federal Police serving with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia will also receive an exemption from income tax of their pay and allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are expected to cost approximately $13 million and $1 million for the 1992-93 and 1993-94 income years respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment relating to migration information</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives effect to the Minister of Immigration and Ethnics Affairs' announcement on 17 December 1992 to introduce new measures aimed at detecting and locating overstayers and visitors working in Australia without authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the secrecy provisions to permit the Commissioner to furnish information to the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for the purpose of assisting in locating persons who are unlawfully in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment is not expected to impact significantly on the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to improve the readability of section 78</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gift provisions of the income tax law will be amended to improve the overall readability of the provisions. The amendments are part of the ongoing efforts to improve the tax laws while not changing the policies and principles underlying the existing legislation. These changes will have no impact on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments remove the ad hoc list of funds, authorities and institutions that have been added to the law since 1936 and replace it with a comprehensive index and a set of tables dividing the various funds into broad categories. This will help the reader to locate a particular fund far more easily than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also group together, and clarify, the valuation rules relating to gifts of property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional arrangements will ensure that those funds, authorities or institutions approved under the existing legislation will continue to hold that approval under the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will take effect on 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION (FURTHER PAYMENT) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the bill is to authorise a contribution of $350 million to the tenth replenishment of the International Development Association. The International Development Association, or "IDA", is the concessional or soft loan arm of the World Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last three decades have seen some major achievements in the developing world. Several developing countries in our region are achieving annual growth rates of between six and nine percent. The Asia Pacific region has seen both a proportional and absolute drop in the number of people living under the poverty line&mdash;and there is no clearer measure of development success than that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, despite such achievements, the magnitude of the problems confronting the developing world remains daunting. Problems such as poverty and lack of infrastructure are compounded by high levels of population growth. These issues compete for attention and scarce resources with environmental degradation, HIV/AIDS and natural disasters. And it is the poorest, especially women and children, who are the most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While average income levels have increased, there are still over three billion people who are forced to exist on incomes of less than $US2 a day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is committed to helping developing countries meet these challenges. We do so&mdash;not only because we would like to be good international citizens and because, as Australians, we have a strong sense of social justice&mdash;but because we have clear and compelling national interests in promoting and investing in the process of international development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aid program is one element of the Government's broader policy of engagement with both our immediate region and the international community. It is clearly linked to Australia's interests in expanding trade and investment. By helping to create a stable and prosperous world economy, we are building future markets for Australian goods and services. The Australian aid program offers Australians opportunities to participate in the development process through the supply of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multilateral Development Banks such as the World Bank, of which IDA is a part, and the Asian Development Bank complement Australia's own bilateral development programs, which are concentrated in the Asia-Pacific region. They also provide a means for Australia to assist countries where we do not have bilateral aid programs, and on a scale which would be impossible alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Banks also play an invaluable role in coordinating the efforts of different donors to ensure aid is used effectively. In particular the Banks' coordinating role in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia is important in ensuring our bilateral aid dollar goes further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Development Banks have also been effective in promoting economic reform including market-oriented economic policies and the removal of trade barriers in order to foster efficient development. The World Bank continues to be an ardent supporter of trade liberalisation and a strong voice in the push for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, which is vital from Australia's and many developing countries' perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Banks, particularly the World Bank, perform a catalytic role in the development debate and their research and analysis is a great asset in managing our own bilateral programs. At Australia's initiative and with our ongoing support, the World Bank now carries out extensive studies of the economies of the South Pacific in cooperation with the Asian Development Bank. This is of great use to the countries themselves and to Australia's bilateral programs in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our support of the Banks also allows Australian firms to compete as suppliers or consultants for World Bank projects. Many Australians are already actively engaged in supplying services for World Bank projects, especially in the Asia region. With the World Bank lending in the order of $A30 billion a year in over 90 developing countries, the opportunities for Australian exporters are enormous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we should all recognise the multitude of motives Australia has for promoting international development, we must not lose sight of the goal&mdash;the sustainable reduction in poverty. This means that all of our development assistance, including our contributions to the Development Banks, should serve that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the international battle against poverty, the World Bank is one of the most powerful players. It is the largest and the most global of all international development institutions, operating in all sectors and all regions. The International Development Association, to which this bill authorises a $350 million Australian contribution, is that part of the World Bank with the strongest direct focus on poverty reduction. It provides highly concessional loans for development activities in most of the world's poorest countries&mdash;those with annual per capita incomes of less than $US740. IDA loans usually involve ten year grace periods, thirty-five or forty year maturities, and no interest charges. They are also accompanied by training and technical advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's contribution to the tenth replenishment of IDA will cover development projects signed in the three financial years 1993-94 to 1995-96. IDA will, however, call upon these funds over 10 years, reflecting the time generally taken to implement projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's $A350 million contribution to IDA-10, represents a share of 1.46 per cent, a decline in real terms on our contribution to IDA-9. However, a $A350 million contribution to IDA-10 allows Australia to contribute its fair share of the replenishment whilst recognising the current economic realities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the priorities decided by donors for IDA-10 include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an increased share of IDA resources directed to the social sector and direct poverty targeted investments;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">expanded support for family planning and social services for women, including education for girls;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">stronger emphasis on environmentally sustainable development;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">greater monitoring of recipient government public expenditures to ensure they reflect development priorities and a reduction in non-development expenditures such as military expenditure; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">endorsement of IDA's plans to improve the quality of projects, including design, monitoring and supervision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality of IDA project management and the policies IDA pursues are of considerable interest to Australia. A number of criticisms have been levelled at the World Bank over the last few years, some with justification. The Australian Government has taken up these issues with World Bank management&mdash;sometimes with support from other donors, sometimes alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has consistently argued for increased attention to direct poverty alleviation, the environment, the role and needs of women in development, participation of local communities and the social dimensions of structural adjustment programs. I am pleased to report that the response from Bank management has been generally encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the policy front, the World Bank has shifted substantially in the past five years. It has articulated its strategies for reducing poverty and has increased its emphasis on environmental protection, the position of women and private-sector development. New emphasis has also been placed on projects and programs designed to improve the transparency and efficiency of the public sector and on legal and regulatory frameworks. These important directions must be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the level of the World Bank's high administrative costs the Australian Government has strongly and consistently argued for restraint and administrative economising. Australia will continue to press the Bank<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to take a constrained approach on such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The post cold war period has created new demands on the World Bank, including pressures to provide substantial assistance for economic transformation in central and eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union. The World Bank's president has repeatedly assured the international community that the Bank has the financial capacity to respond to these challenges without reducing its support to traditional borrowers and that the concessional resources of IDA will continue to be channelled to the poorest, least creditworthy countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is only through our full and active participation that Australia can make a difference to the World Bank's policies. This includes Australia contributing its fair share to the replenishment of funds, and thereby securing a commensurate say in policy discussions amongst donors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The end of the cold war holds out new promise for cooperative action to address global and regional development problems. Since the states of the former Soviet Union joined the World Bank in 1991-92, it is now, more than ever, a truly global institution. In a world characterised by increasing change and complexity, the World Bank offers countries, such as Australia, who exercise middle-level power, an important vehicle for pursuing their national interests in the international arena, as such, it deserves our support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes certain amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (commonly referred to as ATSIC) and to the structure of Regional Councils that were established under the original Act. In essence the changes provide for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. a reduction in the number of Regional Councils, from 60 to 36;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. removal of the Minister's power to choose the Chairperson of the Commission and two non-elected Commissioners; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. recognition of the very substantial workloads of Commissioners and of Regional Council Chairpersons by making them full-time appointments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When ATSIC came into being, a little over 3 years ago, it was the culmination of a long process of debate in the Parliament and of consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Here were bold and innovative proposals indeed. The central responsibility for the Commonwealth's activities for Australia's indigenous peoples was to be assumed by a Commission comprised entirely of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, most of whom were to be elected. Gone would be the days where key decisions affecting the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be taken by a Minister and his officials. To strengthen the transformation from dependence to empowerment, a structure of 60 elected Regional Councils was to be created, providing a real measure of local autonomy and choice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing like this had been tried before, in Australia or overseas. It represented a unique experiment in public administration. There were many who doubted whether it could work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their fears, I am delighted to say, have been unfounded. ATSIC has established itself as an authentic and respected national voice for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and a responsive and responsible administrator of government programs. It has been firm both in the independence of the advice it has provided and in the standards of accountability it has set for the programs it delivers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The confidence we have in the Commission has been confirmed by entrusting it with a substantial increase in its responsibilities, both through the new and augmented programs arising from the response of governments to the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and through the transfer to it of programs previously operated by other Commonwealth agencies. In 1992-93, its program budget is one-third higher than for the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsibilities of Regional Councils have been progressively increased. They now make more of the decisions about how funds are to be distributed and play an increasingly active role in the whole range of activities and policies that will affect the lives of their peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In State and Territory Governments, there is growing recognition of the role of ATSIC and of the desirability of co-ordinating their activities for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with ATSIC's structures and programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most pleasing of all, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs have now become matters enjoying a high measure of cross-party support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps more importantly, the thrust of the proposals supported on both sides of politics reflect the advice provided by the ATSIC Commissioners themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC's achievements are a tribute to the dedication of Commissioners, Regional Councillors and staff of ATSIC, who have worked hard to make this new approach a success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is against this background that the changes proposed in the Bill are being put before the Parliament. The changes are based on the Government's commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-determination and our confidence in indigenous people managing their own affairs. They are fundamentally about shifting greater decision-making power to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples themselves. They are also directly in line with the thrust of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important provision of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was that, before the end of the term of the first elected Commissioners, the Commission should review and report to the Minister on the operation of the Act. Section 26 of the Act provides that the review should deal with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. any problems that may have been caused by conflicts between the representative responsibility of Commissioners and their responsibility as members of a body with executive responsibilities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the operation of the electoral system established by the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. any other matter relating to the operation of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission completed its report and presented it to the Minister in February. In preparing its report, the Commission was assisted by a panel which included experts from other Commonwealth bodies. In accordance with sub-section 26(5), the report has been tabled in both Houses of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report is a highly important document. It provides clear testimony to the basic strength and soundness of the legislation which created ATSIC, while also showing the way to improvement in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is from that report that the changes proposed in this Bill originate. It is not practicable to deal with all the recommendations of the report in the short time available to the Parliament in the current Sittings, and the Bill deals with only those matters which are of the highest priority for reasons of timing. Additional proposals for changes to the Act will be put before the Parliament at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to stress again that none of the proposals I am putting before the Parliament today were considered by the Government without having the support of the Commissioners of ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 11 of the Commission's report dealt with "Regional Councils&mdash;numbers, functions and powers", and proposed that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the numbers of Regional Councils be reduced;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the powers of Regional Councils be increased; greater administrative support be provided to Regional Councils; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Regional Council Chairpersons be appointed on a full-time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation has a particular urgency because the Act presently requires that Regional Council elections be held before the end of this year. I am advised by the Commission that a deferment of those elections would be viewed unfavourably by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Accordingly, unless changes to the Act are made as a matter of priority, the opportunity to implement this recommendation would be lost for another 3 years. That would clearly be undesirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill proposes a reduction in the number of Regional Councils from 60 to 36. In considering the reductions to be made in the number of Regional Councils, the Commissioners of ATSIC and the Government took into account the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the desirability, where practicable, of amalgamating Councils with small Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the need to avoid merging non-urban Councils with metropolitan Councils with large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, which would lead to the prospect of city domination;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. minimising other boundary changes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. greater administrative support for Councils with most ATSIC Regional Offices now to serve a single Council; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. improved administrative efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 27 of the Act presently provides for a Commission of 20 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Of these, the Chairperson and two others are appointed by the Minister, while the others are elected by Regional Councillors to represent the 17 Zones around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission recommended that the provision for Ministerial appointments should be repealed on the basis that they are inconsistent with the principles of self-determination and empowerment which were the basis for the establishment of ATSIC. The Government accepts this view, and section 27 will be amended accordingly. The Minister will no longer have the power to choose the Chairperson and two other Commissioners, and there will be a consequential reduction in the number of Commissioners from 20 to 17. The Chairperson will now be elected by Commissioners, and will hold that office for the term of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC, in short, will become a fully elected body&mdash;a body of some 600 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Councillors deciding their own priorities, providing their own policy advice to Government. This is an achievement for Australia and for the indigenous peoples of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third major aspect of the Bill is to allow for the appointment of Commissioners and Regional Council Chairpersons on a full-time basis. At present, only the Commission Chairperson is a full-time appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change to full-time appointments, as recommended in the review report, recognises that responsibilities of Commissioners and Regional Council Chairpersons have proved to be far greater than was foreseen when ATSIC was created. Increasingly they are finding that the demands of their positions are such as to make it difficult for them to sustain outside employment. This reflects how rapidly ATSIC and the Regional Councils have come to be accepted as the central organs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, and the increased responsibilities that have flowed from such factors as the response of Governments to the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remind honourable Senators that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, in its 1992 report "Mainly Urban", unanimously recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission should receive a salary, to be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal, which reflects the full-time nature of the position and recognises the responsibilities devolved to Commissioners" (Recommendation 66).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present workloads of Regional Council Chairpersons will increase considerably as a result of the reduction in the number of Councils, and of the progressive transfer to Regional Councils of additional responsibilities, as envisaged in the recommendations of the review report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next two months ATSIC is organising a series of workshops of Commissioners and Regional Council Chairpersons to discuss implementation of the changes that are included in this Bill, and also the various other reforms proposed in the Commission's report. One important matter to be discussed in these consultations will be the option of introducing, if possible for the 1993 elections, a ward system for Regional Council elections. Such a system would provide an assured level of representation for each significant area of a region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to stress that a crucial element of the strategy of the Commissioners which is supported by the Government is the devolution of greater decision making powers and responsibilities to the Regional Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the major provisions of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 2 provides for the provisions of the Bill to come into effect on Royal Assent, except for the new section 30 relating to the full-time appointment of Commissioners which would come into effect on a date to be proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 5 amends section 27 of the Act to provide for a Commission of 17 elected Commissioners, and for the election by Commissioners of a Chairperson from among their number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6 repeals section 28, which deals with the constitution of the first Commission of 5 appointed Commissioners which operated for the first year of ATSIC's existence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 7 replaces the existing section 30 so as to provide for the full-time appointment of Commissioners. It includes a provision which enables existing Commissioners to elect to continue to hold office on a part-time basis until the next Zone elections. This is to protect the interests of any Commissioners who do not wish to put at risk their present tenure of other employment in addition to their part-time role as Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 8 provides for the election by Commissioners of a Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson. These arrangements will come into effect when a new Commission is elected in early 1994. Clause 9 defines the periods of appointment of the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 14 amends section 91 of the Act to provide for the reduction in the number of Regional Councils from 60 to 36. A change is also made to provide for a more effective process for public notification of the boundaries of Regional Councils. Sub-section 91(3) of the Act is repealed; this sub-section prevents changes being made to Regional Council boundaries after 31 March in an election year and is therefore inconsistent with the intent of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 15 and 19 exempt the Chairperson of the Commission from requirements for Regional Councillors to spend at least some time living in their regions. This is to avoid the possibility of compromise to the Chairperson's position should he or she find it necessary to establish full-time residence in Canberra but is unable also to maintain a residence in their home region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 17 reduces the period between the notice by a Minister for a polling day or days for Regional Council elections from 90 days for 60 days, in respect of the 1993 elections only. This is to provide adequate time for implementation of necessary changes to the arrangements for the elections flowing from the amendments to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 18 omits sub-section 113(9) of the Act, so as to allow for election rules for Regional Council elections to come into effect from date of gazettal. Such an amendment is necessary if there is to be any prospect of introducing a ward system for Regional Council elections in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 20 and 21 deal with Regional Council Chairpersons, including their election for the full term of a Council and for their appointment on a full-time basis. Provisions are made, on a basis similar to those applying for Commissioners, for resignation, termination of appointment, and leave. It is also provided that one person cannot hold the offices of Commissioner and Regional Council Chairperson at the one time&mdash;something that is possible at present while they are both part-time positions. The remuneration of Regional Council Chairpersons will be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. These changes will come into effect following the next elections for Regional Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 24 amends Schedule 1 to the Act. This Schedule provides the basis for the division of Australia into Zones and Regions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 25 provides for transitional arrangements for the existing 60 Regional Councils, which will of course continue to exist until the declaration of the polls for the elections to be held later this year for the 36 new Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other provisions of the Bill are essentially for machinery and consequential changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum. I also present, for the information of honourable Senators, maps setting out the changes to be made to Regional Council and Zone boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that the proposals I put before you today&mdash;proposals which are those put to me by ATSIC Commissioners&mdash;will have the support of members on all sides of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">This Bill reflects the commitment of this Government to ensuring that traditional Aboriginal owners will be able to enjoy security of title over their traditional lands to the fullest extent practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in Schedule 1 of the Act may be granted to Aboriginal Land Trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the Act came into operation in 1977 a total of 54 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill would schedule a further 3 areas of traditional land under the Act known as "Catfish Dreaming", "Eva Valley Station" and "Kanturrpa&mdash;Kanttaji".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheduling of the areas known as Catfish Dreaming and Eva Valley arises from an agreement (facilitated by the Commonwealth Government) between an Association of Aboriginal traditional owners known as the Jawoyn Association, the Northern Territory Government and the mining company Zapopan NL. Under this agreement Zapopan will be allowed to proceed with the important gold mining venture at Mount Todd. The Jawoyn Association has agreed not to pursue any claim for native title or support any such claim by any other person in respect of the mineral leases involved and has also agreed to give Zapopan unrestricted rights of access to the land whilst undertaking to support ongoing exploration activity by the company. Zapopan has also agreed to provide employment and training for Aboriginal people at the mining site. As part of this settlement the Commonwealth Government has agreed to amend the Act to schedule two parcels of land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the scheduling of the third area known as Kanturrpa&mdash;Kanttaji arises from a settlement reached between the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority and the Central Land Council, representing the claimants in the Kanturrpa&mdash;Kanttaji Land Claim. Essentially that settlement  secures for the Northern Territory the current and future water supply for Tennant Creek, in return for its support for the scheduling of the land. This is to be achieved by the granting of a licence allowing the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority the right to continue its borefield operations in the Tennant Creek area and by the granting of a lease to secure access to present and future borefields on that and adjacent Aboriginal land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no financial  implications arising from this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill represents an application of the statutory basis for granting land to traditional Aboriginal owners in the Northern Territory. Honourable senators will be aware of the Mabo case, in which the High Court of Australia has affirmed that the common law itself recognises native title in certain circumstances. The Government is in the process of developing a comprehensive response to the Mabo decision in the interests of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's greatest natural assets and was one of Australia's first world heritage areas. Successive Commonwealth and Queensland governments have worked together to support the protection and wise use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park through the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reef is critically important to Australian industries such as tourism and fishing. It supports a domestic and international tourism industry that contributes more than $1,000 million to our economy each year and a commercial fishing industry that contributes $300 million a year&mdash;both employ thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and Queensland governments have invested significant resources in managing the reef and industry has invested heavily in developments that rely for their sustainability on the integrity of the reef ecosystem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the last five years, use of the marine park, especially for tourism, has been increasing at about 10 per cent per year. In spite of the recession, the government has increased its appropriation for management of the park by an average of 2.9 per cent per year in real terms. Despite this increase, the funds available for environmental management of the Great Barrier Reef have not kept pace with the increasing level of use of the marine park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Great Barrier Reef marine park is a model for ecologically sustainable use of marine resources which has captured the interest of marine resource managers throughout the world. It is a model which has very successfully combined a wide variety of economic activities with the conservation of the unique natural and cultural resources that attract economic activities to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing pressures caused by tourism, infrastructure development, mariculture, and human settlement are beginning to affect the reef. We need to find a way to make more resources available for management at a level guaranteed to match the increasing use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to provide for the collection of charges imposed by the Great Barrier Reef (Environmental Management Charge&mdash;General) Bill 1993 and the Great Barrier Reef (Environmental Management Charge&mdash;Excise) Bill 1993. The introduction of environmental management charges on commercial users will help offset increasing demands placed on management of the marine park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Keating Government is committed to the underlying principle of this Bill&mdash;that a commercial operator using a community asset for profit should contribute to the cost of its management and conservation. We have applied the user pays principle in Commonwealth managed fisheries since the mid-1980's, and we intend to apply the same concept to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Since commercial operators using the marine park are dependent on the reef as their principal resource it is fair that they contribute financially to the management of this priceless resource and the research necessary to ensure its survival.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under present arrangements, commercial activities including tourist operations, infrastructure construction, and mariculture require permits from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1988, the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council, on which the Commonwealth and Queensland governments are represented, approved a study of the feasibility of an environmental management charge scheme. Extensive consultations have been conducted with the commercial operators who have held permits to operate in the marine park since that time. Operators have acknowledged that management of the marine park, including relevant research, is essential to the continued viability of their industries. The proposed charges are in accordance with views of most of the operators affected by the Bill. Details of the charging scheme will be dealt with by regulations. Following representation by operators, I have agreed to exempt all direct transfers between parts of Queensland such as between Queensland islands and the mainland, when operators are merely transiting the marine park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant advantage for the industry in this scheme is that transferability of permits under specified conditions will be possible, enabling improved flexibility in commercial decision making. The charges on commercial tourism operators included in the regulations that I intend to submit to the executive council for approval are equivalent to only about $1 per person per day for most tourist operations&mdash;this is less than one per cent of the price of a ticket for a day trip to the outer Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation package imposes charges on those commercial operations in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park which presently need a permit from the authority. Activities which do not currently require a permit&mdash;for example, private recreational activities like boating and general access to beach and reef areas&mdash;will not be subject to environmental management charges. Commercial fishermen other than those engaged in aquaculture will not be subject to the charges. They do not require permits from the authority and already pay substantial charges to fisheries management agencies for managing that resource.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 is being introduced with two separate Environmental Management Charge Bills to comply with section 55 of the constitution relating to tax legislation. The details for implementation of the charges, such as fixing of the amount to be charged, and specifying the activities to be covered by the charges, will be determined by regulations under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, which are subject to tabling in both houses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide an opportunity for the continuing participation of groups that will be affected by the charges, this Bill extends the function of the Great Barrier Reef consultative committee to include the provision of advice to the minister in respect of the charging scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue collected through the imposition of the charges will be used by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for research, education and other aspects of environmental management. It will enhance the knowledge base and community understanding of the reef and contribute directly and indirectly towards better management and environmental protection both by the authority and by day to day users. Commercial operators will benefit by ensuring the continued conservation of the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;the resource on which their activities depend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that the introduction of charges will raise approximately $1 million per year at the present levels of commercial use. If the Bill is enacted during these sittings, the charges will be introduced on the first of July this year. The cost of collecting the charges, which will be drawn from revenue raised, will be about 10 per cent of the amount collected. The Government will continue to fund the great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority through budget appropriations, in line with present practice. The environmental management charges will contribute to offsetting the additional costs of the increasing commercial use of the marine park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successive Commonwealth governments have enjoyed bipartisan support for their initiatives in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park&mdash;from the time the legislation was introduced by the Whitlam Labor Government, through the implementation and declaration of the marine park by the Fraser coalition Government, to the completion of the zoning plans by the Hawke Labor Government. I hope that this bipartisan support for securing the management of this precious resource will continue with the passage of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, this bill gives effect to the Government's resolve to improve the management and protection of one of the world's greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the senate, and present the explanatory memorandum which covers the three Bills I am introducing in this package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Employment, Education and Training Act 1988 requires a review of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET) and related bodies within five years of the commencement of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The five year period ends on 30 June 1993. As a consequence the Minister gave consideration in the latter part of 1992 to the terms of reference for the review and the selection of a person to undertake it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, at that time it was clear an election was pending and that the policy statements of the Coalition and the Government saw very different futures for NBEET. The Coalition undertaking to abolish NBEET was of particular significance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against that background, the Minister decided that the review should be deferred so that the in-coming government could determine the terms of reference in a way that would make the review forward looking rather than simply retrospective.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes some minor amendments to the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 in relation to staffing of the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Training Authority was established formally in December 1992 following an agreement between Heads of Government in July of that year. The Authority is developing its organisational structure and engaging staff progressively during 1993, leading to full implementation of the new National Vocational Education and Training System from the beginning of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a truly national body, the Authority should be able to draw its staff from a wide range of sources in both the public and private sectors, during its establishment period and on an ongoing basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing provisions of the Act already provide a good deal of flexibility in staffing arrangements. However, it now appears that the existing provisions are not sufficiently flexible in two small, but important respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first relates to the Authority's Chief Executive Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Authority has recently conducted an exhaustive public recruitment campaign for its first Chief Executive Officer. During this process, it became apparent that a capacity for the Authority to arrange for secondment of a Chief Executive Officer would enhance its ability to engage suitable people from the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently provides for the Authority to appoint a Chief Executive Officer but makes no mention of appointment by way of secondment, although there is provision for secondment of other staff. I am advised that, without an explicit provision, the Authority would not be able to second a Chief Executive Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this basis the Authority asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, in his capacity as Chairperson of the Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council to which the Authority reports, to seek the Council's agreement to introduction of an amendment to the Act to make such an explicit provision. The Council agreed to this proposal at its meeting on 23 April and also endorsed the Authority's selection of a senior Victorian public servant, Mr Terry Moran, to be its inaugural Chief Executive Officer. The Authority proposes to second Mr Moran using the new provisions should they be enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3 of the Bill would make explicit provision to permit the Authority to appoint a Chief Executive Officer by way of  a secondment from the Commonwealth, a State or Territory or from an authority of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is common practice for a person to retain similar salary and other entitlements as apply to his or her `home' position while on secondment. For this reason, the Bill provides that a seconded Chief Executive Officer would not be subject to the provisions of the Act dealing with the setting of remuneration and other matters by the Remuneration Tribunal or the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of this provision would depend on the terms of an individual secondment arrangement. The cost to the Authority, and therefore to the Commonwealth which provides the Authority's operating funds, could be higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply. Any additional cost would be expected to be only a very small component of the Authority's total operating budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act already provides that the Authority would have to consult with the Ministerial Council before appointing a Chief Executive Officer. This would also apply in relation to a person who the authority proposed to appoint by way of secondment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A secondment from the Australian Public Service or a Commonwealth authority would be under the usual arrangements for secondments to a Commonwealth statutory authority. The amendment also provides specifically that the Authority would have to consult the Ministerial Council on any proposed arrangement for the secondment of its Chief Executive Officer from a non-Commonwealth body. The Council could, if it wished, lay down guidelines for such arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the second aspect of the amendments which deals with a possible limitation in the existing provisions of the Act for secondment of staff other than the Chief Executive Officer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is some doubt whether those provisions, as currently worded, would enable the Authority to make secondment arrangements with State and Territory authorities including, for example statutory authorities with responsibilities in vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 of the Bill would remove any such doubt by providing explicitly for these secondments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments which I have outlined will assist the Australian National Training Authority to proceed with its important job of working with all governments to create an effective national vocational education and training system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable Senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) is not present to hear the debate on this Bill&mdash;I can understand that he probably thought another Bill was coming on first. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 [1993] seeks to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill contains two major proposed amendments. The first is designed to introduce more stringent accountability requirements for the commercial activities of the ABC. The coalition believes that these amendments should be welcomed as they reduce the prospect of risk to the taxpayer. However, the second major proposed amendment regarding the ABC's access to transmitters is of considerable concern to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Act states that the Minister for Communications shall hand over all transmitters free of charge to the ABC. These transmitters are currently owned by the Commonwealth but are made available to the ABC through the newly created government agency, the National Transmission Agency. Prior to the creation of the NTA, the department itself owned and operated the transmitters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For reasons perhaps best known to the Minister and his department, despite the clear statement in the ABC Act 1983, none of the approximately 1,000 radio and television transmitters has ever been transferred to the ABC. Therefore, the ABC relies on a third party, another government agency, for access to the one service it cannot do without&mdash;its transmission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ownership and control of transmitters is not an incidental point. It would be like Telecom without phones or the air force without planes. To say that the ABC is nothing without access to transmitters is not an exaggeration. The transmitters are absolutely vital&mdash;without them there would be no ABC television and no ABC radio. The ABC could spend billions of dollars a year on making programs, but without the ability to transmit them it would be a wasted effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the public do not understand that the ABC does not control its own transmissions. When ABC radio goes off the air or snow appears on people's TV screen when they are watching the news, they do not ring up the Department of Transport and Communications or the NTA; they ring up the ABC. Outside cities people ring their local ABC regional radio station to complain about TV&mdash;not that ABC radio staff know the first thing about TV reception. Why should they? I am sure that those staff do a sterling job trying to explain that it is not the ABC's fault, but I am also sure that many people think they are being fobbed off. After all, who would be responsible for the transmission of ABC programs if not the ABC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the ABC owned and ran its own transmitters as envisaged by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, then many problems that the ABC currently experiences could be overcome. Firstly, the ABC could balance its total resources. If the ABC could make savings in the area of transmissions, which it believes it could, that money could be used elsewhere. Secondly, following a government decision to extend Triple J, for instance, to 42 regional areas across Australia, as was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during the election campaign, the ABC itself could decide the timetable, rather than waiting for the NTA which might have different priorities. Thirdly, the ABC would be entirely responsible for the transmission of its own programs and, if a problem occurred with transmission, the ABC itself would be able to fix the problem, or at least relay directly to its audience just what the problem is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result would no doubt be fewer problems fixed more quickly. Honourable senators might ask why, and the answer really is that ABC managers and employees, in taking pride in their work and dealing directly with the public, would have the incentive to make sure the ABC was off air as little as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the Government would have agreed to such a concept&mdash;that increased productivity comes from employees who have a sense of purpose, who are linked to their end product and who care about their service level and reputation. That is why the commercial stations own their own transmitters and why major overseas public broadcasters, like the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the BBC, own their own transmitters. I do not wish to imply for one second that the staff of the NTA are not highly qualified and that their technical expertise is not appreciated, but that is not the point. If the ABC is off the air, it is the ABC's reputation that is on the line, not the NTA's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, transferring ownership of transmitters to the ABC could put an end to what I believe is a regular occurrence at Senate estimates committee hearings where senators regularly ask ABC representatives why this network or that network has been delayed, why there is not Triple J in certain areas or why people living in another place have such bad reception for ABC television. But the ABC cannot answer these questions simply because transmission is not its responsibility. The existing arrangement has long been held to be unsatisfactory. For all the reasons I have outlined, the 1983 ABC Act, in section 75 paragraph (3), provided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister shall cause all transmitters that are provided by the Commonwealth for use in connection with the performance of the functions of the Corporation to be transferred, without charge to the Corporation, to the ownership of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>However, clauses 12 and 13 of this Bill that is now before us seek to repeal the whole of part VII of the Act, which includes the section regarding transferring ownership of the transmitters to the ABC. In its place, this would be substituted by paragraph 76 and 77. The coalition is particularly concerned about paragraphs (1) and (3) of section 76. The amendments contained in clauses 12 and 13 of the Bill result from the decision last year by the Government to establish the National Transmission Agency to manage the Government's multipurpose transmission facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister, in his second reading speech, stated that in view of the establishment of the NTA, the Act would be amended to remove the provision for the Minister to transfer technical equipment and land relating to the transmitting stations used for the purpose of broadcasting ABC programs to the public. As a consequence, paragraph (1) of the new section 76 provides only that the Minister may arrange for the provision and operation of transmission facilities for the purposes of broadcasting programs of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an amendment to the Act which provides that the Minister may transfer ownership of the transmitters without charge; it is not even an amendment which provides the Minister may transfer ownership at all. The amendment would give the Minister the power to decide whether the ABC may have access to transmission facilities. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister may arrange for the provision and operation of the transmission facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that if this amendment went through the Minister would suddenly decide that he may not arrange for the ABC to have access to the transmitters, but that is not the point. If this amendment were to go through, a future Minister could decide not to give the ABC access to transmitters. The coalition does not believe that a Government Minister should have that power, a power which potentially threatens the independence of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The ABC should not operate in the knowledge or under any threat that its access to transmitters which it does not own is at the discretion of the Minister of the day. Paragraph (3) of section 76 of the amendment Bill provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Minister so arranges under this section, he or she may stipulate what charges, if any, are to be paid by the Corporation in respect of the provision and operation of those facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the Minister's second reading speech, a review will be held later this year in which it will be decided whether the National Transmission Agency will become a government business enterprise, in which case the NTA would operate as a separate cost centre and the Minister would be able to direct that the ABC be charged for the use of its transmission facilities. In the event of the ABC being required to pay, it would be provided with an additional appropriation. This would result in a greater transparency in the system, but again there are implications arising from this which could impact on the independence of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC is the NTA's major client. In fact, it forms 85 per cent of the NTA's client base. If the NTA did become a government business enterprise, what sort of pressure would it be under to seek additional clients from the private sector? Could this impinge on its responsibilities to our national broadcaster? Would the NTA make decisions in favour of private sector clients over the ABC? I am not suggesting that this will happen, but there are serious questions that need to be addressed when the matter is discussed later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that it is desirable that the ABC's transmission facilities be placed on a commercial footing, but clauses 12 and 13 of this Bill before us unnecessarily threaten the ABC's guaranteed access to transmission facilities. Therefore, these clauses should be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC, like commercial radio and television stations across Australia, should own its own transmitters, not only because it makes good business sense to reduce bureaucracy and not to create it, but also because it is commonsense that transmitting is an integral part of the ABC's product. Moreover, we must protect the independence of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister of the day, whoever he or she may be, should not have the power to decide whether he or she may provide the ABC with access to transmitters. The ABC must be able to work with any government and any Minister without fear or favour. For all of these reasons, the coalition will be seeking to omit clauses 12 and 13 of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 [1993]. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 [1993] does not present any real difficulties, except, as Senator Ferguson has said, in relation to the insertion of clause 12 and clause 13, regarding transmitters, and the amendment of section 25 of the Act, which allows the ABC to provide its own transmitters, including the purchase of satellite transponders and earth stations. The Australian Democrats are happy to support the amendments to section 25, which will expedite the involvement of the ABC in pay TV, if we ever come to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The insertion of clauses 12 and clause 13, however, is not something we are prepared to support. Under the present legislation, the Minister has an obligation to give control of transmitters to the ABC at some stage and at no charge. The Government has not hitherto acted to fulfil this obligation. The claim that it is imperative to remove this obligation now, because it is immediately required to act, seems a little spurious, especially at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government also claims that the purpose of these amendments is to prevent the pre-emption of the National Transmission Agency's 18-month review. Its proposed amendments do pre-empt the review by allowing the Government to renege on its legislated promise to the ABC and to hand the transmitters over to the NTA. These amendments pre-empt any recommendations that the review might make by effectively ensuring that the NTA will be formally enshrined as an autonomous government business enterprise with the possession of the transmitters. The ABC, the SBS and others would then be forced to seek commercial contracts for transmitter use, with no firm commitment from the Government to provide them with extra funding to meet those additional costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that, if the Government was seriously trying to avoid pre-empting the NTA review, the Senate would not be wasting its time on any amendments pertaining to transmitters until that review is tabled later this year. In any case, it is almost certain that the Parliament will be faced with further amendments after the review. The appropriate time to deal with consequential changes to the ABC Act, if they are required, would be after that review, not now. The Democrats will therefore not be supporting clauses 12 and 13, but will be supporting Senator Ferguson's very sensible amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking on behalf of the Government, I am pleased to note that, apart from a couple of clauses that relate to one issue, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 [1993] is being accepted by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. I would like to make a couple of points about the issues raised by Senator Ferguson and Senator Bourne. First of all, I can count as well as anybody, and the Democrats and the Opposition combined have the numbers to carry the amendment. I want to put on the record the Government's view about the issues they raised with regard to the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In 1991, after a review process involving extensive consultation with all stakeholders, the Government decided to establish the National Transmission Agency, NTA, as a separate body to provide, operate and maintain the Commonwealth's network of transmission facilities. The Government decided that this was the best means of ensuring the effective delivery of all national broadcasting services, not only ABC services but also SBS television and radio services and parliamentary broadcasting services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The NTA was established under an administrative arrangement as a separate cost centre within the Department of Transport and Communications to operate on a more commercial basis, using accrual accounting to fully disclose the costs of operation of the transmission network, with commercially oriented performance targets under a resource agreement negotiated with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis)&mdash;I must say that it is no mean feat to achieve that outcome with the ministry of finance&mdash;and with obligations to tender work for the transmission system to a number of service providers, not just Telecom as in the past. These arrangements were established on an interim basis for 18 months and were designed to achieve greater economy and efficiency of service delivery, together with better information on costs of operating the transmission system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the trial period the Government will review whether the NTA should be converted to a government business enterprise. The ABC amendment Bill before us would amend the Broadcasting Act 1983 to remove the obligation for the Minister to transfer to the ABC transmitters used for the purpose of broadcasting ABC programs to the public, which is an important element of the Commonwealth's transmission facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we want to amend the Act now?  The existing provision is inconsistent with current Government policy and longstanding administrative arrangements. This anomaly was noted in Auditor-General's report No. 22 of 1989-90 on national broadcasting transmission facilities which recommended that arrangements for the ownership of, and the funding of costs associated with, the ABC and SBS transmission facilities be clarified and that future arrangements be consistent with all the relevant legislative provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government subsequently considered the arrangements and agreed to establish the NTA and to amend the legislation to align with its policy and actual practice. I would emphasise that the amendment does not pre-empt any future decision about ownership of the transmitters. Under the terms of the amendment the transmitters could continue to be operated by the NTA or, alternatively, the national broadcasters could be funded to arrange their own transmitting facilities. The Bill specifically enables the ABC to own and operate transmission facilities if the Government provides it with funds for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To remain with the current legislative provisions would be inconsistent with arrangements approved by Parliament in 1991 for the SBS in the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991. The SBS has not made any criticisms of these arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transfer of transmitters to the ABC in isolation from other transmission facilities would result in a split responsibility for transmission infrastructure. To transfer all transmission facilities to the ABC would not take account of the reality that these facilities are also used for the broadcast of SBS and the parliamentary service, as well as commercial and community broadcasters and radio communications operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, will the NTA review consider transfer of ownership to the ABC? Senator Ferguson and Senator Bourne specifically raised this issue in their remarks. The Government has decided that, within 18 months after the set-up of the National Transmission Agency, the situation should be reviewed to establish whether the National Transmission Agency should become a government business enterprise. The review will also consider whether funds should be transferred to the ABC and SBS to pay for transmission services. If the Government concludes that it is not appropriate to establish the NTA as a GBE, it will consider alternative arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the background for the Government's view about the transmission facilities with the NTA. I think it is quite a reasonable proposal. It certainly does not close off the option, which I know the ABC management has been concerned about, of the facilities being transferred to the ABC. I must point out to the Senate that the facilities are not used purely for the ABC; those facilities are also used for the SBS and other bits and pieces. In the end I do not think that some of those other users would automatically welcome having the ABC run their transmission facilities. We would then be back here arguing whether there should be further amendments to split those transmission facilities off to the SBS or to the other users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, I do not think the Senate should be greatly concerned that there is a hidden agenda. Maybe the criticism could be that for a long time it has been in the Act that the facilities would be transferred to the ABC. Those opposite may say that the Government has hastened very slowly to reach that outcome. I know that is the view of ABC management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate to consider that the Government is very open about this process and that there is no hidden agenda. My personal view&mdash;and I have had some interest in broadcasting matters for a long time&mdash;is that there is a good case for the ABC to have control of its own transmission facilities and the same principle to apply to SBS. Each should take responsibility for those facilities. It is not a one way street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an organisation is running the transmission facilities then it will need to manage them efficiently. It cannot whinge and whine and if something goes wrong somebody will bail it out. It could be argued that the ABC and the SBS in running their own transmission facilities need the discipline to run those facilities and if they get it wrong they have to take the consequences. I understand that argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the review which is under way at the moment and will continue for another 18 months will not unduly cripple the ABC, the SBS or the other operators. I think it will give us an opportunity to make a more considered decision. I put that view in closing the debate on the second reading, and I ask the Senate to consider the view that the Government has no hidden agenda and it is not an unreasonable proposition that we are putting. </PARA>

As I said earlier, we do not expect for one minute that the Minister will not make those transmission facilities available, but the provision is there and there is no obligation on the Minister to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address two important Bills before the Senate&mdash;the National Health Amendment Bill 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 1993. My colleague Senator Patterson will be speaking at some length on the National Health Amendment Bill, which the coalition will not be opposing. I should point out that it is largely due to the work of Senator Patterson and Senator Walters that this Bill appears before us today. On behalf of the coalition, they have been pursuing the Government on the issue of the retention, retrieval and destruction of personalised information held by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services and the Health Insurance Commission since 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Patterson discovered, the Government had no policy on this issue. While the Health Insurance Commission does now have a policy of deleting files after a period of five years, it is still not being applied in practice. It seems that this policy will finally be put into practical effect in July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In amendments to the National Health Act in June 1991, the Privacy Commissioner was required to provide guidelines for the conduct of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs. Guidelines had been prepared prior to the Government being forced to drop its plans for a new computer link between the Health Insurance Commission and pharmacists to check on eligibility for pharmaceutical benefits. Following this backdown, new draft guidelines were prepared in February 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, rather than presenting these guidelines to Parliament, the Privacy Commissioner made a report to Parliament indicating that he had decided not to issue guidelines by 1 April 1992 as required. The concern of the Privacy Commissioner, based largely on the advice of the Office of General Counsel, was that the guidelines would not be valid under the provisions of the Act. In particular, the Privacy Commissioner suggested that if his guidelines were to be tabled, the Parliament ought to clarify its intention with respect to three issues: firstly, the limited re-identification of claims information after five years; secondly, that the guidelines should apply only to patient claims information; and thirdly, that the guidelines apply to claims information collected before their introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, this Bill amends the National Health Act so that Parliament's intentions are clear on each of these three issues, thus allowing the Privacy Commissioner to issue his guidelines. As I said earlier, the coalition is not opposing the Bill. Senator Patterson will be addressing the Bill in greater detail in her speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to turn now from a Bill that sets out to strengthen privacy provisions to one that represents a potentially important step in the violation of the privacy of a great many Australians. I refer to the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 1993. The Bill itself would seem quite straightforward. It is seeking to extend the charter of the Health Insurance Commission so that it is able to plan, establish and administer the Government's proposed child-care cash rebate scheme. However, as with many proposals this Government puts forward, it is not nearly so straightforward as it may seem at first. While the Bill leaves it entirely open as to what administrative system the Health Insurance Commission may develop, the decision has already been made. The Government, yet again, wants to extend the use of the tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's intention is that child carers provide their tax file number to the Health Insurance Commission, which would then pass it on to the Tax Office for checking purposes. Not only does this violate past assurances of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the extent to which the tax file number would be used in Government activities but it also violates a specific assurance made by the Government during the election campaign. In other words, the Government has once again been playing fast and loose with the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Government launched its child-care policy during the recent election campaign, briefings were provided to selected child-care organisations. The Minister's office also provided advice to the Australian Privacy Foundation. Why, one might ask, would the privacy foundation be seeking advice on the Government's child-care policy? The answer is that the privacy foundation had heard reports that the Government was flagging the use of a tax file number in the administration of its proposed child-care rebate scheme. Not surprisingly the foundation was alarmed at such a prospect and sought clarification from the Minister's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After initially being told that a tax file number would be used, at the end of the day the foundation was provided with a clear assurance by then Minister Staples's private staff that a tax file number would not have to be provided to the Health Insurance Commission. This assurance, as I say, was provided by an adviser to Minister Staples, speaking on behalf of Minister Staples. But only two months later Senator Crowley has told the Senate that as part of the new scheme it is the Government's wish that a tax file number be provided to the Health Insurance Commission. Clearly, there has been a deceptive and highly misleading campaign run by the Government during the election on the proposed use of the tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vice-Chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation has appeared on national radio on this matter and has written a letter to Senator Crowley outlining his anger at being lied to by Minister Staples's office. This is what the vice-chairman has told Senator Crowley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to draw to your attention that Mr Gration, who was at the time explicitly speaking as Mr Staples' representative, stated unequivocally to me on Friday 26 February that the rumour that the HIC would acquire the TFN  was entirely unfounded, and that the HIC would not gain the TFN. I stressed to him that I was writing his words down, in order to quote them in my interviews with the media, and read them back to him.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Senate on 6 May Senator Crowley said that to the best of her understanding false assurances had not been made by the Government on the use of the tax file number, but nonetheless undertook to check to see whether it was the case. It is now nearly two weeks since that commitment was made and Senator Crowley has yet to report back to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That false assurances were made is, as I have demonstrated, pretty clear. While there can be no confusion on this point, there has been some confusion on the part of the Minister and her department about exactly what decisions have been taken. For example, at an Estimates Committee C hearing last week the First Assistant Secretary to the Family and Children's Services Division, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision has not actually been taken that it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the child-care rebate scheme&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be linked with the tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, at the same committee meeting, Senator Crowley said that it was the Government's policy that `people would provide their tax file numbers to the Medicare office'. Despite the obfuscation of the department, it is clear that the Government has made up its mind that it wants to further extend the use of the tax file number. I believe this is a stunning and an outrageous decision. The Government has made a number of assurances regarding the use of the tax file number. For example, on 25 May 1988 the Prime Minister, then Treasurer, said that the only purpose of the tax file number:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will be to make it easier for the Tax Office to match information it receives about money earned and interest payments.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 September 1988, Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No other government or non-government agency will have access to the Tax Office file number registration system, nor will it be able to use an individual's tax file number for any registration system of its own.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have already recounted, assurances were forthcoming from the Government during the election campaign that the tax file number would not be linked to the child-care rebate scheme. Of course, the tax file number is now being used by many government agencies for matching and eligibility checking purposes: for instance, by DSS and DVA to detect duplicate payments; by DVA for superannuation fund information; by DSS and the Department of Finance; by DSS and the Health Insurance Commission; by ATO and the Australian Customs Service; by DSS and the Australian Electoral Commission; by DSS and the Child Support Agency; and by DEET and the department of immigration. There are more examples. The list goes on and on, and it is growing all the time. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that Senator Crowley had no doubt that the use of the tax file number would become widespread. In April 1987, showing remarkable prescience, Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax file number differs not much at all from the Australia Card . . . it would be aiming to do exactly the sorts of things that the Australia Card will do.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an acknowledgment. Senator Crowley in 1993 is out to prove the wisdom of her words in 1987. To propose an extension of the tax file number in the way that she has is to propose a de facto Australia Card. When asked on national radio what the danger was with the latest proposal, Roger Clarke, the Vice-Chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The danger is that the Government is the possessor of a vast amount of information about individuals, that currently that information is kept by a large number of different government agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of those government agencies identifies members of the public using different identification mechanisms. As soon as all of those agencies or even all of the principal agencies use the same identifier, it's possible to have what we call technically a virtual single data base&mdash;a single national data base which may run on different machines, but which can be combined at any time that the Government wants it to be combined.</PARA>
<PARA>When asked whether this represented a de facto Australia Card, Mr Clarke responded, `It's exactly a de facto Australia Card'. This latest proposal is unprecedented in two important respects. For the first time, service providers, as opposed to benefit recipients, will be required to provide their tax file number. The Government is attempting to cross yet another bridge in its assault on the privacy of Australians. If child-care providers are required to provide a tax file number, how long will it be before doctors and pharmacists and other service providers are required to do the same?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second way in which this latest proposal is unprecedented is that it allows the Health Insurance Commission access to both Medicare claims information and tax information. For Senator Crowley to be advocating this position is remarkable. It illustrates the extent to which members of this Government are prepared to compromise themselves. Back in September 1987 when defending the Australia Card, Senator Crowley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare information will remain separate and secure. . . Tax information will stay with the tax office. . . Medicare information will stay with Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, she was specifically recognising the importance of keeping Medicare information and tax information separate. Yet now, in an astonishing reversal of this position, Senator Crowley is arguing for the Health Insurance Commission to have access to both Medicare and tax information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the Minister to explain just how it is that she can reverse her position on the integrity of personal information and retain any credibility at all. I challenge her to set out clearly why it is that the Government has chosen a policy for the administration of its child-care rebate scheme which advocates an extension of the use of the tax file number. What other options has the Government considered and why have they been judged to be less preferable to an extension of the tax file number?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I direct the Minister to page five of the coalition's child-care policy for the details of a simple and effective means of checking the eligibility of those seeking rebates for care provided by a legitimate care provider. I ask the Minister: what consideration was given to the coalition's proposal and why was it not taken up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Privacy Foundation has endorsed the coalition's proposed system as a sensible one which gets around the problems raised by the use of a tax file number. Why was it not chosen? One can only say that, given the Government's track record, it is clear that the tax file number option has been chosen over other better options in order to further the Government's real agenda to develop an Australia Card by the back door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget: the Australia Card was overwhelmingly rejected by this Parliament and by the people of Australia. The Australia Card was rejected because it represented an encroachment upon the rights and freedoms of all Australians. It was judged by the people of Australia whom we are here to represent to be a threat to individual privacy and civil liberties. It represented something contrary to everything that this country has represented and stood for. Back in 1987 when the Australia Card was in its death throes, Senator Puplick on behalf of the coalition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will vigorously oppose any attempt to turn the tax file number system into a de facto Australia Card.</PARA>
<PARA>I put the Minister and this Government on notice that we will not stand by and see that happen. In the planning that is about to take place as a result of this legislation, the Opposition's position will need to be taken into account because the child-care legislation amendments will come before us as a result of that planning in the Budget sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition's position should not be ignored because, although we are prepared to allow the Health Insurance Commission to expand its role to plan for the introduction of the Government's promised child-care rebate scheme, we are not prepared to support the extension of the tax file number system in the way that is being detailed to us at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In detailing the Government's duplicitous and capricious extensions to the tax file number and its plans to catch child carers in its big brother network, I have not yet commented on the deficiencies inherent in the Government's child-care policy. When it was released in February, the Government's policy was widely and accurately perceived as being a child-care policy for millionaires. Under the government rebate scheme as promised, no means test is to be applied, so that two-job families enjoying very high incomes will be the main beneficiaries. This is an extraordinary policy outcome in the economic circumstances currently facing Australia. It represents a gross distortion of priorities. To be actively directing government assistance to those in well-paid employment while we have a million people out of work&mdash;370,900 of whom have not had a job in 12 months or more&mdash;makes a mockery of the social justice pretensions of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say a great deal more about this but, given the time limits that are imposed on us all now, thanks to the views of the Government and the Democrats about speeches during second reading debates, I intend to bring my speech to a close. We will have an opportunity for debating these issues further when the child-care legislation comes before us in the autumn sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 1993 does not set out the program details of the child-care rebate scheme. As I said earlier, that will be achieved in the changes to the Child Care Act in the autumn sittings. So, for this reason, the coalition will not oppose this particular Bill. However, in allowing this Bill to pass I would put the Minister on notice that she cannot assume the support of the coalition for the changes to the Child Care Act which are to follow later, if they include the tax file number provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will act in the best interests of Australians when that legislation is brought forward. If it threatens the basic freedoms and liberties of Australians, and if it disregards legitimate social justice principles, the coalition will have no part of it. </PARA>

However, the section did prove to be something of a problem, resulting in a report to Parliament in May last year by the Privacy Commissioner in which the commissioner indicated that he was not prepared to issue guidelines under this section until Parliament had tidied it up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Privacy Commissioner found several interpretation difficulties arising out of some of the provisions of section 135AA and some of these, he believed, would have given the Department of Health major administrative headaches. His view on this point was subsequently verified by the Office of General Counsel. The Privacy Commissioner felt these amendments were unacceptable for several reasons, probably the most significant of which was that they would prevent the follow-up of patients when adverse side effects of drugs or particular treatments became apparent several years after the person was treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that complete de-identification would also presumably have prevented patients from getting access in the future to their own medical records and their own information or data. At the time when the consumers of health services are&mdash;rightly&mdash;demanding more information from service providers and better access to their personal medical files and records, complete de-identification of data has the potential to cut across that trend. The Democrats certainly do not believe that that is a desirable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner also pointed out that the section may have the consequences of completely de-identifying data within five years of information relating to providers, prescribers and pharmacists. This, he believes, could hinder work in a diverse range of areas including specialist recognition, vocational registration, and the review of the Medicare schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other doubts were raised about the scope of the privacy guidelines, including the advice being received by the commissioner that the guidelines could only apply to data used in the conduct of the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs after 27 June 1991. I think the commissioner was well on the way to resolving these problems, but I concede doubts exist about the true meaning of the section. Therefore, in conclusion, I note that the doubts were sufficiently compelling to halt the Privacy Commissioner in his tracks and, in these circumstances, we will support the Government's redraft of this section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the second Bill, the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 1993, I want to say from the outset that this Bill has caused us some considerable concern&mdash;not because of its actual content but because of the bombshell dropped by Senator Crowley in this chamber a week or so ago when she admitted that the Government was looking at further extending the tax file number. Senator Crowley stated quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in general, what will be required is that all carers will provide their tax file number to the Medicare officers. </PARA>
<PARA>This was the first indication that we had from the Government of its intention to use the tax file number in this fashion. Although in the Bill there is no specific mention of it, we are surely at this stage&mdash;and we will be doing so in detail in committee&mdash;entitled to ask some quite serious questions. I say that given Senator Crowley's recent comments and also comments made in the Estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, is Senator Crowley telling us that the Government has firmly and finally decided to require carers to provide their tax file numbers to Medicare officers in order to receive the rebate? Or is this issue just being run up the flagpole to see how far it will go and how far the Government can get with it? Has she consulted with or sought the opinions of the Privacy Commissioner? What alternative identification measures have been looked at? What can Senator Crowley tell us about the realistic possibilities of high-level fraud within the scheme? Where does she see the Australian Taxation Office fitting into the scheme?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Democrats want to know how far along the Minister is in the actual detail of the scheme. I do not have any great difficulties with the notion of the Health Insurance Commission planning, developing and administering the payment of child-care rebates. If claims are to be made through Medicare offices, then presumably the commission will have to play a role. However, I do have some concerns about where this process is headed and we need to know from the Minister precisely what stage the process has reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we in the Senate pass this Bill today, are we giving the Health Insurance Commission the authority to go ahead and carry out some genuine work on how the scheme should be established and administered, and come back to the Parliament with those details set out in subsequent legislation, or are we just rubber stamping what has already been decided? I believe Senator Crowley owes the Senate an explanation on all this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, she needs to state categorically to the Senate that the passage of this Bill will not be seen as a mandate for the Health Insurance Commission to set up a system that is geared to having health care providers or anyone else provide their tax file numbers to Medicare officers. The fact of the matter is that this Government has never really given up on the idea of an Australia Card. What the Government could not get by being up-front about its intentions, it has proceeded to get by stealth and deceit&mdash;aided and abetted by the Liberal Party, I have to say&mdash;and steadily we have seen the growing encroachment of the tax file number requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Senator Newman has mentioned some of the areas where the tax file number changes have been made, but I must state quite categorically that every time on every single issue the Liberals have voted for it. I will go through the departments: data matching now covers the Department of Social Security, Department of Veterans' Affairs, Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Health Insurance Commission, the Commonwealth Employment Service, community services, Immigration and the Tax Office. It is a bit much for the Opposition to stand up and carry on now about tax file numbers and privacy and whether or not it is a de facto Australia Card,when the Opposition has been a part of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stress to Senator Newman that the Opposition has helped the Government to put it there. This Bill adds to the functions of the Health Insurance Commission and enables the commission to plan and establish a system under which it can pay rebates for child-care costs. The Democrats are prepared to accept this Bill, because we want to see the child-care rebate scheme up and running. However, we will not support a situation where people have to go down to their local Medicare office and give their tax file number to the Health Insurance Commission in order to claim a rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn briefly to the scheme itself and make a few comments. As far as the Democrats are concerned, accessible, affordable, quality child care is not a welfare service; it is an essential service and one which is necessary to give all family members, particularly women, the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put child care on the same basic list of human rights and entitlements as health care and education. We see child care as being especially crucial to four issues of basic fairness and equity in Australian society. Firstly, child care plays a crucial role in the current and future opportunities available to Australian women. Secondly, child care is crucial to ensure that women have the opportunity to make the transition from full-time to part-time employment. Thirdly, child care is crucial as it gives the options of more flexible employment chances for both men and women. Finally, child care is crucial to our recognition of the value of unpaid work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last concern often gets lost in the flurry of debate and it is one that can be very easily hijacked by those who think that a woman's place is in the home or by those who really do have a bent on getting married women out of the paid work force. But it is a crucial concern, and it is one that the Government's child-care rebate scheme will not address. The rebate will only be available to people who are in employment or training, studying, or looking for work, and, while I certainly understand the Government's priorities in this area and endorse the scheme, I really do not think it goes far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time we looked seriously at some formal recognition of unpaid work by what is generally called the invisible work force. At present we have no way of calculating the work done by the invisible work force because we simply ignore unpaid work. We do not take it into account when we calculate our gross domestic product or when we discuss national productivity. When we talk of industry policy, we do not consider the home care industry and its unpaid workers. We do not consider their wages or conditions and whether they have insurance to cover themselves if they are injured on the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically the policies and plans we make as a nation simply ignore the contribution of a large proportion of the Australian population, but it is a massive contribution. Its value has been estimated at between 52 per cent and 65 per cent of GDP. A survey last year by the Centre for Applied Research on the future indicates that Australian households actually produce about three times the output of Australia's entire manufacturing industry. So we have a lot of people out there doing a lot of work which is of value to us as a society but which is not measured or acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly concerned about two things which this rebate scheme does not address. Firstly, if we do not provide access to child-care for carers at home, we are not only refusing to acknowledge their significant economic contribution but also denying them the opportunity to fully participate in Australian society. Whether that participation is just working on the family farm, doing a few days voluntary work or undertaking some part-time study, it does not matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I think it is time we looked at the idea of a payment to carers who are staying at home and caring for children, whether those carers are men or women. I appreciate that there are some problems, not the least being the biases which many of the participants bring to this debate. But I really think we should be moving towards such a payment, and for this type of payment to be successful it must go hand in hand with a range of employment related measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must ensure that it is not an option that women feel forced to take, or one that they are forced to take through any sort of economic necessity because they cannot earn sufficient income from employment while also having to cover their child-care costs. It is rather annoying that in this debate we are constantly hearing everyone else trying to organise women's lives for them and tell them how to run their lives, but as this debate moves on we really should be talking about choice. In a changing employment and social environment it is no longer good enough to run the old ideologically driven argument either for or against a payment to carers&mdash;and I am not talking about $20 or $30 a week; I am talking about a payment at a level that gives men and women a real choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate must be about ensuring that both men and women can make choices which suit them, their families, their employment situations, their careers and their personal desires&mdash;without incurring a significant serious disadvantage because we do not recognise their contribution when one of their choices is to be a carer. The challenge before us is to recognise the value of unpaid work without further disadvantaging women. I cannot see why we cannot meet that challenge. I urge the Minister to look beyond this child-care rebate scheme and to begin an exploration of some of these issues, including a total redefinition of what we value formally as work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the two Bills before the Senate&mdash;the National Health Amendment Bill 1993 and the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 1993. If nothing else, it is ironic that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has decided to put these two Bills together to be debated cognately. The National Health Amendment Bill seeks to make amendments to the parent Act that will enable the Privacy Commissioner to issue guidelines in regard to the separation and de-identification of personalised Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits data. I hope these amendments and the subsequent guidelines will be the culmination of four years of the coalition's efforts to persuade this Government to develop a policy on how it handles the vast array of health information it maintains on individual Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern in this area developed when the pharmaceutical benefits scheme data went to the Health Insurance Commission. It crossed my mind to ask for how long the Health Insurance Commission kept data both from Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I and, I suppose, most other Australians were stunned to find out that the Health Insurance Commission kept the data indefinitely. So every visit to the doctor is recorded; the type of doctor we visit can be identified by provided number, whether it be a psychiatrist or a venereologist; the type of pathology test we have is recorded; and sometimes the type of treatment, especially the type of surgery, is recorded. All of that information can be obtained from the Health Insurance Commission and somebody could see fit to use the information indiscreetly or for some sort of commercial purpose. As has been seen from the ICAC investigations in New South Wales, some people in departments, such as social security, have been tempted to release private information. Every script that has been dispensed is also recorded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Estimates Committee C, I expressed my concern by asking the officers of the department whether it would be feasible to identify families with genetic disorders, such as phenylketonuria, thalassaemia and fibrocystic disease, from the type of doctor they visit, the type of treatment they receive and the type of drugs they are prescribed. The answer I was given was, `Yes, Senator, it would be possible'. That is something about which our community ought to be very concerned. That led me to push for a period of four years for the department to develop a much better privacy policy in relation to Medicare data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community has to debate&mdash;and this still has to take place properly; I believe that we are only on the edge of it&mdash;whether that data ought to depersonalised totally and kept in a form that can be used for epidemiological purposes or whether for the common good we ought to keep the information so that people can have revealed 20 years down the track whether they took a certain drug that has been discovered to have a deleterious effect later in their lives. That is a debate that I think the Australian community ought to have and that rightfully ought to be put on the agenda. I hope the press take it up; it has not shown much interest in it in recent years. This is something that we need to have a discussion about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation goes part way to allaying my fears. At least it looks at the depersonalisation of the information which can then be reconstituted within the guidelines set out. It is something that Australians ought to be concerned about. It is not too brave new worlde to suspect that in 20 years time a government may not be as reasonable about the information that it holds. The fact that the Health Insurance Commission has all that data ought to be of concern to Australians. I think the debate ought to start. The fact ought be made public that this sort of sensitive data is being stored and kept by the Government. At least now we have some move towards developing a policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, it is ironic that, at the same time as the Government is finalising a policy in relation to the retention of health records, it is introducing a Bill that seeks to extend the role of the Health Insurance Commission in a way that inevitably raises major privacy concerns. At the same time as the Senate is passing a Bill that will facilitate the introduction of privacy guidelines relating to Medicare and the PBS, it is being asked to pass another Bill which, on Senator Crowley's admission, will result in a further extension of the tax file number system to the administration of child-care cash rebates. While facilitating the introduction of one set of privacy guidelines, we are being asked to support a proposition that contradicts another set of privacy guidelines, namely the tax file number guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pertinent to trace the history of the development of the Government's health data retention policy. When one does, it becomes obvious that this policy certainly has not been nurtured by any concern from the government benches about this important issue. It has come from concern by people such as Senator Walters, Senator Watson and Dr Woods, who was formerly a member of the House of Representatives. They deserve special mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Newman has said, over a significant period I have pursued the Government during Estimates committee hearings. It is because of our constant efforts that the Government has been forced to address this issue of the vast amount of personalised health information which, since the inception of Medicare, has been retained in a readily identifiable form, albeit with another number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On 2 November 1989, in a speech on the 1988-89 annual report of the Health Insurance Commission, I first expressed my concern about the excessive amount of data held by this Government. In that speech, I asked the Health Insurance Commission to devote a section to privacy in its subsequent annual reports&mdash;it did not have anything on privacy in its annual report&mdash;so that the Parliament could examine how its data was dealt with and for how long it was kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate estimates hearings in May 1990, the Health Insurance Commission admitted that its Medicare claims data was maintained off-line indefinitely. It is interesting to look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for that estimates committee hearing. I was told that the data was held on-line for two years. I asked the question, `How long do you keep it off-line?' and I was told, `They hold it on-line for two years'. We then dragged out the fact that it was held off-line in paper form and possibly some other forms. I asked, `How long do you hold it for?'. Finally, after I had to squeeze the information out of them, the officers of the commission said, `We keep it indefinitely'. The commission also conceded that the retention of personalised health data was an issue that deserved debate and that there was a need to discuss a policy relating to the destruction and depersonalisation of this data. That was when the estimates committee had squeezed the witnesses to the point where they had to admit that maybe they ought to think about the fact that the commission kept this data for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an answer to questions on notice in the estimates hearings of September 1990, the Health Insurance Commission stated that it was looking at developing a policy for the depersonalisation of personalised health data. It also stated that previous questioning from Opposition senators had provided the impetus for this initiative and that it was hoped that agreement would be reached within the department within six months. Senator Crowley can see that admission by the department in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;not because her Government pressured for it but because over a period of time the Opposition pressured that department to address the issue of privacy in relation to health information. It was our pressuring that achieved that; it was nothing to do with the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 November, I reported to the Senate that the Health Insurance Commission had seen fit to include in its annual report&mdash;I was watching it by that time&mdash;a section on data security and privacy. When we give those five-minute speeches we may think that they are not listened to, but the commission must have listened because in that report was a little section on privacy and security. Slowly but surely we could see the wheels of change turning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the Additional Estimates in April 1991, the then Department of Health, Housing and Community Services announced that a draft joint departmental and Health Insurance Commission policy on the retention of health data was being developed and that it was expected that this policy would be finalised by the end of the month&mdash;we are getting closer. The department outlined the matters to be covered in this policy and said that it was hoped that a provisional policy statement would be released in July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process was expedited through the introduction of the Health Legislation (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Amendment Bill 1991 during the Autumn sittings. We should all remember this Bill which sought to introduce a revamped version of the Government's pharmacy black box. It also included provisions for the introduction of privacy guidelines in relation to the conduct of Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs. During the debate on this legislation, the coalition, supported by the Australian Democrats, achieved significant improvements to these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ensured that these guidelines had effective legal status. The legislation was amended to ensure that any breach of the guidelines would be considered to be a breach of the Privacy Act, meaning that the Privacy Commissioner would be able to use his investigative powers in relation to complaints. We also succeeded in winning amendments that ensured that the Privacy Commissioner's guidelines were subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny as disallowable instruments. Very importantly, given the Government's disinterest in this important issue, we also succeeded in amending the legislation to make it a legal requirement to devise these guidelines. This was a vast improvement on the Government's option of the Minister asking the Privacy Commissioner to devise guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, section 135AA(6) provided that the guidelines must outline procedures which would ensure that information relating to the Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits programs would be de-identified within five years of receipt if it were the subject of a current action. In addition, it ensured that Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits would be kept separately. This was another issue of concern to us because together the data provides an enormous amount of information about the status of an individual or of a family, especially the genetic status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two provisions went a long way towards fulfilling the coalition's long held concern that a policy be developed in relation to depersonalisation of health data. The Privacy Commissioner had issued draft guidelines with the Bill with regard to the pharmaceutical benefits program and was required to issue section 135AA guidelines or report to the Parliament by 1 April 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1991, I informed the Senate that the department's annual report stated that a draft policy covering confidentiality, release practice and data retention of Medicare and PBS data had been prepared for consultation with the Privacy Commissioner and that the policy would be finalised that financial year. The Privacy Commissioner proceeded to draft the required privacy guidelines which were circulated for comment in February 1992. However, the Privacy Commissioner did not issue the draft guidelines after receiving legal advice that they may not conform with section 135AA(6) of the National Health Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legal advice is certainly not cut and dried. The Privacy Commissioner acknowledged this when he reported to Parliament his failure to issue guidelines under this section. He stated that two of the concerns expressed by the Office of General Counsel were derived from a strict, literal construction of the language, while the third was much more arguable. As someone who has been involved in both the development of the policy and the legislative debates, I seriously doubt whether this legal advice reflects the Parliament's intentions. However, in the interests of certainty and ensuring that these guidelines are issued as soon as possible, the coalition will support these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are comforted by the fact that the Privacy Commissioner has not raised any serious problems with the Bill. He has stated that he will monitor the situation, in respect of both the definition of `database' in the Bill and the fact that the guidelines will no longer apply to paper files, and that he will report to Parliament any emerging difficulties. Hopefully, the passing of this Bill will result in the immediate implementation of the department's data retention policy, particularly the depersonalisation of all patient claims data within five years of receipt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one who has been pushing this barrow for so long, I was dismayed to hear the news last week that the Health Insurance Commission still has not commenced de-identifying any information collected since the inception of Medicare. I sincerely hope that a high priority will be given to commencing this process as soon as this legislation is passed by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to reiterate my concerns about the Government's decision, confirmed by Senator Crowley, to extend the use of the tax file number to its planned child-care cash rebate system. I take objection to a comment that Senator Lees made about the coalition not taking an interest in this issue and going along with the Government. Senator Lees should have sat, as I think her then colleague Senator Powell did, when we went through detail after detail of that tax file number system in the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to ensure that every effort was made to protect the interests of privacy in that area. In that situation the Government was again holding a gun to all of our heads in that it argued that there would be huge financial implications if the tax file number was not extended. This is not the case in this situation; this is a very different situation. I wanted to put that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was informed that during the election campaign the Australian Privacy Foundation was told that tax file numbers would not be required by either the department or the Health Insurance Commission to administer the child-care cash rebate system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last major extension of the tax file number system occurred in 1990 with the introduction of data-matching between the tax office, social security, Austudy and the first home owners scheme. When the then Minister for Social Security was questioned by the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee as to why the Government was breaking a previous commitment not to extend the use of the tax file number, he had the temerity to tell the committee that nothing was immutable and that the Government kept some promises but broke others. Was that news to us? No. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most common concern for those of us both in and outside the Parliament who jealously guard the confidentiality of personal information that we provide to government agencies is the ability of computers and nameless, faceless bureaucrats to gather all this information at a central point and compile a detailed profile about us without our knowledge. As Senator Newman said, it does not necessarily have to be at a central point. That is why the ever increasing use of tax file numbers is such a serious matter. The widespread use of this common identifier by so many government agencies means that any number of public servants have the ability, literally at their fingertips, to produce detailed secret profiles on all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latest encroachment is more insidious and more dangerous than the previous extension in 1990. At least then the Government tried to justify the extension of the tax file number on the basis that it was the price one paid for being in receipt of welfare assistance. Surely this Government will not claim that this universal child-care cash rebate is a welfare benefit&mdash;I think Senator Lees also made that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least back in 1990 the Government was able to put forward an argument that the extended use of tax file numbers in data matching would mean substantial financial gains to the Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's announcement in the Senate that the Health Insurance Commission would be using tax files numbers to administer the child-care cash rebate will render the greatest fear of all privacy protectors a virtual reality&mdash;that is, tax file numbers and Medicare numbers being maintained or accessed by the same agency.

But by and large at present women are the ones caring for children in the home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a matter of great concern to me over many years. The value of the mother's unpaid work in the home became obvious to me when my first wife died in 1980. Besides all the trauma, one has to be in that situation to recognise the economic costs. That is, of course, not the major consideration when one is in that situation. I think people must realise that that unpaid work is unrecognised, generally speaking, by governments in Australia and particularly by this Government. One must bear in mind that over the years any recognition of the work of the person in the home has dwindled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 1993 introduces the mechanism for Medicare offices to pay the child-care cash rebates for expenses incurred for work-related child care. The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) said in her second reading speech that the child-care cash rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents earning an income. I will not debate that now but were that so, one would really have to look at the distinction that is made between certain types of work-based child care and other types of child care. This is probably not the time to go into that debate, but that debate will certainly be a very real one during the Budget session. I want to focus on the logical implications of the Minister's statement and the inequities it illustrates in our tax and spending measures relating to certain aspects of child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, we can contrast the proposed child-care cash rebate for working parents with the child-care allowance proposed for mothers caring for children at home. This gets back to the question of unpaid work. The home child-care allowance of $30 a week is not as generous as it seems. The net family gain, with the abolition of the spouse rebate, is only $2.85 per week, regardless of the number of children. Spouses without children will continue to be eligible for the maximum spouse rebate, and that is a measure which I support. When we compare the $30 per week cash rebate with the annual amount of spouse rebate for those with no children, the difference is only $7.37 a week. That $7.37 a week does not increase according to the number of children being cared for at home; it is the same amount whether there is one child at home or 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child-care cash rebate scheme for work-related expenses is an important matter, and it is one in which I have had a great deal of interest. The maximum child-care cash rebate will be $1,466 a year, that is, $28.20 a week for one child; and $3,182 per annum, that is, $61.60 per week for two children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first inequity which I draw to the attention of the Senate. Some children and some families are apparently more equal than others. If a family has more children either at home or in outside child care, the level of subsidy has little regard to the number of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second inequity which I draw to the attention of the Senate is the enormous difference between the $7.37 per week received by a spouse at home caring for his or her own children and what is received by families with two income earners in the paid work force. In 1991-92, the Commonwealth  paid something like $435 million in child-care subsidies under the children's services program. Much of this went to  children in professional community care centres rather than children in family day care. Spending has grown from $65 million for 46,000 subsidised places in 1983 to $435 million for 193,000 subsidised places today. The per capita subsidy per place has increased faster than the number of places, from $1,413 in 1983 to $2,254 in June 1992. The average subsidy of $2,254 or $43 per week seems a lot better than the implicit subsidy for a child of $7.37 in the cashed-out spouse rebate. That is irrespective of the number of children a person is caring for&mdash;unpaid and unrecognised. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be argued, as the Minister and the Government do, that the purpose of the children's services program is for labour market support. I would have thought that the major purpose of any children's services program would be the welfare of the children. That is something that the Government should have regard to. </PARA>
<PARA>On a number of occasions in this chamber, particularly last year, I have raised with Senator Button the issue of persons who have been forced out of the paid work force. People are talking about married women being forced out of the paid work force. As far as I am concerned, that is not an issue. There should be a true freedom of choice. But nowadays the organisation that is pushing married women out of the paid work force is mostly the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators look at the current unemployment figures to see who has been pushed out of the paid work force, it will be clear to them that the majority are women. I have been trying to ask Senator Button what has happened to them and their families. Women who were pushed into the paid work force just to make ends meet and pay the bills are now, because of the Government's economic policies, being pushed out. Nobody worries about them; they are now unseen. The unemployment figures drop but they are disheartened job seekers. There are no jobs for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the Government recognised this problem and did something about it. It must do something about it in the name of equity and social justice. If it does not do something about it in the name of social justice, it certainly will not last another term because there is a widespread concern amongst the community that families on one income are getting a very raw deal. The income of that family is taxed as though there were no dependants. The income of a family ought to be taxed having regard to the number of persons dependent upon that family income. If that were so, there would be an additional tax free threshold for the spouse&mdash;whether male or female&mdash;and an additional tax free threshold for each of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the Government has proposed deferred bribes&mdash;that is, it is taking money from one family member and giving it to another. We will debate that when it comes along and see whether there are other possible measures to ensure that the money goes where it ought to go&mdash;that is, into the hands of the caring spouse. There are other ways of going about that. In general, the Government is proposing to take it out of the hip pocket of the taxpayer and put it into the purse of the carer. The danger of that, unless it is tied down with indexation, is that what will happen is the same as what happened to family allowances. In 1976 family allowances were introduced and the tax rebate system was abolished. Without costing the Government anything, tax rebates were cashed up into a family allowance to be paid to the spouse. In general, the money was taken out of the hip pocket of the taxpayer and put into the purse of the carer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since then the Government has been purloining and pinching money from the purses of mothers in Australia. That allowance is now worth only 62 per cent of what it was in 1976&mdash;an absolute disgrace. One of the reasons for that is that it has gone from the taxation area into the highly visible social services and social security area. As Senator Grimes and the Minister, I think it was the then Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, said at that particular stage, family allowances were never meant to be regarded as a social welfare payment but as a recognition that at any level of income a family with children is paying more than a family without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been improvements in the family payments scheme, which I and my union have been pressing very strongly. We were recognised by the former Prime Minister on one occasion for our efforts in regard to the family assistance supplement. I think that is very important. That certainly is a welfare measure which is very important. I acknowledge the work that was done and has been done on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But getting back to those working families&mdash;and I use the term working families whether or not both parents are in the paid work force; they are still working families&mdash;a skilled tradesman with three children is just above the family income supplement level. The family assistance supplement is now called the additional family payment. Those families have suffered enormous injustices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things need to be said about this. I concur with what has been said by those people who raised the issue of the tax file number. The Government has to give a full explanation to the Senate about that issue. We expressed concerns in this chamber during the Australia Card debate. We were given some sort of indication of the views of the people who are now on the Government front bench. I hope they will remember some of the things they said on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that the Senate would not and does not look kindly on measures taken by this Government or any other government to bring in the Australia Card through the backdoor. I am sure the people of Australia do not look kindly on it. I believe it is for the Minister, either in reply or more particularly in the committee stage of the debate, to set the minds of the Senate and the people of Australia at rest on that particular issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank my Senate colleagues for their contribution to this debate. I might address my initial remarks to the National Health Amendment Bill 1993. I think it is very important to acknowledge&mdash;it would be little minded not to but it would also be inaccurate not to&mdash;the contribution of Senator Patterson, in particular, to the changes in policy about privacy and the management of information about people in the Health Insurance Commission area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have said before, but I am very happy to say it again, that there is absolutely no doubt that Senator Patterson's questions in estimates committee hearings have made a difference. I am a bit surprised that Senator Patterson wonders whether or not departments read speeches that senators make in this place about annual reports. I would have thought that she would know that departments read those things very closely and that a particularly constructive contribution is taken notice of. There is no doubt that we would have to acknowledge Senator Patterson's contribution in this area. I think it is also important to note that there has been an agreed working-through of Senator Patterson's initiatives and the Government's concern about privacy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think these two pieces of legislation are remarkably apposite. Later, I will comment on the Health Insurance Commission and refute some of the claims that have been made, particularly by Senator Newman. The National Health Amendment Bill deals directly with the concerns about privacy that citizens have raised and that have been brought to the Government's attention by Senator Patterson. There is no doubt that this amending legislation goes directly to concerns about privacy. It puts clearly on the record the Government's concern for privacy of Medicare data&mdash;in particular, Health Insurance Commission data&mdash;and the seriousness with which it considers such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation seeks to repeal a section and to replace it so as to get it right this time. I think it is fair to say that the Privacy Commissioner could not proceed with the guidelines because, if he had, there was a clear understanding that he would have had to delete every piece of information of any kind of relevance every five years. That was never the intention of the amendment when it was introduced in the first place. Getting it right, or making clear what was intended, is much better managed with this amending piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true&mdash;and I was delighted to hear Senator Patterson mention it&mdash;that the process of de-identifying data does not mean that the aggregate data may not be available for epidemiologists and other people who have a proper and right need to study the information of epidemiological processes. There is also a concern about what we now know is a very long lead time for some diseases to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example is people who have suffered from and subsequently died of mesothelioma with up to a 25- or 40-year lead time. That is the kind of evidence that the Health Insurance Commission might have in a few years, and it is the sort of information that I think properly ought be held by a society. I am sure it would concern individual citizens who were looking for evidence of something about which they had seen a doctor once upon a time, but of which there was no further evidence and who, therefore, had been denied appropriate treatment or justice years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson said that we do need to have a community debate about this information. I think that is a very important point, because there are lively tensions between the requirements of privacy, the requirements of proper collection and maintenance of data for the benefit of individuals, and also the requirements for proper epidemiological studies, for example, or for better programs and planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was advised not too long ago of a doctor in England who was concerned about a patient who had died of a disease which could not be properly diagnosed. I think it was in the 1950s. Subsequently, as evidence of AIDS emerged, the doctor had some of the pathological sections that had been preserved examined and discovered, many years later, that this person had also died of AIDS. That is one of the bits and pieces of evidence that I think are very important in trying to pursue the course of a disease. What are we talking about, for example, in terms of the spread of a disease such as AIDS? We do need a balance, and I think this amending legislation addresses the need for that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I understand, Medicare is approaching its 10th birthday&mdash;I think it had its 9th birthday earlier this year&mdash;so it really has not yet held information for as long as 10 years. I think it is very appropriate that this process has been put in place with the applicable time lines, but I think it is also interesting to note that there has not been time for the Health Insurance Commission to have salted away too much data yet. It is not even 10 years old, so perhaps in this case we will have got the legislation and the timeliness exactly right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much more that could be said about the need for important health data. For example, in this country we are just establishing a genetic counselling service. There are certainly some families for which genetic counselling and the information that can be provided is of great importance, particularly in their decisions of whether or not to proceed with having children. I am not sure whether thalassaemia has been cited in this debate already, but thalassaemia is one disease of concern. Parents who know about the genetic propensity for that within their families may decide not to have children, but it would also be very useful for that information to be held somewhere&mdash;perhaps with the family, perhaps with some other authority for further and future reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there have been some discussions recently in the newspapers about Huntington's chorea. As I understand that disease, it has something like a forty-year dormant period before it takes its effect. It is a genetic disease, and again if we were looking at the information we would need to maintain an adequate genetic counselling service and the proper information that that would provide to society as well as to individuals, then of course we would have to balance the need to know with the protection of privacy of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill. This is a simple, innocent little Bill whose provisions have been used in this debate to whack a whole lot of other irrelevancies around the head. Senator Newman has got it wrong. It seems to me that she is now devoted to maintaining a wrong position on this. Senator Newman is intending to support this legislation. She knows she can support it because it is quite innocent legislation. It does not address any of the things that she was trawling as red herrings across the debate today.

Child-care users have never been considered as having to provide their tax file number, and never would. There is no point at all in their doing that; it is not part of the proposal. I say again, for the benefit of Senator Newman, the details have not been finalised; they are being considered. But, somewhere along the line, child-care users will have to produce evidence that they have used child care, usually a receipt. They would take that along to the Medicare office and, according to the proposed formula, if it can be matched against a properly registered child-care provider, they would be eligible for the cash rebate, calculated on how much they have paid and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees suggested that the tax file number might also be attached to the collector of the rebate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the serious points at issue. I would like to make it clear that the Government is very concerned to get it right.

However, I do not understand how the Opposition could suggest that the Government is concerned about privacy, on the one hand, and totally disregarding of privacy on the other. Of course we are very concerned about the privacy matters here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not an example of child care for millionaires at all. I will read some facts and figures. Most importantly, we have added the child-care cash rebate on top of the fee relief, and the fee relief proposals address assistance for people at the low income level. The cash rebate recognises child care as a cost against earning income and, like every other rebate for costs against earning income, it is not income tested. I sincerely hope the honourable senator opposite heard that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a family with an income of up to $24,000&mdash;for example, a hairdresser&mdash;the child-care assistance per week would be $92.50 and cash rebate eligibility would be a further $2.85. For a family with an income of $40,000&mdash;for example, a waiter or hairdresser earning $22,000 and a teacher's aid earning $18,000&mdash;the child-care assistance is currently $50.70 and cash rebate eligibility is $15.40. I will skip some of the other examples and go to a family with an income of $60,000. For a male primary school teacher earning $35,000 and a female data processor earning $25,000, with a joint family income of $60,000, the eligibility for child-care assistance or fee relief is nil and eligibility under the cash rebate is $28.20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Newman will find that this is anything but child care for millionaires. In conjunction with our fee relief or child-care assistance, it is an addition which recognises child care as a cost against earning income. As I say, it is like other costs against earning income and is not income tested. Because it comes on top of our very fair fee relief system or child-care assistance, there is no skewing of child-care assistance to millionaires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, $28.20 is the maximum figure. Once one becomes eligible for the child-care cash rebate, the maximum one can receive&mdash;whatever one's income is above $60,000&mdash;is $28.20, which does not sound like a child-care rebate for millionaires.

The financial impact statement accompanying the explanatory memorandum says that the estimated cost will be $2.5 million. Is it not a fact that this really will be not a proposal but, as it says here, the planning and establishment of a cash rebate scheme?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is there not a more efficient method of providing for the child-care rebate? The people who will be eligible for the rebate are in fact earning income. Therefore, would not a simpler approach be that part of the income as decided by the Government, as the Minister was indicating before, be eligible for a tax rebate and that it could all be done through the taxation system without any substantial cost&mdash;and certainly without the cost of $2.5 million? I would have thought that that might be the way of going about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important point is that many of the people who will be eligible for a cash rebate for child care do not earn income.

The standard proposal that Senator Harradine is floating would quite clearly not operate for thousands of women who would, under our proposal, be eligible for a rebate for child care&mdash;women who would not be earning any income and would not be eligible for the payment of any tax at all, in many cases.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand perfectly well that the proposed rebate is to cover parents using child care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work. Clearly, the people in the three latter categories may not be earning income. That is not the point. An overwhelming number of persons eligible for this child-care cash rebate will be earning money. Perhaps the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) would be able to give the chamber an estimate of how many people in each of those categories will be eligible for a child-care cash rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her second reading speech, the Minister indicated that an estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from the scheme. So she must have a fair idea of how many of those people are in employment, how many are in training, how many are studying and how many are looking for work. At least in respect of those who are in employment, has the Government considered making the child-care cash rebate part of the taxation system and, therefore, not a substantial burden on the taxpayer, which it will inevitably be as a result of its payment through Medicare offices?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The projections for users of child care and for children who will benefit are not entirely aggregate figures but they are in large part. It is therefore very difficult to give details of how many of these people are women in the work force and how many are women studying, et cetera. The other important point is that women move between one category and another. So it is difficult to give hard numbers on that. I will certainly see whether the department has anything further which it can provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed payment of the rebate through the Medicare offices was to recognise the importance of a return every week or fortnight to those families struggling to make ends meet. This is of great assistance to people, particularly those at the lower end of the income scale. Not many families can wait for a rebate at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to know that many families do not pay tax, but there are many others who pay a modest amount of tax and therefore would not benefit from the rebate in the same way. This measure is to take account of the needs that we know many families express. There needs to be ease of access to the payment of child care. It needs to be in a place that those families are familiar and comfortable with and the payment needs to be paid regularly so that they are not out of pocket over the long haul in dealing with the very important cost of child care. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will follow on from the issues that Senator Harradine has been addressing. I am glad to see that, in fact, despite the response of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) on the second reading, it is not just the Opposition, including me, that have concerns about what the Government is up to, but clearly all speakers in this debate have concerns about this matter. Perhaps the Minister should look in the mirror and ask herself why she should be so out of step with honourable senators who are very supportive of child-care assistance for Australian families but are very concerned about what the Government is up to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said in her second reading speech that Senator Newman had got it wrong. She said that I was devoted to maintaining my wrong position, that I was trying to draw red herrings across the trial and that I was deliberately muddying the waters. She also said that it is not true what I said about what the Government is up to. The trouble I have with that is that on 6 May the Minister told the Senate, in an answer to a question from me, that tax file numbers would be provided to Medicare offices. No doubt the Minister remembers that herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Estimates Committee C hearings on 10 May I quoted from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and reminded the Minister what she said. I said, `That is the answer you gave' and she said, `Yes, it was'. There is no doubt that that is what the Minister said was going to happen. During the estimates committee hearings the officers had quite a bit to say about this whole matter as well. The committee was told by Mr Wight:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention at this stage is that those administrative arrangements will include carers providing their tax file number to become approved carers. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Wight went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Health Insurance Commission will be issuing the carer provider number, one of the requirements to approve a carer is that the Health Insurance Commission has received the tax file number, because that will be part of the approval process. So it has to be the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>So if I have got it wrong, that is where I got it wrong from. Senator Tate was also, despite the fact that he is a member of the Government, obviously a bit concerned about what was going on too. He asked some intelligent sorts of questions as befit an intelligent man. Some of the things that I would like to draw to the Minister's attention are that this same Mr Wight, further on in the committee hearing, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have looked at a number of alternative methods of doing it, but that was the proposal that the Government has accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>Where am I so wrong when I say that the Government is moving down the track to extend the use of tax file numbers, and that we are very concerned because they are going to be given to the Health Insurance Commission? I do not know whether the Minister has missed a cog along the way, but that is what we are concerned about. As I said in my speech at the second reading stage, not only is it an extension of the tax file number, but also, as far as I know, it is the first time that somebody who is not a beneficiary of Government revenue will have to provide his or her tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, it is not the people who will get the child care who are being asked to provide their tax file number, it is the person who will be providing the service. In the previous extensions of the tax file number, it was not the provider who had to provide the tax file number; it was the person who was receiving the Government revenue. There is some argument for that, with proper privacy protection, but not for this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bansemer, another official at the estimates hearings, was also good enough to acknowledge that this proposal is subject to privacy concerns and said that advice was being sought about it. Did the Government go to the Privacy Commissioner? No. As I understand it, in rough terms, the Law Reform Commission has a contract with the department to re-do all the children's legislation. It has been asked to look at the amendments to the Child Care Act and also to have a chat to the Privacy Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the Government would have realised that this is a very sensitive issue. It is a proposal fraught with difficulties and political sensitivities, and fears on the part of citizens of an invasion of their privacy. Before the Government even told the department that&mdash;in Mr Wight's words&mdash;this was the proposal that the Government had accepted, it should have gone to the Privacy Commissioner and said, `How would we go if we went down this track?', and tried to push the Privacy Commissioner into a corner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine's questions were pretty interesting. As I mentioned at the second reading stage, at the time of the last election, the coalition had a policy for extra child-care assistance. We had a proposal as to how it could be regulated without an invasion of privacy. In the estimates committee hearings, I asked whether the department had considered the coalition's proposal that the Tax Office provide a registered carer's number to child carers which would be quoted on all rebate claim forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still think that was a very reasonable way to go. It meant that if one wanted to care for somebody's children, one would get from the Tax Office a child carer's number which would be quoted on all rebate forms by the person who was receiving the child care. That is not an unreasonable way of providing some sort of supervision of the system to prevent fraud without going down this dangerous track of extending the invasion of privacy of the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department did not give me a direct answer as to whether it had investigated this proposal&mdash;sometimes one only realises this after studying the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a few days later. The department suggested it was basically the same proposal; I presume it means the same proposal as the Government's. It certainly is not. It worries me, when I see that answer now, to realise that, if the officer really meant what he said, it shows a pretty keen lack of understanding of this whole problem of privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to prolong this debate, but I am concerned that the Minister can get up here and, by throwing rocks around the place, think that she has been pretty smart. There is real concern on all sides of this Parliament&mdash;I remind the Minister of Senator Tate's concern&mdash;about what the Government is proposing. We are being asked to support legislation which will mean expenditure of over $2 million which will plan to put a system in place&mdash;and I never suggested anything other than that in my speech&mdash;about which we have no information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We flag pretty strongly to the Government that we will not support this legislation if the Government is going to extend the use of the tax file number in the manner which, it appears from the estimates committee hearings and from the Minister's own answer in Question Time recently, it is. We will not support that sort of measure. If the Government does not want to waste $2 million, it might start changing direction right now. I am very glad, for the sake of both the Government and the taxpayers, that the Government has sufficient warning. It now has plenty of time to reassess the direction in which it is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not quite get the Minister's words down, but in response to Senator Harradine she gave me the impression that maybe the Government was moving position on this and that it was looking to establish a method for the keeping of separate information. I would like to know what the Minister really meant by that. After all, the critical issue is that there cannot be data-matching. We have to keep this sort of information on citizens separate, so that perhaps under another government of the future there can be no opportunity for big brother and for the George Orwell view of the world to take over in Australia. We do not want the government of the day to have a massive database on all citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a proposal with which the Government seems to be going forward unthinkingly. Both the Minister and the department seem to be going along helter-skelter, refusing to acknowledge that it could even be a problem, instead preferring to chuck rocks at me as if somehow that will make it all go away. It will not go away and the Government should be thankful for the fact that this chamber is flagging the view right now that there will not be support for the sort of proposal we think it is on about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal is canvassed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of both Question Time and Estimates Committee C. If the Government is walking away from that, we would like to know that and we would like to know which way it is going now. Perhaps it might be appropriate for the Minister to tell us what she meant in her answer to Senator Harradine about establishing a method for providing separate information. </PARA>

When the Australian Privacy Foundation asked what all this was about, Minister Staples' staff and Mr Gration gave total assurances, which were confirmed and written down, that there would not be the use of the tax file number.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events were that after the problem with the five per cent, the lack of deposit requirement, was discovered&mdash;and that was the first occasion, not only since I have been Minister in the portfolio but, to the best of my knowledge, in a number of years prior to that, that there has been any evidence of any system failure in the department in respect of tender processes&mdash;I asked the secretary to my department to do two things: to investigate the issue immediately as to what happened and why it happened; and to carry out a rigorous examination of all of the tender processes that the department had been responsible for during that time. I might add that I said `everything', and I am told that that even included examination of tenders for the acquisition of computer equipment, for example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that, the secretary to the department advised me that the investigation in fact was already under way. I might add that one of my ministerial colleagues did say to me at the time, when I was explaining to him what I proposed to do, `If you examine any process with the level of scrutiny that you have asked for&mdash;any process&mdash;you are almost bound to find something'. Be that as it may, I saw that I had no other responsible choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I became aware of the problem when, following that examination, I had a meeting with officers of my department and the Attorney-General's Department which indicated to me that there could be a potential problem in respect of defects in the drafting. At that point in time, a number of options were being fairly rigorously debated between the lawyers themselves. I had also asked Mr Evans to ensure that, if it was desirable, as well as AG's being involved&mdash;`you get a fleet of lawyers onto this' I think was the expression I used&mdash;he should have access to the best possible advice from the private commercial bar.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Senate might be aware, in the past conditions of service for ADF members deployed overseas were authorised under several pieces of legislation and were also administered in a range of different departments. For example, tax concessions, of course, were administered by the Treasury; deployment allowances by the Department of Industrial Relations; and compensation by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis, it sometimes resulted in delays and situations where personnel were deployed overseas without knowing exactly what their entitlements would be. With the establishment of a framework of deployment conditions of service, these conditions will no longer be made on a case-by-case basis. The establishment of the framework coordinates the authorisation of the entitlements so that delays will not occur in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the future, a deployment will be declared warlike or non-warlike and the full range of service conditions associated with each situation can be assumed approved. The declaration of deployment, warlike or non-warlike, will be made by the Minister for Defence and that will be done in consultation with the Prime Minister in each case. The Government has also approved an enhanced defence home loan assistance benefit for ADF personnel who served or are serving in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, soldiers who have completed operational service in Somalia will now have a waiver of the six-year qualifying requirement and an additional three years of loan subsidy and may, depending on whether they have any further service, have the maximum loan subsidy period extended from 20 years to 25 years. The Government hopes that this framework will provide a substantial incentive to personnel returning from these areas to invest in their own homes. The benefit will now be available, of course, for future overseas deployments that are also declared warlike.</PARA>

The court case in fact did not have that effect but, effectively, the court&mdash;and this is what I was explaining when I got cut off before&mdash;took over the process on the basis of agreements that were reached, and this is referred to in Mr Gyles's advice, between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My involvement was as I described it.

That matter was later ratified by the court in these terms&mdash;I quote the court order, and this is what was conveyed to me: that the Commonwealth should `accept and treat as valid any tender or revised tender complying with a ministerial direction under which the tender process was conducted'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect it makes a bit of a change to be talking about the consequences of disasters of previous generations. The blanket declaration concerning shipwrecks that we have made is designed to ensure that the wrecks and their relics are protected from disturbance, damage and plunder.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To supplement that program the Government has introduced an amnesty from 1 May to 30 October 1993 so that people who had a relic in their possession before 1 April may report that without penalty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the first part of Senator Bourne's question, no, I do not accept that officers of the department have undermined the Government's policy on pay television, nor do I think that any of the evidence supports that. What has happened&mdash;and I regret it&mdash;is that unnecessary confusion in the industry has been caused by two identifiable problems: firstly, the failure to impose a deposit as had previously been imposed in respect of tenders; and, secondly, the problem with this drafting matter which has now had the consequences that it has indicated. I might add that my advice is that, as a result of this scrupulous, rigorous examination of all of the tender processes, there are no more problems with this process. But that, I have to say, could hardly be termed as undermining the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Am I aware of industry views about a deregulatory approach? Of course I am. I respect the Democrats' position on this.

All I can do is repeat what I said earlier. The Opposition, of course, supported the Government's position on the price based system.

I will table that, but there is something in it that I think is relevant and which the Government has to accept responsibility for. Page 15 of this document lays out the Ministers who have been in this portfolio. Anecdotal evidence has it that a Minister spends an average of about a year in a portfolio, which I think is unsatisfactory. What this graphically demonstrates&mdash;and I was well aware of it at the time&mdash;is that when I assumed portfolio responsibility for this department in May last year I was the fourth Minister in less than a year to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia will be represented at this week's meeting in Singapore which does represent a significant step forward in the implementation of Australian policy objectives on regional security. The meeting is essentially an officials level prelude to the ministerial level ASEAN PMC conference which is designed to sharpen regional focus on security questions and to develop some strategies by which governments can engage themselves more specifically in the consideration of appropriate policy responses to regional security in the post-Cold War world. Australia will be going to the meeting this week, and hopefully again in July, with some quite specific suggestions in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to the heart of the matter: because this is not a question of policy. On this particular matter, I agree with Senator Alston: this is a matter of arcane legal drafting for which nobody, I thought, sensibly could even suggest that a Minister could be reasonably responsible. Today I tabled in the Senate advice from Mr Gyles QC and advice from the Attorney-General. It is all important but I will read out the two key paragraphs in the Attorney-General's advice that indicate what the problem was. They are contained in the Attorney-General's advice; honourable senators can read it themselves. The problem was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view the notice of 18 January 1993 was defective in that it did not specify, as required by clause 4, the area&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will relate. What it did was set out a number of `locations'&mdash;eg `Sydney', Wollongong', `Brisbane', `Gold Coast' etc&mdash;and indicate the number of licences which would be available in each `location'. There is nothing in the statutory documents which is of any assistance in ascertaining the boundaries of the `locations'. It is not clear, for example, where the boundaries of `Sydney' end and `Wollongong' begin or whether there is a gap between them. It is not clear to me from the Radio Communications Act 1983 or the Determination what is meant by the `area' to which the licence relates. Given the clear objective of the Act to minimise interference (see Part IV (radio frequency planning); ss.24, 25, 25A (conditions of transmitter licences) and Part IX (settlement of interference disputes)), I think that the Determination must have intended that either be capable of being determined with certainty from the terms of the invitation to tender of itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if the contrary view is taken as to `area', I think there can be little doubt that for the notice to state: `the frequencies to which this tender relates lie within the bands 2076-2111 MHz or 2300-2400 MHz as specified in the MDS Band Plan' is not to specify `the frequency to which the licence will relate' as required by the Determination. The Frequency Band Plan prepared under section 19 of the Act on 9 June 1988 (as amended on 3 June 1992 and 23 September 1992), which I assume is the `MDS Band Plan' referred to, is of no assistance in allocating a particular frequency or frequency band to any particular licence offered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 May, Senator Chamarette asked me a question without notice on exploration and mining of resources in or near the Ningaloo Marine Park and I undertook to provide further information. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, has provided the following supplementary reply. The legislation listed in the previous answer as being applicable in certain circumstances in relation to oil exploration or drilling in waters administered by Western Australia in or near Ningaloo Marine Park could only be applied if a decision by a Commonwealth Minister or agency became necessary. The proposed activity does not seem to be in an area of direct Commonwealth responsibility and there appears at present to be no requirement for a Commonwealth decision that would trigger Commonwealth legislation. These are the points that were made in the ABC radio interview to which Senator Chamarette refers.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Superannuation was pretty good, but communications, I have to say, is even faster moving. I will give the Senate an example of the interest people take in what goes on around the world. I got a phone call this morning from an interested party in Los Angeles&mdash;and there are very many offshore, although the numbers are rapidly diminishing. The proposition that was put to me was: `I cannot believe it. We have been reading these stories for months now about this bloke Collins and it just seems to go from bad to worse. How can he possibly still be the Minister?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said, `The nature of the system is that the Prime Minister is the one who calls the shots. The Prime Minister is the one who intervenes and tells Senator Collins how to run his policies, when to hit MDS on the head and when to make all sorts of about-faces. The Prime Minister is the one who goes on the Laurie Oakes program and fundamentally changes policies, and Senator Collins is the fall guy. So you can understand why the Prime Minister owes him one'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my telephone correspondent said, `That is all very well but I hope you blokes appreciate the damage that is being done to Australia's reputation. You are lurching from crisis to crisis. We know you are interested in a republic. You have the banana part well and truly right at this stage. As far as we are concerned, you would be safer making policy commitments in Guatemala'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that we all face in this area is that one expects certain standards from a Minister. It is fair to say that over the years the definition has changed to a certain extent. But no-one for a moment would suggest that we have now reached the stage where a Minister can now close his or her eyes, ignore all the implications of a decision or an action that he or she is about to take and simply sign away, or sign off. Yet that is precisely what has happened in this instance and in a number of recent instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to take today's answers in Question Time to get some great enlightenment on the way in which Senator Collins conducts business. He was asked twice whether it was a fact that Mr Graham Evans was acutely aware of the so-called technical deficiencies at the time of the Stokes court case, which was about six weeks ago, and whether that was brought to the Minister's attention at that time. All we got was the usual blithering nonsense about, `I was first made aware of this a couple of weeks ago when the five per cent problem surfaced. Since then I have taken a lot of advice and I have had discussions'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still do not know the answer to that question. Was Senator Collins informed at the time by the head of his department that there were serious technical deficiencies? Indeed, why did the department itself not commission legal advice at that time? Why did the Minister not take any interest in proceedings? Why did he not ensure that the department was fully briefed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only legal advice the Government seems to get is after the event, when the thing has blown up and there are huge problems. Then the Government will go off and pay the high flying silks to tell it how to get out of it, if at all possible. And, of course, the unpalatable advice from Mr Gyles was that the Government simply could not get out of it. So the Government had to abort this MDS process twice in the space of less than six months. The way things are going we will have more processes than we have Ministers!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To compound the felony, the Minister was also asked what his position was in relation to the determination, and bear in mind it is the determination from which this flows. I was very interested to hear the Minister's answers because he did actually provide a lot more information than usual. The whole thrust of yesterday's snow job&mdash;with joint press releases, letters from the secretary and a press release from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;was basically to suggest that the determination was okay but it was the notification that got it wrong because it did not comply with the requirements spelled out in the determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I asked Senator Collins today whether it was a fact that the determination prescribed a sequential allocation system which was quite at odds with the approach that the department itself had intended to take by way of a pooling system. That is where this went off the rails. Interestingly, the Minister does not say, `This was not brought to my attention. I did not read the document'. I suppose he says, `I read it'&mdash;meaning, `I did more than glance at it'&mdash;but his defence this time is, `Why should I be expected to pick it up?'. If he paid attention, I would tell him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason the Minister ought to have picked this up is that he should have had advice from his department; he should have sought information from his staff; he should have wanted to know the implications of this document. But, once again, he took the coward's way out. He said, `If they want to serve it up to me, I will sign it. If there are problems, it is no concern of mine because there are others with obligations'. The fact is that the Minister did not take advice from anyone. He just signed on the dotted line and said, `How could I be expected to know that there were all these difficult problems?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate: why has Mr Evans offered to fall on his sword? I suppose the reason Senator Collins does not want to fall on his sword is he does not want to do damage to the instrument, and I can understand that. But one would have thought the logic of that is that if it is good enough for the secretary to the department to accept responsibility for not detecting that technical deficiency, why is it not good enough for those with ultimate responsibility?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Evans has some sense of propriety and some sense of decency. He understands the rules which say, `You are responsible for the actions of your subordinates'. Why does he offer to resign? He says others in the department tried to talk him out of it. But, no, he thought the honourable course was to offer to resign. We know why Mr Keating would not accept the offer&mdash;because, if he did, the inexorable logic is that the ultimate responsibility resides with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely why Senator Collins will not accept his own responsibilities and will not face up to this problem. It was perfectly within his capacity to get advice and perfectly easy, I would have thought, for him to seek advice and consult lawyers. There is no shortage of them&mdash;he has a principal legal adviser. But once again he did not bother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an isolated instance, because we only have to go to that other notorious episode which has now been flick passed to what is called the Pearce inquiry, whose terms of responsibility are to finger whoever can possibly be identified as responsible other than the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is someone who has been in the job now for almost 12 months and who has presided over a number of diasters. In particular, he presided over the MDS tender process, which involved the payment of a five per cent deposit, and presumably was still aware of the consequences of that. On 19 January he sat up in Darwin, did not bother to call on his department or his staff, did not bother to seek any outside advice and simply said, `Give it to me and I will sign it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it is not just that it happened on one occasion&mdash;and I would have thought that once was sufficient for hanging purposes&mdash;but the Minister has, within his own definition, been a systematic failure because he has consistently failed to seek advice when it has been appropriate to do so. He has not shown an interest in understanding the implications of matters put before him. He does not seriously suggest that a determination to start the process of licence applications for MDS is somehow just another piece of paper. I am sure that even the Minister acknowledges that that had very serious consequences in the same way that the satellite licence process started off a very serious chain of events which led to people bidding $389 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though these are documents that one does not have to scrutinise very carefully. That is the Jim Cairns defence: `I really don't take an interest in these matters unless I'm required to do so'. What we have had is a series of episodes of this Minister not taking advice when he should have and not wanting to understand the legal implications when he should have, but simply signing off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having looked at the legal advice that preceded the unprecedented decision to basically cancel the MDS process on the first occasion, we now know that Mr John Doherty, the principal legal adviser in the department, advised senior departmental officers in very strong terms&mdash;Senator Collins says by Email&mdash;that there was a very real danger of any advice that the Minister might give to the tribunal by way of information on government policy being ultra vires; in other words, beyond the power that he had because it would conflict with the objects of the Act. It seems extraordinary that in subsequently having a number of discussions&mdash;as Senator Collins says, by way of teleconference&mdash;over a period of several days with a number of legal officers he did not at any stage ask for written legal advice. Yet that seems to be the case. The only written legal advice that he got&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is well after the event. That is precisely what I keep saying to the Minister: 5 February is too late. The critical dates were 28 and 29 January. That is when the Minister needed the legal advice. That is when he ought to have been aware of the consequences of an unprecedented intervention. Yet he sought no legal advice. We know there was legal advice from Mr Doherty, but the Minister says it did not get to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what I said about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says that is not what he said about it. As I recall from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, what he said was that it was Emailed to Roger Beale, Christine Goode and Mr Buettel. The Minister said, `It did not come to me and nor should it have'. I take that to mean that at no stage did the Minister receive written legal advice before he cancelled that process. If that is wrong, I will be very interested to hear it. It is perfectly plain from the material that is available to date that he did not bother seeking legal advice in the same way as he did not get legal advice from Roger Beale. All he got was a note telling him that he could sign something. That is a vastly different proposition, drawing to the Minister's attention that the provisions of the Act in no way constitute legal advice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great concern I think everyone in the industry has&mdash;and which everyone in the wider community by now ought to have&mdash;is that we have had a succession of fiascos presided over by this Minister who seems to have no concept of the notion of ministerial responsibility. It is one thing to be in opposition in the Northern Territory, he tells us, and to be able to trot out all these high sounding statements, presumably with a straight face&mdash;or po-faced as he likes to call it&mdash;when he is trying to get the scalp of someone else. Is he seriously suggesting that somehow those statements are just ones of convenience not to be taken seriously&mdash;indeed, dishonest representations? I hope he is not. I at least give him credit for not doing that sort of thing in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, one has to accept that the Minister has some understanding of the concept of ministerial responsibility and he does indeed acknowledge that there are circumstances in which Ministers ought to be held responsible for the actions of others. Not for a moment did I understand him to demur from Senator Tierney's allegation that he used the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any Minister who would have just blithely said "approved" at the end of a memo like that deserves to be sacked.</PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances, Senator Collins is clearly acknowledging that someone who blithely signs a document without bothering to read it, takes advice or ruminates on the consequences can be culpable and guilty of ministerial failure. That has to be the consequence of that statement. If ever a description was apt, I would have thought that one was. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister is totally unfit to hold such a senior position in any government. How can a Minister allow himself to be snowed to that extent by his department?</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator Collins is again acknowledging that a Minister can, in certain circumstances, be responsible for the actions of his department. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to hear any of them tell me that a Minister who is not capable of controlling his department to that gross extent is fit to be on the front bench of any government.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Senator Collins is clearly conceding that a Minister&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not care less; I am not interested in the slightest. I am simply saying that Senator Collins is on the public record making it clear that there are circumstances in which a Minister must be held accountable for the actions of his department. If ever there was a series of examples of a Minister being totally and culpably negligent in not taking notice of what goes on in his department, in not bothering to seek advice and in not bothering to look at the implications of decisions and documents placed before him, it is the series of events that we have had over recent weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that this Minister seems to think that all he has to do is tough it out, basically ignore the question if it is embarrassing, basically go on providing non-responsive answers, and hoping that over time the issue will go away. It is not going to go away, and nor should it. It will not go away until the Minister accepts his ultimate responsibility and accepts that he had a role to play&mdash;it is just not good enough to blame bureaucrats&mdash;in all of these various situations where he demonstrably failed to get involved; where he was either kept in the dark by his own department, and I have not heard him say that; or where he simply did not want to know.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospective tenderer has a look in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> to see what is available. I think there is a mailing list of over 500 organisations that regularly tender for telecommunications and broadcasting issues. This one cuts across both: it is both a telecommunications and broadcasting matter. Basically, the gazettal notice just says, `Send for the information paper'. This is the document on which the tenderers base their tender. Senator Alston knows that, despite trying to make bricks without straw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People do not normally go back to the determination and start searching it for abstruse legal difficulties. They get the information paper&mdash;that is what it is for&mdash;and they base their tender on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. That is how arcane a situation this is. Having had this matter brought to my attention in a detailed way, with the advice I have now tabled in the Senate, what is being lost in this debate is what an arcane situation would have to have arisen for this to have ever caused a problem. I will tell the Senate what would have happened in order for people to understand why I took the responsible decision that I did to take this to Cabinet and recommend abrogation&mdash;not an easy course politically, and I was well aware of it, but it was the only responsible course, in my view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person applied for and received the information paper under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I just ask people to read it;  Senator Alston is always talking about reading things but he clearly has not read this&mdash;it will tell him not only that he cannot apply for an individual channel, but also that if he does his tender will be invalid. That is what it tells us&mdash;it is in here. I do have not time to quote it all. I would say to anyone with a serious interest in nailing down responsibility, `Read it yourself'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information paper on which all normal tenderers would base their detailed bid states that if a person applies for an individual channel&mdash;that is, if someone says, `I want channel five in Sydney'&mdash;his tender will be ruled invalid. That is correct. For someone to have actually caused a problem, if this had not been discovered&mdash;the full detail of it was only discovered because of the re-examination of all the tender documents by a fleet of lawyers&mdash;he would have had to have completely acted against the information in the information paper and run the risk, according to the information paper, of having his tender ruled invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He would have had to have gone back to the original determination and found this obscure drafting difficulty. And despite Senator Alston's unbelievable assertions, it is an obscure problem, referring to the singular instead of the plural in the determination. It was originally drafted, I was told not unreasonably, by applying the normal rules of statutory interpretation that single means plural except where otherwise determined. Of course, we should have picked that up straight away&mdash;Senator Alston would have. That is rubbish, and he knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having found that arcane legal difficulty in drafting and ignoring the information paper&mdash;this is the scenario that potentially could have occurred, which is why I took a submission to Cabinet recommending abrogation as being the only responsible way of handling a problem once it had been directly brought to my attention&mdash;what could have happened was this: tenderer X, this shyster who wants to put in a shonk bid, ignores the advice in the information paper that tells him that if he does this his tender will be ruled invalid, picks up the drafting difficulty in the determination, and puts in a tender for channel 5 in Sydney for $20 or $100. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a process that is well understood by the industry and which it routinely follows. If tenderer Y puts in a genuine tender based on the detailed advice in the information paper&mdash;I do not know what these licences are worth because the market will determine that, but let us say $1 million&mdash;at the time of allocation the top six prices are pulled out of the box and the six channels are then allocated by the department. The other matter that has not been referred to in this debate by Senator Alston is that the channel numbers and frequencies are secret information. The channel numbers and frequencies are held by the department in total security and are not allocated until the six licences are allocated in descending order of bids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What then happens is that the highest tenderer gets channel 1, the next highest tenderer gets channel 2 and so on down to channel 5. In terms of our legal advice I stress what could have happened is that if the shonky bidder got his $20 bid for the single channel, instead of one licence in a group of licences, and the Government then allocated successful tenderer Y channel 5 for a million dollars, the shonky tenderer could then go to court, get the court to bring down a decision that the correct legal interpretation of the determination was a singular licence not plural and then the court could allocate that licence to the shonky tenderer for $20. Therefore that would upset the proper tender process and cost the public the million dollars it should have got for the licence, but further it could open up a potential legal challenge for damages from the failed genuine tenderer, tenderer Y, who put in a bid for a million dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that that situation was described to me, I think, accurately as being very remote. When I first had this brought to my attention by officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Transport and Communications, the two courses of action that were being considered at that stage&mdash;and, I might add, strongly argued among the lawyers concerned because this is a very arcane legal problem as anyone who takes the trouble to read the advices and look at these determinations will see&mdash;were to continue the process because of the acknowledged small risk of the problem ever occurring or to legislate to correct it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For people who want to be concerned about the prospect of legislating, I refer them to Mr Gyles's advice because this is covered there quite well. The problem with legislation is that it would have been an incredibly complicated matter to construct legislation that would have covered off, retrospectively validated the determinations and taken into account as well the effect of the court order in Perth on all of those determinations. In other words, that is a complicated exercise. Of course, the more complicated it would have been the higher the risk would have been that, despite the most extreme care devoted to it, we would still get it wrong. Those two options were the ones that were being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the matter then went off for private legal advice for the first time and after a great deal of consideration by Mr Gyles, the third option of abrogation emerged as being the surest way of guaranteeing the process that we could possibly adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear to me very early on that this was a matter that I responsibly had to take to Cabinet, particularly as the level of risk involved&mdash;this can be seen if one reads Mr Gyles's advice&mdash;between those options of legislating and abrogating was something that indeed Cabinet could have had a different view on. One of the potential outcomes would have been, and could have been, that Cabinet asked me to further consider and explore the question of legislation rather than abrogation. I would have understood that to be a reasonable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the circumstances, and knowing the Attorney-General's advice was similar at the end of day to Mr Gyles's advice&mdash;and I believe it was the correct option&mdash;I determined that the matter should go to Cabinet. I asked for the matter to be prepared as a draft submission to Cabinet, with all of the legal advice attached and all the options laid out as is normal in a Cabinet submission, that is the background and the pros and cons of the three options that were being considered and all the legal advice attached to it as a draft Cabinet submission. That was delivered to my office sometime on Thursday. Honourable senators would recall&mdash;Senator Bourne and Senator Alston will certainly recall&mdash;that on that day we were successfully getting through both Houses of Parliament legislation to ensure that the central policy intent of this Senate chamber, as I have said many times, of getting a nationally delivered satellite service with an ancillary service for MDS applied, was being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston knows full well that that process did not conclude until about 2 o'clock in the morning in the House of Representatives. I was physically in the House of Representatives anterooms at that point in time and reliable advice tells me&mdash;with the best intentions in the world&mdash;that Senator Alston was over there as well. At about 2 o'clock both Bills had successfully passed through both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went back to my office at half past two on Friday morning&mdash;and I might tell the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that I do not do this out of choice; it is just because when the job is there to do, one has to do it&mdash;and dealt with the ministerials of the day. There were about 50 of them at that stage. I did not get to the other 49. The chief one was the draft Cabinet submission. At that point in time I did not even bother to read the background and the options papers&mdash;I went straight to Gyles's advice and I read it. By about half past three or 4 o'clock I said to my staff, `Look, it is just not possible for me to do this. This is so complicated and so delicately balanced, I should not consider this until I have had at least a few hours sleep'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday, I carefully read the entire draft Cabinet submission. It was my view that it should in fact go to Cabinet and had to go to Cabinet. And it was also my view that the recommendation I would take to Cabinet was abrogation, despite the obvious difficulties of that course of action. It provided the surest way of ensuring, for the genuine bidders, that the process would not be upset by this obscure possibility, this remote possibility, that some shonky bidder could exploit this.

I ask Senator Alston to name another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was made obvious to me a fortnight ago, I acted instantly. I asked the secretary to the department to conduct a complete, immediate investigation which has since been overtaken by an independent inquirer, the former Commonwealth ombudsman. And I am getting a little tired of comments being made about that because those comments are really based on nothing but false assumptions. The secretary advised me that that process was already under way. A scrupulous re-examination was made of all the tender documents, including, I might add, even such things as tenders for the acquisition of computers by the department. The results of that examination show that this is the problem which has been revealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the question asked by Senator Alston, this is where people should simply refer to Mr Evans's letter. The fact of the matter is that some time in February&mdash;early February, I am told&mdash;there was an indication that there was a drafting difficulty. At that time, my then adviser, Mr Meagher&mdash;who is now back working for Senator Richardson&mdash;had some general knowledge that a drafting technicality had been discovered. It was placed no higher than that. The department expected that technicality would be resolved in the court action because it had strong legal advice&mdash;written advice&mdash;that the court action would be successful and that the technicality could then be addressed. That was the full extent of the advice which was given. I bring it to the attention of Senator Alston that that is why Mr Evans took the action which he did. </PARA>
<PARA>     As I said, on about 19 or 22 February the department received written advice from the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;this was well and truly after the Federal election was announced on 7 February&mdash;saying that there was a problem in terms of the drafting. That was made available to the department. No further advice was received either by my office or myself on the matter because it was simply assumed that it would be corrected by the court action. The court action did not validate the revocation but what the court action did&mdash;and I read it out this morning&mdash;was to issue an order following agreement between the Commonwealth's lawyers and Mr Stokes's lawyers, who met the morning before the court case and formed an agreement which was satisfactory to both us and them. I have quoted this but I will quote it again. The court directed the Government to `accept and treat as valid any tender or revised tender complying with a ministerial direction under which the tender process was conducted'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was determined by the legal advice of the department then that that provided a valid basis for the tender process to proceed with the agreement of all parties. The advice given to me from Perth was that we had a valid basis on which the tender process could proceed. I was advised in writing on 8 April that the order&mdash;that is, the order from the court&mdash;`enables the MDS tender process to be completed under the existing ministerial determination'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, pay TV, another day, another disaster! Last Thursday the Australian Democrats overhauled the pay TV legislation and finally put into place what we hope is a workable system with clear deadlines for the commencement of pay TV services. The cancellation and restarting of the microwave tender process does not really change public perception, and it will probably have no effect on the pay TV services which Australians should start to receive in the middle of next year. What it does do&mdash;this is pretty obvious to everyone&mdash;is yet again snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. It is a reinforcement of the public perception of total chaos just when some order seemed to be just around the corner in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that we are debating this MPI today is that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) has just exercised the authority and control which the MPI says he has not exercised in restarting the microwave licence tender process. However, the Minister has been unable to prevent a series of extraordinary blunders from derailing and discrediting the tender process for both satellite and microwave licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This MPI sheets the blame firmly home to the Minister. The Opposition has consistently based its attack on Senator Collins on the doctrine of ministerial responsibility.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats strongly believe in the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, but it seems to us that our definition differs from that of the coalition. To the coalition, ministerial responsibility seems to mean that the Minister takes the blame for every mistake made within his department and resigns. This definition is motivated solely by the desire&mdash;understandable in an opposition&mdash;to undermine the Government and create a sense of chaos for as long as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not what we are after. To the Democrats, ministerial responsibility means at least three things: if the Minister makes a mistake that he had enough information to avoid, the ball is squarely in his court and if the mistake is serious enough, he should resign; if the department makes a mistake, the Minister's responsibility is to rectify it quickly and very openly; and if the department makes a series of mistakes which run counter to the laws passed by this Parliament, it is the responsibility of the Minister, and the Parliament if need be, to take a long hard look at that department and try to fix the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first point, it is premature to pass judgment on the Minister's future. We need to see Professor Pearce's report into the satellite tenders. We need to look at all the documents on the microwave tender process, including documents on this latest instalment of the fiasco. We will decide on that when we have seen the evidence, and I hope that will be soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second point, the Democrats believe that the department has made a number of mistakes and, as far as we know, the Minister has acted to correct those. Notwithstanding this latest fiasco, our amendments of last Thursday have brought some certainty to the pay TV regime. That is certainly the message we are getting from the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the third point, the Democrats do not believe that the Minister has come to terms with the fact that his department is running a deregulatory policy line&mdash;a dry agenda which contradicts the legislation passed by this Parliament. It has been clear for quite some time that the Department of Transport and Communications is not interested in establishing a regulatory environment which promotes media diversity, but it is not alone in that. We cannot see too much evidence that either the Government or the Opposition is too keen on media diversity either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our information from industry sources is that the Department of Transport and Communications has shown precious little interest in policies which further develop the Australian media and electronics industries, including pay TV. The strong impression we get from the Minister's trials is that he has to fight his department to get any public interest criteria inserted in almost any legislation. We are not suggesting that the department should fail in its duty to give robust advice, even if it suspects that that advice will be rejected. Of course it should give the best advice it has. However, when it is clear that a certain policy framework has been set by the Parliament and the Government, the department must work within that framework. There is a strong suspicion in many quarters, and has been for some time, that this department has failed to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department's dry agenda may be characterised as follows: it has a strong preference for voluntary codes of conduct which cannot be enforced and can be flouted with impunity; it has a distinct lack of interest in rigorous restrictions on cross-media and foreign ownership and on ownership concentration within media sectors; it has an unwillingness to design policies which promote local media production and local manufacturing of communications equipment; and it certainly seems to have a general hostility towards the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to pay TV, it is beyond doubt that the department did draft legislation which gave microwave a head start over satellite and that that was contrary to public interest and the stated intention of the Parliament and the Government. The department also made two mistakes in tender documents and one of them was very serious. The question is: has the department been faithfully executing government policy all along? If so, it is appalling policy. In any case, the Senate will be getting plenty of evidence on which to judge the Minister by other means. The Senate will receive documents from the Minister relating to all these occurrences over the next week. We want to study those documents and form an opinion after that. What we are saying is, let us see the evidence before we pass that judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year in the second reading debate on this Bill I said that I had just been reading a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dished</EMPHASIS> about the absolute fiasco of the British pay TV introduction.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now see the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), for the third time in but a few months, engaged in a furore with regard to the tendering process for pay television. Firstly, we saw the problem relating to the abandonment of the tendering process for microwave television services or MDS. That process was abandoned because it suddenly became apparent that microwave systems could be used for the delivery of pay television on a broad scale. Prior to that, the Minister had claimed that MDS was never intended to be used for broadcasting pay television. The lie to that claim is given by the fact that in November 1992 the Minister said that microwave services were likely to broadcast the first pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1992, in the Senate debate on the legislation relating to pay television, the Minister also said that it was important to note that there would be no restriction on the use of other technologies to deliver pay television, such as cable or microwave, and that they will be licensed under section 96. He said earlier that technological neutrality of government legislation would ensure that licensees would be encouraged to use whichever delivery mechanism suited their commercial needs. That first fiasco revealed the incompetence of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently we have seen the fiasco regarding pay television as delivered by satellite, with the tendering process failing to require any sort of deposit from the successful tenderers; therefore, the process was not able to guarantee that the successful tenderers would be able to deliver the goods and deliver a pay television service by satellite. Today we are back to the issue of microwave pay TV and the technical deficiencies which have been revealed in the earlier tender process which resulted in the offer by the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications to stand down&mdash;an offer which was rejected by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Relevant to all of these fiascos is the performance of this Minister. He has been responsible for the department throughout this period. It is not only with regard to pay television that we have seen fiascos occur under this Minister's administration of the department; earlier we saw the problems with the tendering process for the provisions relating to air traffic control. Prior to that, on the Minister's appointment as Minister for Shipping and Aviation, responsible for the waterfront, we heard his commitment that he would resign if he did not obtain reforms on the waterfront as quickly as he desired. Those reforms were not obtained at the speed the Minister had indicated they would be, but of course we did not see the Minister resign&mdash;we simply saw him promoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the time he has been a Minister&mdash;from his previous portfolio to his administration of the present department&mdash;we have seen difficulties and problems which indicate quite clearly his failure to adequately perform his ministerial duties and his incapacity to manage the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that this department has for a long time had a reputation of pleasing itself and going its own way as far as policy direction is concerned. We are also led to understand&mdash;indeed, the Minister confirmed it again in his remarks to us today&mdash;that the Department of Transport and Communications is a highly competent department. The Minister indicated that in his remarks a few moments ago. He also made that claim in answer to questions directed to him at estimates committee hearings last week. I also understand that this department has been praised for its administrative competence by no less a body than the Institute of Public Administration in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those pieces of evidence indicate that this is a competent department. So we have to ask ourselves: why have these particular fiascos arisen? Are they simply errors or mistakes that the department has made, as I said here in debate last week, or are they in fact deliberate and calculated decisions the department has taken which subsequently have caused political difficulties for the Government and this Minister which they have then had to take action to attempt to overcome by legislation, by inquiries into the department and by all of the experiences of the past week or so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given those facts, it is all the more reason why the Minister ought to be taking particular interest in the activities of his department. If it is competent but has this reputation for going its own way, for taking its own initiative on policy direction and issues, then it is absolutely critical that this Minister&mdash;having, we assume, been aware of that&mdash;be across his department and be especially careful about what the department is putting before him. Of course, this has not happened. Neither the Minister nor his personal staff has taken adequate interest in what the department has been doing. Of course, that is at the centre of this matter of public importance debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is the person directly responsible for the future of pay television in Australia and he has failed in that responsibility. Therefore, consistent with that failure, the Minister ought to stand aside pending further investigations and inquiries into this particular issue. It is clear, as the terms of the matter raised by my colleague Senator Alston this afternoon indicate, that there has been a `continuing failure by the Minister for Transport and Communications to exercise any authority or control over the pay television tender processes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Minister has failed to do that, we need to ask: who in fact has been exercising that control? As I said a few moments ago, the department has a reputation for going its own way, but it is hard to believe that even this department&mdash;if it were acting in its usual highly regarded, competent way&mdash;would put forward proposals that would lead to its Minister and itself being subject to such criticism. It simply does not make sense that it would be putting forward these sorts of proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it suddenly making decisions, which the Government and the Minister have come to regard as errors, on such an important issue&mdash;an issue which is not only important to the future of pay television and the potential consumers of that service, but is indeed also important as a political issue? Why has it apparently made such a mess of what are relatively simple issues? These are not difficult issues to determine. They are relatively straightforward and simple issues, yet we see the fiasco that has resulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only therefore conclude that the department is getting conflicting advice or interference from elsewhere and that it is not the Minister who is exercising authority or control over the department with regard to this issue but that it is in fact someone else. We need to ask: who is that someone else? Is it the Prime Minister? Is Mr Keating seeking to look after his mates in the industry by putting forward proposals that may in fact assist them, as was clearly evident at the time of the termination of the original tender process for microwave television?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing is clearer than that the Prime Minister directly interfered in that microwave tendering process to benefit his mates in the media industry when he discovered that microwave technology could be used for the widespread delivery of pay television services. He did not want Mr Cosser to have the advantage of being able to deliver those services; he wanted that reserved for some of his mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads us to the conclusion that it is not this Minister who is exercising authority and control over the pay television tender process and over his department in that process, as is his responsibility as a Minister. It is another Minister, the Prime Minister, who is interfering and intervening, perhaps even contrary to what this Minister would like to achieve in that regard. That really is the source of this problem. If this Minister is going to exercise his responsibility, it is up to him to tell the Prime Minister to shove it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a great pity because the problems that have resulted from the Government's handling of this issue have been absolutely incredible. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 13 May 1993 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's handling of pay TV affair has seriously hurt investor interest in Australia with all but a few players abandoning their business plans according to senior broadcasting industry representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Industry representatives have been reported as saying that several major international broadcasting companies had expressed an interest in developing pay TV in Australia but that that interest has largely evaporated. The Government's backflip on microwave pay TV and the controversy over the satellite pay TV tendering process have been largely the cause of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to last week's reports, only a handful of international players have retained an interest in pay TV; the rest have dropped out. This was the situation before the latest debacle in the long and sorry saga of this Government's pay TV policy. We can safely assume that what little international investment interest remains has been almost completely eliminated due to the disaster with the MDS tendering processes which have just been proved to be legally invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that Australia has been made the laughing stock of the international investment community, we have to ask who is responsible. The logical answer to this question is the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins. But, in an unprecedented abrogation of ministerial responsibility under the Westminster system, the Minister has failed not only to accept responsibility for the debacle but also to properly answer the many questions asked of him on this issue. In fact, he has attempted to palm off the responsibility for Australia's pay TV nightmare onto the public servants in his department. Unfortunately for the Minister, however, this really does not wash. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the amazing decision, based on what happened in January, to call off bidding for the MDS pay TV licences the day before the tenders were due to close. At this point it was clear that the Minister was not exercising authority over the tendering process for MDS pay TV licences. He claimed to be ignorant of the potential of MDS technology to provide a comprehensive pay TV service, despite meetings between departmental officials and representatives of Mr Steve Cosser, who had a clear intention of pursuing broadcast services using MDS technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, in order to reach the decision to call off the MDS tendering process, the Prime Minister had to intervene with the Department of Transport and Communications. Surely this is a clear indication that Senator Collins was not exercising proper authority and control over the tendering processes being run by his department. This is especially the case, given that the Prime Minister felt the department had notoriously misled the Cabinet on the extent to which MDS might be used for pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins was not keeping up with what his department was doing, or what it knew. This is, of course, if we accept the claim of Senator Collins that he was ignorant of the potential of MDS. It would seem extraordinary that the Minister was not aware of the capabilities of MDS technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Cosser's intentions seemed clear. There have been numerous claims that industry representatives had discussed the issue with both the Department of Transport and Communications and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Someone is not being completely truthful and we have yet to discover who. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that the Minister was not aware of the potential of MDS technology, and he should have been. If the department was aware of that potential and it did not inform the Minister of this, as it should have, the implication is that the Minister is not exercising enough authority within his department. Subsequent to the decision being made to call off the tendering process for MDS, it came to light that the decision was in conflict with the objectives of the broadcasting Act. Therefore, legislation was necessary to give effect to the Minister's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is yet another example of a government making decisions with regard to pay TV without properly looking at all the implications of the action. Additionally, the inevitable legal action followed with both Kerry Stokes and Steve Cosser launching legal proceedings for misleading and deceptive conduct in regard to the MDS tendering process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason given by the Minister for abandoning MDS tendering was to stop `inferior technology' from coming onto the market. This conflicts with the original intention of the government legislation being technologically neutral and flies in the face of plans which were clearly under way to establish a broadcast pay TV service through MDS technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even Senator Richardson noted on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hinch</EMPHASIS> program on 22 February that the Government `had a problem' when it realised that pay TV could not be provided by MDS to most of Melbourne and 70 per cent of Sydney. Not surprisingly, in March this year the Federal Court ruled that the Government had invalidly terminated the tender process for MDS pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government then offered an additional explanation for its decision on MDS technology and that was that satellite technology was the preferred option of the Government. This appears to contradict its original claims of the desirability of technologically neutral legislation governing the pay TV industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then discovered yesterday that the reopened MDS tendering process, which only had 10 days to go before tenders closed, would have to be abandoned because the process was, according to Mr Roger Gyles QC, `invalid and of no effect in law'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the secretary of the department became aware of these technical difficulties during the preparation of the case for the Federal Court proceedings some months before.

If this is not enough to show that the Minister has lost control and seems to have no authority over his department, we can look at the other side of the pay TV debacle, that of the tendering process for satellite pay TV licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tenders for satellite licences closed on 28 April 1993, with speculation that the winning bids would be between $50 million and $80 million. The Government announced, however, that the winning bids came from UCOM and Hi Vision, with bids of $177 million and $212 million. It was immediately apparent that these successful applicants would have great difficulty in raising the huge amounts of money that they had bid. The tendering process had obviously been a farce. There was no requirement for a five per cent deposit in the tendering process, a requirement common to the MDS process and tendering for the third mobile telecommunication licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister claimed that the change in policy to omit the requirement for a five per cent deposit was not pointed out to him by the department and that, therefore, he cannot be held responsible for the joke that the tendering process has become. The Minister then changed the tendering process so that, if UCOM and Hi Vision fail to finance their bids, the next highest bidder will have to find the five per cent deposit within three days of being advised it is in the running for a licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been described as unprecedented and heinous legislation, retrospectively changing the rules for a tender halfway through the bidding process. This also fails to address the other problem within the bidding process, that of multiple collapsing bids. It would appear that the department had been informed of the possibility of multiple bids but, again, it remains a mystery as to why the department failed to act to prevent this. It also remains to be seen why the Minister was not informed of the possibility of these bids and why he failed to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is clearly that the Minister does not have control over his department. He has not exercised any authority or control over the tendering processes for pay TV licences. His department is not briefing him properly, and the Minister has not shown any desire to be briefed properly. The Minister is signing determinations and authorisations without having all the facts or, indeed, understanding what he is signing. That is a neglect of responsibility which he must accept, and his failure to do so is a disgrace. Like his senior public servants who have offered to do the right thing, he should stand aside.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Alexis de Tocqueville once wrote of the American republic in its infancy that the final frontier would be the courts. Had de Tocqueville toured Australia at a similar time, in the 1830s, I am sure he would have been astute enough to write that of the early Australian colonies; indeed, it could have been written at the turn of this century about the infant Commonwealth of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final frontier in our political system now is undoubtedly the Australian judiciary. We really need to take that into consideration whenever we deal with legislation and matters of public policy. That is what is at the core of the debate this afternoon&mdash;whether the Parliament will be cognisant of the legal ramifications of what it does, not only in terms of legislation but also in terms of delegated authority over legislation. At all times we need to guard against making the Commonwealth liable to litigation, vulnerable to rebuffs in the courts and rejection of legislation in the courts or, equally, determinations being made by the courts that are at variance with public policy as set down by the Parliament of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to look momentarily at the Opposition's matter of public importance. It really is a repeat of a matter which the chamber debated a fortnight or so ago. That proposition had absolutely no impact upon public policy whatsoever; it had no impact upon the political process whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon we have had a repeat performance. Again, the Opposition has failed to display any sense of originality of purpose. It is unable to cite a single example of wrongdoing at any level of the department or at any level of the Government. There is no evidence of ministerial failure apparent in the debate. Nothing has emerged at Question Time, nothing has emerged during the course of the debates and nothing untoward has been discovered in the process whatsoever. That leads me to conclude, not unreasonably, that the proposition before the chamber again this afternoon takes us nowhere. Justice could have been put in train a fortnight ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Collins made clear in his earlier remarks, Senator Alston is again endeavouring to make bricks without straw and, as in biblical times, that is an impossibility. He is not even endeavouring to achieve that hopeless end very successfully. All that we have seen this afternoon is a series of unbelievable assertions. This brings me to the observation that the current state of the coalition is very reminiscent of the Australian Labor Party after the 1961 general election. We had suffered a string of losses and had been defeated in a general election that we ought to have won. That was an election that the ALP ought not to have lost under Mr Calwell. There is no question that in our history we had a front bench that was devoid of strategy, just as exists in the coalition now. We had a party that for a time appeared to be devoid of hope, just as exists in the coalition now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just as the ALP in 1961 faced a decade in continuing opposition, so does Senator MacGibbon and the coalition now. We have just had another decade of frustration where members of the coalition can give vent to phobias, frustrations and obsessions. Quite frankly, as everybody in the political process in the country knows, the coalition effectively denied itself the right to govern. It denied itself the capacity to experience the dilemmas, the challenges, the pressures and demands of government and to understand and appreciate the complexities. Every MPI we see in this chamber demonstrates vividly and graphically the fact that there is virtually no experience of the government process whatsoever in those opposite. We are happy in government to let the coalition sit in comfortable impotence, perhaps for a decade or perhaps for an even longer time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon we are really talking about arcane legal technicalities where singular may or may not mean plural. As Senator Collins made clear, had he not acted in the manner in which he did, with total ministerial propriety, the process could have been, unlikely or in a remote sense, open to abuse. It could have been open to manipulation or it could have been open to the unscrupulous. That may well have meant that it was open to litigation. We had the experience of the arguments, the long legal debates and the long legal charges and countercharges in Perth over the issue of the FM licence which took some two years and cost millions of dollars. We certainly do not want to see a repeat experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, broadcasting legislation and the broadcasting industry in this country, rightly or wrongly, for good or ill, has really become a lawyers' springtime and everyone is aware of that. Certainly everyone in the ranks of government is aware of that. The court may have had no choice but to award a licence to the unscrupulous&mdash;a remote possibility, but a possibility nonetheless&mdash;had Senator Collins not acted in the way that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the point of ministerial propriety. The Minister acted properly wherever there was an obligation to exercise ministerial discretion or authority. I do not believe that is in doubt. It is not possible in every situation for legislation to cover all the circumstances, particularly all the circumstances in the light of court rulings. It is impossible for legislation to anticipate every eventuality. But what we have seen time and again when the process has been subject to examination and scrutiny is that Minister Collins acted responsibly on the basis of advice, particularly on the basis of the advice from Mr Roger Gyles QC, as well as on the basis of advice from the Attorney-General's Department. Again, the process could not have been more straightforward, open and honest. A Cabinet determination was sought and the Minister acted to take matters to Cabinet, to lay out the legal advice and the available options. Again, he did nothing untoward in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about dealing with matters sometimes in the small hours of the morning when complexities are compounded by fatigue. But, again, Minister Collins acted properly. There is no suggestion to the contrary. Maybe the option of a realignment or restructuring in the department needs to be looked at and canvassed at some appropriate stage during the life of this Government or at a time subsequent to the next general election. We have a vast bureaucracy here  dealing with a vast number of complex, technical areas&mdash;a multitude of complex issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this afternoon we can say with absolute certainty that when the Minister knew of the problems he acted. I have not heard anyone argue that to the contrary&mdash;not from any of the backgrounding of certain elements of the media and not from anything that has been said in the chamber. I take aboard the Minister's remarks earlier today about the number of Ministers who have occupied the portfolio. I thought that was a valid observation so far as the democratic process is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal very briefly with the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 17 May. I think it is worth noting in the chamber the manner in which the Prime Minister sets out the passage of events and makes some pertinent observations. There is no doubt that Mr Graham Evans also acted with total and complete propriety. His judgment was understandable given the circumstances of the general election. There is no doubt that the legal advice, as the Prime Minister makes clear, could be understood by a layman. As a matter of fact, I think that legal advice puts that matter beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put on the record in the Senate this afternoon that I have worked with Mr Evans over a long period in different capacities and in different policy areas. He is a man of very great ability and integrity, and I have never known him to act other than with total application, total propriety and a great deal of skill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is worth while noting that the Prime Minister's letter&mdash;I intend to quote it&mdash;sets out in some detail the achievements of the Department of Transport and Communications over time. The Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major legislative reforms have been implemented covering broadcasting and radiocommunications, and telecommunications and aviation have been opened up to competition with substantial benefits to consumers. The vexed question of the third runway at Sydney airport was dealt with and construction is underway. The Department has supported the reforms of shipping and the waterfront and it has been responsible for establishing new national bodies for the reform of rail freight and road transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of that can be denied. When I first came into Labor politics in the 1960s the most vexed question facing the district in which I grew up, St George, was that of Sydney airport and the runway extensions. That problem alone, having been solved, is a great credit to the department. I think the Prime Minister has really put matters in a proper context and a proper perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to Senator Bourne's remarks. She normally makes a thoughtful contribution. That could be said again of her contribution this afternoon. Nothing that Senator Bourne said in detail about ministerial responsibility could possibly suggest to anyone that Senator Collins ought to stand down. Nothing that Senator Bourne outlined, and I think it was a fair outline, as to the doctrine of ministerial responsibility could possibly suggest that Senator Collins ought to stand down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to my friend Senator Cooney, who gave another outstanding performance in the chamber. As Senator Cooney made clear, the Opposition is endeavouring to set an absolutely ridiculous standard&mdash;a standard which has no application in the real world, which has no application in government and which has no point of reference to the requirements of actual government of the Commonwealth of Australia. All the media coverage has indicated to date that all the coalition is about is trying to score the very shortest term gain possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition makes no contribution to public policy. It has no impact upon the political process and has no objective beyond giving Minister Collins a difficult time for two hours of an afternoon. What is the point of that? Surely people opposite can learn from the fact that after 10 or 11 years the Australian people do not respect that. They look for alternatives in public policy. What have we had today? We have had no perspective from those opposite on MDS, broadcasting or pay TV in the most general sense of the term. All we have had is just a little flak which we have had to deflect over a couple of hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the question in hand. As Senator Cooney made clear, there is no evidence of dishonesty or impropriety. There is no suggestion that the Minister did anything other than follow the appropriate advice in detail and to the letter. In that respect, I draw attention particularly to the advice of 12 May 1993&mdash;followed to the letter. In every instance where it may be suggested, even remotely, that a flaw or a vulnerability existed in the Commonwealth's objectives, the Minister acted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon we do not have before us any attempt to find a resolution. Senator Collins has not misled the Parliament; he has not misled the Cabinet; he has not misled the public. He has been open, honest and forthright in all his dealings with the chamber. Walter Lippman once made the observation that a democratic society cannot function without a capacity to detect lies. That is true. It was true of the United States; it is certainly true of the rest of North America and of western Europe; and it is certainly true of our own political system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that the coalition has this afternoon is that no lies have been told. We have mechanisms to detect lies which, though not perfect, are very effective: we have the Parliament, we have the media and we have opinion. But no lies have been told. There is not a single example of dishonesty. Nowhere has that been suggested. All we have, as Senator Tierney made clear, is a series of phobias and obsessions from those opposite in the area of the media. It is impossible for the coalition to talk about media without talking about the mates. This is extraordinary. If people knew the kinds of tensions that exist from time to time between government and some of the significant media players, they would dismiss that kind of nonsense for what it is: an obsession on the part of the Liberal and National parties. No lies have been detected because no lies have been told. None have even been suggested. For that reason alone, the Senate should not agree to this proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;During Question Time today Senator Tierney referred to a debate in which I had participated in the Northern Territory Parliament nine years ago.

Senator Tierney quoted what I had said about ministerial responsibility in relation to a memo, which I correctly recalled had been signed by the then Minister for Housing, Mr Dondas, currently the Speaker of the Northern Territory Parliament, and asserted that the comments I had made about ministerial responsibility in terms of this memo did not relate to the memo.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have the documents. I must give credit for this to the Clerk of the Northern Territory Parliament, a former officer of this Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The memo, as you will see when you read it, Mr Acting Deputy President, offered to relieve the Minister of his discretion in waiving interest penalty payments from public servants who had bought their own houses, to relieve the Minister of the problem of `the irritation to you of signing instruments on an almost daily basis'. What the memo went on to say was astonishing. I suggest to Senator Alston and some of his colleagues that they read this, because the Minister did not actually resign. In the final paragraph the memo said, `Whilst not strictly in accord with the letter of the Act . . .'. The Minister's department gave him a memo which proposed relieving the Minister of all of his discretion and having it exercised by the department&mdash;and this was a brand new Act of parliament that had only just been passed. </PARA>

He is now retired and I would like to put on record in public the service that he gave the Commonwealth through the not terribly long period in which he was chief defence scientist. He fulfilled that role with distinction. I wish every success to the new chief defence scientist in his task, Dr Brabin-Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal report deals with the commercial activities, the balance sheet, for the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. I have no quarrel at all with getting a return from the research work done by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation because it is a very big body and a very expensive body for the Australian taxpayer. Not too many people know that it is second in size as a research and development organisation only to CSIRO. As I say, there is no quarrel at all about getting a commercial return from that if it is possible because it is a very big national resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a bit uneasy at some of the public statements that have emanated from the two preceding Ministers responsible for this&mdash;Minister Kelly and Minister Bilney&mdash;because they have tended to portray DSTO as a cornucopia of money that is just there to be plucked, a virtual licence to print money. Some of the statements they have made are more adulatory of their own cleverness at finding that there is a source of money there to be tapped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of balance. Of course there are civilian applications for some things that are done purely for defence purposes and the taxpayer and the nation should get any commercial benefit coming from the application of that research. But the basic point seems to me to be often overlooked: the Defence Science and Technology Organisation exists only because what it is tasked to do is not being done by civilian or private industry, for very good reasons. The basic role of DSTO is to do that research which is not being done and which is essential to support the defence of Australia and national security. As I say, it is a matter of balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in the United Kingdom recently. I believe it has changed its equivalent body into being a purely contractual research body. I think if that happens there is only limited value in having something like the DSTO. We cannot measure the success of the DSTO in terms of a balance sheet. Many of its greatest achievements would not be recognised until we got into a defence emergency and in that case it would be quite impossible to ascribe a financial value to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome this report because it shows that people are thinking about the balance that is required in this area. Some of the points raised in the report revolve around the amount of effort that goes into setting up the sales organisation, preparation of the product for sale, and whether it is intellectual property, patents, hardware or software. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report raises a number of points about the analysis, the need to identify and analyse cost overruns that were not always performed, the shortcomings in reviewing overhead rates and things like that, because it is always difficult in a big research body to specifically ascribe some of those overhead costs to a project and recover them from the client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scale of the profit reported here is only $184,452, which in the context of the commercial world is really quite small. It reinforces the need for balance. If all this work is being put into commercialisation we would hope that we would have a bigger return from it. I would also hope that the profits from the commercialisation would be retained by the DSTO without prejudice to its present budget. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included in this report are: details of the honey research levy; the role and objectives of the Honeybee Research and Development Council; and details of research strategies and priorities. Matters relating to nutrition and disease are detailed on pages 15 and 16 of this report. Then there is information regarding resource management and the value of the industry. I was very interested in that section of the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resource base for honeybees is being eroded for a number of distinct and unrelated causes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. deliberate clearing of forested country for other agricultural purposes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. clear felling for pine or other timber production or for woodchipping;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.control of plants useful to beekeepers by biological or other means;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. rural dieback and the absence of adequate regeneration of nectar/pollen trees in rural Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The terrible drought we are having in Queensland and New South Wales would be very detrimental to beekeepers. The report then talks about:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the conversion of Crown land to reserves or National Park status combined with an increasing tendency by land managers to exclude beekeepers from servicing traditional apiary sites in these classified areas.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Council fully recognises the problems posed to beekeepers by the significant loss of useful nectar and pollen sources and acknowledges that this problem is likely to be exacerbated by competing demands on these areas, and by increasing pressures from the conservation lobby for the exclusion of all exotic flora and fauna from reserves and National Parks. The loss or potential loss of traditional nectar and pollen sources has been identified as the single major problem confronting the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Undoubtedly, this would be a concern. We have to be very careful that the conservation lobby does not harm our rural industries in so many areas. That does not apply only to the honey industry; it can also apply to kangaroos. There is a concern about conserving kangaroos, but it is not realised that so many kangaroos in Australia eat up valuable grass where there is still some grass. In the early days not too many people had water supplies, and the more water was supplied, the more kangaroos seemed to hang around. At one stage my son John had a tremendous number of kangaroos and emus on his property in central Queensland, but a terrible flood a couple of years ago stopped the problems that he was having. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to most established bee sites on public lands is assured in the short term in all States at the present time but no State has any guarantee of future access, so the report says. The report also says that there is continued expansion of national parks, wilderness areas, World Heritage areas and special parks. This is probably not helping the beekeepers, who need to be assured of places where bees can be placed for the production of honey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of years ago at home at Kingaroy we grew kiwi fruit, and we always had to bring hives of bees from various places so that they could pollinate the plants.

I do congratulate the Honeybee Research and Development Council for the work that it is doing to try to ensure that the beekeepers in Australia have areas that are satisfactory for the bees to gather honey from. </PARA>

But what the report does not show is that in 1991, for which the figures are still to come, the prices will be down and the overall results will not be as favourable as they were the previous year. The expectation for the 1992 season was for 102,853 tonnes of combined fruits, but for 1992-93 it was expected to be only about 50,000 tonnes because of bad weather, stress on the grapes and problems overseas. There is also a large carryover of about 60,000 or 70,000 tonnes from the previous year. So marketing will be a little bit difficult for this industry this year in comparison with the last year or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia consumes nearly 30,000 tonnes per year and our exports total about 45,000 tonnes a year. That puts us into fairly good company with the other producing countries of the world. We export to many countries, 21 of which import over 100 tonnes a year. Our biggest markets are Germany, to which we export about 18,000 tonnes; Canada, about 11,000 tonnes; Great Britain, about 8,000 tonnes; and New Zealand, about 5,000 tonnes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a pleasure to follow Senator Archer on this particular issue as I know that he has done a lot of work over the years in relation to dried fruits. I want to speak on one very small part of the report of the Australian Dried Fruits Board, and refer to the comments on page 9 in relation to the cost of shipping. Senator Archer has tried on numerous occasions to obtain from Senator Collins an indication of who has supposedly received the benefits of this waterfront reform we are hearing about all the time. We never cease to hear from the other side of the chamber in Question Time&mdash;day in, day out&mdash;about the so-called benefits of waterfront reform. But this is what one of the users of the waterfront has had to say. The Australian Dried Fruits Board annual report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . freight rates to Canada and New Zealand remain relatively high making these markets costly to service. With the continuing highly competitive nature of the international dried fruits industry and the proximity of Australia's competitors to the major markets, freight movements and reliability of shipping services will have a continuing effect on growers' returns and ultimately on the ability of the Australian Industry to export.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Archer has already said, we have seen that there has been very little change in the cost of loading a 20-foot container in Melbourne, from which most of the container trade goes out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report says that unless the users of the freight services start to get some of the benefits of this waterfront reform, we are not going to be selling into these markets. Canada, one of our larger export markets, is right next door to the United States of America. It has substantially lower transport costs than we have in getting its produce to market. That $91.95 charge in the 1992 year was not the cost of transporting the container; it was the cost of loading the container in Melbourne. Added to that, of course, is the cost of actually transporting it from Melbourne to the port where it will be disembarked. So there is not only that cost, but all the other transport costs on top. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board is clearly saying that the Government has to get serious about waterfront reform. It makes it very clear that the cost of waterfront reform is not just something that gets passed around and we all put the hat in for the wharfies, but that waterfront reform should be about giving businesses a chance to enjoy the benefits of what they produce. Every extra dollar that we have to pay on the waterfront is a dollar that comes out of the pockets of a farmer who has produced this good. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report speaks eloquent tomes in just those few simple paragraphs of the need for the benefits of waterfront reform&mdash;if there has been any waterfront reform&mdash;to be passed on. We cannot have a situation where farmers get a fairly low net return on their production, yet huge amounts are extracted in the process by people who do very little. It is quite absurd&mdash;Senator Panizza is shaking his head&mdash;that it would cost $91.95 to pick up a container off the wharf and put it on a ship and load it. It is not worth $91.95 to do that, especially when one considers the net return the farmers get for all the work they do throughout the entire season. I am saying, and the report is saying, that there is something very inequitable happening in Australia at the moment: the people who produce the real wealth are not getting a decent enough return on their hard efforts and hard labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely critical that the Government really starts to get serious about waterfront reform. Senator Collins should start to answer some of the questions that Senator Archer has been putting to him so that we can ensure that the good people who are the backbone of this industry start to get their fair share of the money for the hard work and investment they put in. It is a great industry and this Government should not stand in the way of efforts to ensure that those people get a decent return for their work. </PARA>

<PARA>Report No. 32 of 1992-93, which is an efficiency audit by the Auditor-General into the implementation of an interim greenhouse response, is quite damning in its criticism of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Once again, we have to decide who was responsible for the action&mdash;or is it in this case the inaction?&mdash;of a department. Is the concept of ministerial responsibility still alive and well in Australia? It appears not from what we have seen so far in the Department of Transport and Communications, but now we have a matter of gross dereliction of ministerial duty in failing to establish that the department was carrying out government policy. I do not know whether the Minister will regard himself as not bound by the old principle of ministerial responsibility. He has not been sacked, stood down, suspended or criticised by his Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether this will just be another of those instances where a Minister has presided over what is clear incompetence without suffering any of the normal consequences that have flowed under the Westminster system in the past from that kind of behaviour. The question we have to ask is why the Minister allowed this situation to develop and to continue for so long. I will outline the failures of the department in this area in just a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that a government instruction was given, government policy was set, public statements were made about what the Government would do and what its intentions were, but the Audit Office has found that the department did not adequately respond to the Government's instructions. Who is responsible for a government department's failure to respond to government determinations and decisions? Surely the Minister should be monitoring whether or not government policy is being implemented by his department. Yet we have no evidence whatsoever that the Minister is either concerned, involved or taking any kind of rap for this failure to implement a policy which was publicly stated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, back in October 1990 the Commonwealth Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and the then Minister for Resources announced an action package of immediate measures&mdash;I stress the word `immediate'&mdash;to improve the use of energy in Australia and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Whether one is of the view that this is as urgent a matter as some people say is beside the point. The fact is that the Government said it was urgent and that immediate measures were needed. Senator Coulter has indicated that he will take this matter up after I have finished speaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ministers nominated a range of activities, including the expansion of some existing programs, to be run by their department in cooperation with other bodies and governments. They said that the programs were aimed at seeking better use of energy in our factories, offices, shops, homes and our roads. What did the Auditor-General find in his efficiency audit of this determined government policy? He found the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The package had not been adequately implemented by the Department. It has taken longer than anticipated to achieve significant advancement of the policies. In the implementation of some significant measures many months had elapsed before initiation of any action. After just over two years of elapsed time the ANAO has estimated that the package was one year behind what could have been achievable. The ANAO considers that this delay is unreasonable, in view of the sense of urgency envisaged by the Government and justified by consideration of the issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have massive delay in implementation of this program, and criticism of the department. What was the Minister doing? Did he ever go back to Cabinet and say, `Hey, my department and I are not doing too well on this. We need a few new resources, or something, but we are not doing it'. Maybe the Minister did do that, and maybe this Government, as is its custom, did not care that it was breaking its own word yet again on an issue that many Australians feel is very significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report with which we are dealing, the Audit Office noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that insufficient attention had been given to managing the programs, including those which had been in place prior to the announcement of the expansion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this immediate, significant, urgent, so-called expansion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in 1990. A number of the programs which had been started had not been able to approach their potential, because of deficiencies in planning and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>The Audit Office continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, the Department did not fully respond in the manner expected of it.</PARA>
<PARA>Who was responsible for that? Did some poor bureaucrat get his head kicked in? Or is it the Minister who is responsible? The Government, of course, is only too happy to allow members of the bureaucracy to stand aside, to `carry the can'. But the buck stops with the Minister. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Right up to the announcement in October 1990 it had not fully anticipated the greater priority to be given to the subject. Subsequently, it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the department&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">did not provide the numbers of people approved for the programs or make full use of those that were there.</PARA>
<PARA>The question is whether the Minister knew this and, if he did not, then why not. The question then is why the Minister did not inquire. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff meant to be available for putting the programs into place were heavily engaged on other tasks . . . This was the case right up until the time of our audit, more than two years after the announcement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the announcement of the program. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were a number of major organisational changes in 1990-91 which the Department allowed to disrupt the efficient implementation of the programs.</PARA>
<PARA>I will not continue with the general question of Australia's poor record in energy saving&mdash;no doubt Senator Coulter will talk about that&mdash;but I want to deal with the failure by the department and by the Minister. The department's research had shown that few people in Australia were aware of the need to save on energy. The ANAO concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public is still unaware and sceptical about Government programs and pronouncements on the topic&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>namely, the topic of energy saving. In other words, not only did the department do nothing itself, but it also failed to promote or encourage other people to do anything. The Government was allegedly desperate to implement an urgent, immediate policy, yet the Minister failed to ensure that the stated policy was implemented. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Department maintains that its aim has been to achieve steady and reasonable progress across all sectors, the ANAO considers that to date it has been unable to demonstrate significant and measurable energy savings in any of the energy end-use sectors.</PARA>
<PARA>That represents a 100 per cent failure rate. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The slow progress in improving the Commonwealth's application of its programs for energy efficiency within its own responsibilities is not conducive to obtaining rapid and effective responses from the community at large.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this was not a don't-do-as-I-say situation, because nothing was being said, and it was certainly not a  don't-do-as-I-do situation, because nothing was being done either. The department's own research showed that the Government was seen to be asking for action from other energy consumers but was not active in improving its own energy use. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure to allocate the full complement of resources to the task as originally anticipated risked confirming that view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the view held by the public. I conclude my remarks by referring to another comment by the ANAO in its report. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's reports&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the reports on this matter&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have concentrated on presenting the range of activities it has undertaken and which improve its public image.</PARA>
<PARA>It then makes this telling point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have not provided information on the real achievement in progress against objectives as called for by an accountability document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General, in the report's conclusion, considers that the department has not provided an objective view of its overall performance with the programs in its public reports. In other words, it has misled the public. The question is whether it has misled the Minister or whether the Minister went along with the misleading nature of these reports. The conclusion continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition we note that there has been a tendency to reinforce this public face within the Department itself. DPIE has not fully explored opportunities to place hard information in the public arena concerning the potential for economic gains in our usage of energy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The final conclusions of the Auditor-General in respect of ministerial responsibility and departmental competence&mdash;and the Government and people of Australia should take note of their significance&mdash;are these:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that the administrative platform established for the energy management programs would have been insufficient for ensuring the most effective contribution by DPIE to the longer term National Greenhouse Response Strategy. A key aspect is the importance of recognising practical implementation problems and structuring programs and implementation methods accordingly. The experience of the Department over the last three years is, however, a basis from which it can now move to a new level of achievement in national energy management.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very polite of the Australian National Audit Office to say that the department has learnt from its experience of doing nothing and might now be able to actually do something. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO has made a series of recommendations which will contribute to this objective. DPIE has responded positively to almost all of the recommendations made for improving future administrative effectiveness, expressing disagreement with only parts of two recommendations out of a total of nineteen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sounds like a mea maxima culpa from the department which now, at last, says it will do something. The major area of disagreement on recommended action relates to management of current evaluation programs. In this report we have a clear indication of failure of ministerial responsibility backing up a failure of departmental activity. We have to ask seriously who was responsible for these kinds of mistakes, these kinds of `administrative error' when there is a Minister who is getting paid for being the `responsible' Minister. If people are prepared to take the money, they have to take the flak and cop the responsibility. We have seen too many Ministers in this Government prepared to take the money but not do the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will begin where Senator Baume left off. The plot is even more sinister than is revealed in this Auditor-General's report because we have a government and a Minister intent on giving the impression that something is being done about greenhouse, whereas the Government, the Minister and the department under his direction have no real intention of doing anything at all. Thank goodness for accountants rather than economists because this is an excellent audit report and an excellent criticism of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have no doubt about the seriousness of the greenhouse problem. Perhaps rather than use that term, we should simply talk about the change in the global atmosphere. While there is some concern about the effect and rate of onset of those changes, there is no doubt that we are very rapidly changing the composition of the atmosphere&mdash;faster than at any time since life appeared on this planet. We are uncertain as to whether there will be a sea level rise, the extent of that rise, how rapidly it will come on, the effect of changes of climate, how quickly they will appear, and what will be the effect on agriculture. Because of the uncertainty principle, which is fundamental to the notion of ecologically sustainable development, we should proceed cautiously. For that reason these changes should be addressed urgently. We should vigorously attempt to slow down the rate of change because we do not know what the effects will be or when they will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings in the very important principle of intergenerational equity&mdash;the fact that we should not be imposing upon future generations problems to which we do not have a solution. This matter is also urgent for Australia because, although we have a relatively small population and our contribution to global atmosphere changes is small&mdash;somewhat less than two per cent&mdash;nonetheless on a per capita basis our contribution is very large. The report draws attention to that factor. If responsibility lies with people&mdash;and I believe it does&mdash;then the responsibility individually and collectively on Australians is very large because our per capita contribution to changes to the global atmosphere is very large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that as a background and recognising that a large number of Australians thought that this was an important issue which Australia should do something about, I suggest that it is clear that the Government wanted to give back to the community the perception that the Government was doing something about it but it had no real intention of changing anything at all. It simply wanted to continue with business as usual while keeping up the nice facade that, yes, it was addressing this greenhouse problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This became quite evident to me and to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology during its inquiry into the greenhouse question. The people from DPIE came before the committee and it was quite clear that they had no clue as to how they would address the problem. They were the people who had been specifically appointed within that department to address the problem of greenhouse, yet it seemed to me that they had been appointed to go through the motions of addressing the greenhouse problem but in fact had no intention of seriously doing anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that the programs which were set in place in 1990 were minuscule compared with the ultimate target which the Government had set&mdash;namely, the 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005. That is a 20 per cent reduction compared with the 1988 level of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet what was envisaged here was simply a four per cent reduction on the projected levels in the year 2005&mdash;a much more modest decrease. It was a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions brought about by energy efficiency improvements which would nonetheless save $1.5 billion annually. Yet, as Senator Baume has pointed out, two years on we are already one year behind in the implementation of even those very modest aims set in October 1990. The detailed report is extremely damning in many other respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year while Senator Button was Leader of the Government in the Senate, I asked him a couple of questions in relation to this greenhouse problem. I asked him, firstly, was the Government aware of the warning given at that time by 1,500 of the world's leading scientists, including half of the living Nobel Prize winning scientists, in relation to the need to change our attitude with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, with respect to resource use generally, with respect to population increase and so on? And, if so, would it make any difference? The answer he gave was, yes, he was aware of that warning but, no, it would make no difference to policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in a further question I asked him whether he was aware of the warnings coming from the Munich Reinsurance Company&mdash;the largest reinsurance company in the world&mdash;in relation to the costs of greenhouse and taking that into account against the costs of implementing energy efficiency changes and so on. But he was not even aware of those matters. Clearly, in a number of government reports and a number of reports from private right wing think-tanks, we see that the costs of addressing greenhouse are taken into account but the costs of not addressing the greenhouse problem are totally ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of years we have seen record grain crops in Western Australia and South Australia essentially destroyed by heavy tropical rain coming across from the Timor Sea late in the season and ruining those crops through rust and various other diseases. The temperature in the Timor Sea has risen by some five degrees in the last decade, and the storms which came across and brought that rain to South Australia were quite without precedent. Throughout the western parts of Queensland and New South Wales we are seeing drought which again is without precedent in the history of Australia since white settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No scientist is prepared to say that either of those things is directly related to greenhouse. However, most scientists are prepared to say that they are consistent with the sorts of changes one might expect with greenhouse. Both of those things have caused enormous losses to Australia. So the problems in relation to the cost of greenhouse certainly need to be taken into account, and the equations need to be done properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also failed to take more concerted action in relation to electricity utilities to force them to a situation in which they recognise themselves as providers of end use energy services rather than simply as providers of electricity. There is an enormous amount which could be done in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up one or two specific things which the Auditor-General says. One which I have found quite fascinating, because it is totally different from the approach which the Government has consistently taken over some time and totally different from the sorts of reports and the philosophical foundation we are getting from the Industry Commission, is the suggestion regarding the injection of an energy efficiency perspective into the taxation policy advising area. In other words, just as we recognise that we can intrude health considerations into the tax on cigarettes and alcohol, so should we take a wider view of taxation as a policy instrument&mdash;something for which the Democrats have been arguing for a long time. We recognise that taxation is a very useful instrument in changing people's behaviour in the way in which they use and abuse energy and therefore contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the important point to be brought out is the point made by the Auditor-General, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's reports have concentrated on presenting the range of activities it has undertaken and which improve its public image. They have not provided information on the real achievement in progress against objectives as called for by an accountability document.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the point Senator Baume concluded with. I think it is a point which should be stressed. I believe the problem goes deeper than just an apparent conflict between the Minister and the department, which is the point I think Senator Baume was making. I think that the Minister, the Government and the department are in collusion to give the impression that something is being done about greenhouse, whereas in fact very little is being done and very little will be done until this Government is pushed much harder. The problem is urgent, and I think that we could do a great deal more, with enormous cost savings to Australia. It will not cost the amounts that the Tasman Institute and other institutes have pointed to. Energy efficiency is not only good from the point of view of greenhouse, but it is also very good from the point of view of saving money. There are enormous opportunities in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $6 million that was announced in the Governor-General's speech is paltry compared with what we could do with one technology alone: solar hot water services. If we spent a hundred times that amount of money as seed money to get over the capital hurdle, the savings would be enormous in energy and greenhouse gas emissions, and we could expand an industry which could employ literally thousands of people and be worth billions of dollars. Australia has the leading edge in technology in this industry. It is an industry that is crying out for encouragement, using Australian labour and materials. It is just one example of a direction that we could take and of the way in which the Government is simply turning its back on what could be done. </PARA>

As previous speakers have said, it is no wonder the public is sceptical about the Government's commitment, firstly, to reducing greenhouse emissions in Australia and, secondly, the whole idea of reducing waste and benefiting Australia. I mean that sincerely. The department would benefit Australia if it were to show leadership in achieving either sustainable practices in agriculture or savings as a result of reducing waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes this whole matter so sensationally important as an example of what is wrong with the Government's attitude is revealed by a joint statement made on 23 October 1990 by Ministers Kerin and Griffiths. In that joint statement we see what I described earlier as the flurry, the fanfare, the big joint announcement. As Senator Coulter said earlier, we were told in this announcement that we were having initiatives put before us which would achieve $1.5 billion worth of energy savings annually by the year 2005. We were told in that announcement that this was the first step towards achieving the interim planning target to reduce greenhouse emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That first step was never really completed. The department is still on one leg; the other foot has not touched the ground yet. The leadership has not been implemented. The public is still waiting to be shown the path of savings and benefits to Australia. The $1.5 billion was a wonderful sounding figure but, of course, mentioning that figure and actually doing something are two different things. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) stands accused of having failed to ensure that the department implemented these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was needed was persistence and leadership. Instead, we have seen superficiality. As far as I am concerned, it has been demonstrated quite clearly over a number of years now in answers to questions that I have asked in this place. That applies not only to me, but to several others who have asked questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the first questions I asked in this place related to recycled paper and why it was not available for all members and senators. An excuse was given&mdash;that it was something to do with its being the fault of the Department of the Senate, that there was no communication with the Department of Administrative Services, or that the matter really belonged with the Joint House Department; I cannot remember what it was. But that excuse, of course, is reflective of an attitude which the Australian National Audit Office was able to detect throughout Australia, which it criticised and for which it gave a quite simple explanation of how the matter might be resolved. What is needed is better cooperation between departments, sharing of goals and a little understanding of what each department is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 74 of this report, we can see that the Audit Office is able to instruct DPIE on how it might go about coordinating this approach and suggests which particular departments it might be good to talk to&mdash;for example, local government associations; motorists and motor trade associations; building trades and building managers; energy appliance associations, especially for airconditioning; national industry extension services; energy supply associations; cross-sectoral industry associations; and other government departments, be they the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that these departments and organisations should be included in an understanding of the Government's true goal or what the Department of Primary Industries and Energy was trying to achieve as a result of the joint statement announcement on 23 October 1990 seems to be too simple to overlook. Yet it is obvious that the department did overlook it. We do not know whether the idea was intentionally overlooked or whether it was not adopted due to a lack of capacity. But the result has been the same: the attempt to reach the target has slipped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look at one simple example&mdash;paper usage. Senator Bolkus, quite rightly and proudly, announced a number of measures that were taken in his department 18 months or two years ago in order to reduce the use of new paper when it was not necessary, including the collection of waste paper to enable it to be recycled, thereby setting an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Envelopes made out of recycled paper were introduced in this place for use by members of parliament and government departments. However, one of the strange features of those envelopes is that they have little slots cut in the back of the flap that is folded down. This might not seem very important, but the function of those little slots means that if the envelope is used again, it tears. They are put there by design in order to stop people using the envelope twice. Those honourable senators who are nodding their heads or staring in blank amazement while wondering why I think this is important might like to consider how often these envelopes tear when opening them. That little cut works extremely well in preventing their reuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A department which allows that slot to remain on the envelopes that it uses is revealed as a department which does not have its heart in the whole issue. It does not understand what it is trying to achieve and it has not followed through. It has not been persistent in trying to get across the idea that the stated goal is essentially reducing waste. It has not delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an appearance of being concerned, but it is superficial, as is revealed by another seemingly tiny and insignificant matter. Day after day in Parliament House we see kilowatts of energy being wasted in illuminating globes that face daylight. I am indebted to Senator Coulter for doing a calculation which suggests that some 27 trillion kilowatts of light are available and hitting the earth's surface daily yet we find it necessary to illuminate another couple of dozen 50-watt globes in order to light our way around Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous; these lights are not needed at all. There is no reason to have those lights illuminated during daylight hours. They have been so illuminated since the day this place opened, I have asked a few questions about them and no reason has been advanced as to why they are there blazing away, chewing up energy in daylight hours. Those lights blazing away in daylight reveal and highlight the Government's misunderstanding, lack of commitment and total superficiality in this area of energy conservation and the reduction of waste. Those lights stand as a beacon revealing this Government's lack of commitment to that which it likes to trumpet as its common goal&mdash;the goal of annually saving $1.5 billion by the year 2005. It will never get there; that other foot will never hit the ground while there is such a lack of commitment which has been revealed by this particular audit report. I could go on for days&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give another couple of examples, because this needs to be rubbed in. A considerable amount of the $1.5 billion in projected savings is real money that is spent overseas, especially on importing oil. Some of the earliest questions I raised here in this place concerned ethanol. I know that some honourable senators were reduced to tears at the thought of another question on ethanol because there seemed to be an answer. There was no answer; there was an excuse about why the Australian Government was not intervening to assist with the development of an ethanol industry as an alternative fuel to add to our petroleum to replace some of the petroleum that we bought from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That question was only ever examined in a naked, pure production-cost comparison sense. There was no regard for the benefits that could accrue from such an activity&mdash;whether those benefits be in local employment, in the balance of trade, or in strategic benefits that would arise from the fact that we would have a variety of sources of fuel for our transport industries, or even environmental benefits such as the reduction of greenhouse emissions. There was no attempt to add those into the equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not very long ago we had a great fanfare about this wonderful new stuff called `diesohol'&mdash;the addition of some 10 per cent or so of ethanol to diesel as a fuel with an emulsifier. Now we see a flurry of press releases, a bit of fanfare and a few clever one-liners on TV. But where is government commitment and intervention to encourage this industry? Where is government purchasing or support in terms of real tangible work? We do not see it. Instead, we see the superficial attention grabbing, sort of chameleon-like hopping onto one issue for five minutes by various Ministers. When it comes down to it, the world has not changed and Australia has not progressed towards saving this $1.5 billion per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that same attitude repeated throughout government activities, I would suggest. We see electricity-saving programs with a few stickers thrown out, a bit of a show here and there, a couple of posters&mdash;but no follow-up; it does not get done. The public can still see waste, whether it be in the lighting and heating of government buildings or the larger issues such as the motor vehicle fleet of Australia, which is again revealed in this report on page 50. We see it there, and it is quite easily understood. The audit office has drawn a pretty picture for the Government and the department cannot help understanding this. Here we have the Australian fleet new vehicle fuel consumption shown to have reached a flattening point on the graph, which is above the fuel consumption of such vehicles in the United Kingdom, Canada, USA, Japan and Italy&mdash;with Italy setting an example which is at least three, perhaps four litres per 100 kilometres leaner, more efficient than the Australian fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not seem to be interested enough, we do not seem to be committed enough and we do not seem to be prepared enough to take the necessary steps to actually achieve progress in this area. Whether or not the steps that are necessary for government intervention are steps towards, as Senator Coulter suggested, actually intervening and striving for the goal of using that 27 trillion kilowatts of energy available from the sun by the use of solar hot water heaters, or whether we take up and market better the woollen insulation available in Australia, we must do something. We cannot send out another press release making another statement which, with present attitudes, is not achievable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now debating two important pieces of legislation and the coalition will be supporting both. The first, a Bill to amend the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945, will implement changes that would facilitate the support by Australia of international sanctions under the auspices of the United Nations. In principle we support it and, furthermore, we are prepared to support the detail. The second Bill, the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill 1993, is the tenth IDA replenishment Bill which provides further commitments by Australia to the soft lending arm of the World Bank to help in the alleviation of global poverty, and we also support that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the UN Bill for a few minutes. I know the Senate is under some pressure of time already this session; nevertheless, there are a few things that I wanted to say on behalf of the coalition. It is a difficult time for the international community, as we have passed through the Cold War phase and now find the establishing of a new world order much more difficult than many envisaged. Unfortunately, we are in a period of international development where ethnic, communal, religious or national conflicts seem to have broken out and have replaced the former major, superpower tensions with numerous smaller conflicts. Nevertheless, they are conflicts of great brutality and often of a highly complex and difficult nature in terms of providing a resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition obviously supports the international community through the auspices of the United Nations doing all that is reasonably possible to try to stabilise these conflicts. Therefore, it supports the commitment of Australia as part of the United Nations. We have often commended the contribution of Australia in peacekeeping forces throughout the world. I think one should put on record the very worthwhile contribution that Australian military forces have just made in Somalia&mdash;the prime part of that force is about to return to Australia&mdash;as well as the highly commendable work that Australia's defence forces are continuing to perform in Cambodia and elsewhere throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is how Australia might better or further contribute to this work. This Bill looks at one particular contribution, where the international community as a group has decided that the imposition of some pressure is necessary to try to bring a state to recognise that a peaceful resolution of problems is the way we would all prefer in terms of the new world order. We think of the imposition of sanctions in such places as Iraq, some of which still apply, and particularly&mdash;as I think is the cause of this legislation&mdash;sanctions that have been imposed in the former Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that there are a number of different tools that the international community has to try to bring conflict to an end. Inducements can be offered; diplomacy can play its part; but there is in some circumstances the need for the international community to apply pressure, in the form of, say, arms embargoes or economic sanctions. Ultimately the pressure might be in the form of the application of military force, as we saw in the case of Iraq. Nevertheless, it is important that the Government of Australia has a reasonably free hand in meeting our international responsibility in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept the argument that the Government has put that to date it has been a difficult process and the reform of the law would facilitate our contribution in this way. Thus, we are prepared to support this piece of legislation. On another occasion, when the Senate has more time, we on this side of the chamber would appreciate a wider debate on how the future development of the UN might occur and how Australia should contribute further to peacekeeping, peacemaking and peace enforcing roles; the issues of a ready deployment force, other opportunities for preventative action by the UN, the establishment of permanent funds to enable the UN to better meet the responsibility given to it by the international community in these tasks; the role that we and others in the international community can play in promoting democracy as a contribution towards stability and, therefore, peace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the Australian Government's willingness to send observers, of which I was privileged to be one, to the recent referendum in Eritrea. I think not everyone understands the contribution that good governance&mdash;as it has being referred to these days&mdash;can play in contributing to peace; just as development aid can contribute to stability and, therefore, ultimately to peaceful environments. It is a complex issue and our contribution is made at a number of different levels. One of the levels at which we are definitely required to make a contribution from time to time&mdash;and would want to make a contribution&mdash;is the application of sanctions. This Bill better enables the Australian Government to do that and we are therefore prepared to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the IDA Bill, there is an ongoing debate as to what part of Australia's total aid contribution should be made up of support for the international financial institutions&mdash;in particular, support for the soft lending arms such as the IDA in relation to the World Bank and also the soft window of the Asian Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been somewhat critical of World Bank operations in the past. I think I acknowledged in the last speech I gave on this subject that there had been improvement in the World Bank in looking at the broader development agenda. I think that credit should be given to the fact that the World Bank is now more willing to look at the social consequences of its policies. It is prepared to acknowledge, for example, the value of improving the environment for the wider development of Third World countries, and it is now prepared to acknowledge the critically important role of women within its programs. I think that more sensitive appreciation from the economists&mdash;the somewhat formerly pure economists&mdash;of the World Bank is something that should be acknowledged and applauded. We believe the World Bank has been heading in the right direction and we therefore recognise that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recognise that, as far as Australia's contribution is concerned, there are ways in which we can contribute more appropriately to development in the Third World through the major organisations such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank rather than through our own bilateral program. I think particularly of places such as Africa where we are less equipped at the diplomatic level to have a bilateral aid program that can be properly monitored and implemented. So we recognise the important role of the multilateral support within the total aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But also, generally speaking, this side of the chamber has a preference for programs being implemented through a bilateral method in which there is a more direct Australian contribution. We have expressed some concern in recent years at the increasing proportion of the aid vote that has been taken up by the contributions to both the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, we believe at a cost to the bilateral program. I recognise that in dollar terms this contribution to the tenth replenishment does seem to be a step back, but we do not know what the aid vote will be in the forthcoming Budget. If aid is reduced, as we suspect it will be in the light of Australia's economic difficulties, it may well be not as we would first appreciate in dollar terms&mdash;it may well be that our contribution to the multilaterals continues to increase as a percentage of the aid vote. If that is the case, we would regret that and we would make that point on some future occasion. As I have said, basically we support the work that is being done by the IDA and we support Australia's contribution to the tenth replenishment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support the passage of the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill 1993 and the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill. The first of these two Bills deals with the important matter of the implementation of United Nations resolutions and, in this case, specifically allows regulations to be made implementing Australia's obligations under the United Nations charter. Importantly, the Bill also provides for the imposition of fines for breach of the regulations and allows the Attorney-General to seek injunctions to restrain such a breach. Because of the obvious importance of the Bill and the non-military nature of strengthening the original Act, the Australian Democrats are pleased to support its passage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the end of the Cold War, in the absence of the superpower rivalry that so hampered the United Nations, the international community has been given a unique opportunity to strengthen the effectiveness of its resolutions, particularly in instances where economic sanctions are being applied in conflict situations. The Australian Democrats recognise that in many instances a failure to implement sanctions has effectively eroded respect for and the authority of the United Nations. It is therefore important that Australia play its part in strengthening international peace and security by placing itself in a position to implement fully international obligations arising out of the world body's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill deals with a separate matter: the authorisation of a further contribution by Australia towards the International Development Association. In this particular case, the further payment consists of a total of $350 million. The Parliament has regularly dealt with such amendment Bills and the Democrats have always supported their passage. While we will be doing so again today, the Australian Democrats are concerned&mdash;and we have made this point in the past&mdash;that these payments, significant as they are, are contributions which Australia makes to overseas development at the expense of our overall overseas aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be fully aware that Australia's aid budget has suffered consistent cuts over the last 10 years. Many good, worthwhile schemes and development programs have either had their funds cut off or have been deferred because of funding cuts by this Government. In many instances, funds which Australia allocates to multilateral institutions, such as the World Bank and the International Development Association, have been immune to government funding cuts because of the three-year or five-year nature of their program funding commitments. However, ordinary bilateral development programs have had no such ongoing commitments and, by their very nature, it has always been much easier for the Government to cut their funding. The Democrats have consistently opposed these funding cuts. They are totally unacceptable and we will continue to argue against cuts to Australia's aid budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the ongoing funding concerns that the Democrats have consistently expressed in relation to these matters, we would once again like to place on record our belief that the World Bank, which funds development programs through the International Development Association, needs to broaden its selection criteria so that development programs which place a greater emphasis on both women and environmental concerns are taken into account. The Democrats have argued that one way in which the Government could assist these goals is to take action and permit its alternative executive director position at the World Bank to be open to a wider range of public officials. This would allow for suitable public officers with experience in the development field the opportunity to serve in that position. At the moment, it is a matter of some regret that Australia's position at the World Bank is only open to Treasury officials. Unfortunately, this accentuates the financial aspects of the International Development Association's operation to the detriment of its development operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will be aware that it was a recommendation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that the selection criteria for Australia's position at the World Bank be opened up so that a wide range of public officers be given the opportunity to serve in this capacity. It remains true that the World Bank and a number of the big multinational, multilateral financial and development institutions need to become more sensitive in developing strategies to ensure that the needs of the people in the Third World that they are aiming to assist are, first and foremost, on the agenda. I have very grave concerns about the way in which the World Bank operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we simply transferring resources, only to have them neatly ricochet back through a variety of arrangements such as trade agreements? Are we really trying to impose First World solutions onto the Third World? One way in which Australia can assist is to appoint to the World Bank officers who have a greater awareness of development issues, rather than a strictly financial view of the development agenda. Apart from these concerns that I have mentioned, the Australian Democrats will be supporting these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill and the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill. The second reading speech on the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill was delivered in this chamber on 6 May, and I saw red when I read the following in the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill's primary purpose is to allow the Governor-General in Council to make regulations implementing Australia's obligations under the United Nations Charter. It also provides for the imposition of fines for breach of the regulations and allows the Attorney-General to seek injunctions to restrain such a breach.</PARA>
<PARA>That really concerned me. As honourable senators know, I have been consistently pointing out in this place that much legislation and many decisions taken by the Australian Government unfairly and unduly rely on the external affairs power. It is important for this chamber and the Parliament as a whole to give detailed consideration to the terms of conventions and other international instruments, particularly United Nations instruments, entered into by the Government. Once the Government relies on its external affairs power, the subsequent legislation passed as a result thereof is binding, notwithstanding the decisions and legislation of the various States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All senators will know that I have given notice of motion to establish a standing committee on treaties. All treaties entered into or to be entered into by the Government&mdash;their implications for Commonwealth laws, State laws and even local government regulations&mdash;should be referred to that committee. I am reinforced in my intention to pursue that notice of motion during this Parliament because two weeks ago 30 or 40 treaties were dumped on the table. I stand to be corrected on the number but it was a very substantial number, and we have five minutes to debate each of those in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst those treaties were the ILO Convention concerning Termination of Employment at the Initiative of the Employer and the ILO Convention concerning Protection of Facilities to be Afforded to Workers' Representatives in the Undertaking. Those two treaties are important, given the unfortunate predilection of some people in the Government to consider that awards will somehow end up as safety nets, and workers in those nets will find themselves trapped. I wanted to have a very serious look at those particular conventions. The Convention for the Mutual Recognition of Inspections in respect of the Manufacture of Pharmaceutical Products is another important treaty. Do we take for granted the inspection procedures that operate in certain countries, including the UK where a number of these measures are considered by non-elected elites? I feel a number of treaties should be the subject of detailed scrutiny by the Parliament, the elected representatives of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum to this Bill states that the primary purpose of the Bill is to allow the Governor-General-in-Council to make regulations implementing Australia's obligations under the United Nations charter. But I observe that the Bill is restricted to the obligation to abide by sanctions imposed by the Security Council against states which are determined to have breached or threaten to breach international peace and security. In recent times, such sanctions have been imposed against Iraq, Libya, Yugoslavia&mdash;Serbia and Montenegro. The explanatory memorandum further points out that resolutions imposing such sanctions generally decide that states shall prevent trade and other specified transactions with the offending state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill intends to enable the Governor-General-in-Council to make regulations dealing with situations which fall outside the present regulatory framework&mdash;in other words, to make effective sanctions imposed by the Security Council. I can understand that and I can understand perhaps why that should be a matter of regulation. I understand these regulations will be subject to disallowance by the Parliament. Nevertheless, I am concerned about the precedent that might be established by this Bill. I would like to see that question tested somehow or other. I would like to hear from the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) during the committee stage some greater explanation of the intention of the Government and some absolute guarantee that this is not to be regarded in any shape or form as a precedent for the Government to make regulations in respect of other matters contained in other treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill. These measures come before the chamber once every year. I am rather attracted to some of the points that have been made; that is to say, if it is at all possible our overseas development assistance should be on a coordinated basis, but on a basis whereby we have substantial control over the direction of the funding of particular overseas development assistance projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, this is not the case so far as the World Bank is concerned. If it is, I would like to know the answers to the following questions: why do we allow the World Bank to interfere in Bangladesh to keep workers' wages down? Why do we condone the World Bank's operations in Burma when the Government of that country, SLORC, is roundly and unanimously condemned in this chamber? Why, if the Government is so dead against a GST&mdash;and I throw this in for its response&mdash;does it support an organisation which is going around to every developing country and telling it to introduce a GST? A number of other questions also come to mind, one of which concerns the World Bank's absolute fetish about lending money for population control programs without examining the issue thoroughly and without any truly objective appraisal of those population control programs or their effects on the various countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it is a topical issue, I refer particularly to the World Bank's $US32 million program of population control in Papua New Guinea. It is ironic, is it not, that soon after the chief economist of the Bank of Papua New Guinea had made the observation that Papua New Guinea is a country with enormous natural resources and low density population, the World Bank involved itself in urging the Papua New Guinea Government to adopt a population control policy. Indeed, it is doing a little more than urging, and I think the Senate should hear this. In effect, it is saying, `Look, donor organisations should not give anything to the Government of Papua New Guinea unless it adopts a population control program'. I would like to read from an excerpt of the AIDAB appraisal note of that particular program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before dinner I was speaking to the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill, which deals with the World Bank, and I raised a number of issues for the Government to respond to. I referred to the involvement of the World Bank with SLORC in Burma, to the push by the World Bank to keep wages down in Bangladesh and the proposal of the World Bank for developing countries to institute a GST.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is handy that we have these debates to enable the Government to respond to some of these questions. There are far more important issues at stake when we are considering the World Bank and when we are considering taxpayers' money going to the World Bank. It is my view&mdash;and I think it is pretty well shared around the chamber&mdash;that, if possible, priority should be given for overseas development assistance to be more closely directed towards those projects and those countries for which Australia has responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also dealing with the issue of the World Bank's fetish about population control. This fetish has manifested itself to such an extent that the World Bank has recently proposed and is implementing a $US32 million population control program for Papua New Guinea. It is called a population and family planning project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is evident from World Bank documents, this project was not initially supported by governments at the national and provincial level in Papua New Guinea, but I will say more about that at some future time. The push for this particular policy is clear from the pre-feasibility study that was done by an Australian consultant to AIDAB, who indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time, then, that leading citizens and foreigners seek to influence attitudes to and trends in PNG population growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The callous and disturbing nature of the population control program is reflected in a comment from the AIDAB report, the oppressive implications of which are far reaching. Paragraph 10.8 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall efficiency of donor assistance would dictate against the allocation of resources to ameliorating living conditions in `stressed' and `peri-urban' regions until capacity to improve and sustain improvements is released by declining fertility. This strategy would recognise the Government's recurrent efforts in indirectly influencing fertility, but would not add to the resources so applied.</PARA>
<PARA>So what it is really saying to the PNG people is, `Get this population control policy off the ground or you will not get any aid'. That is an unfair blaming of the fertility of poor women in that country for the problems of that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Papua New Guineans on the ground will say that their problems are manifest. They want more attention and money provided for projects such as vocational training and genuine health care. People in Papua New Guinea are dying of pneumonia for the want of antibiotics, yet the World Bank is imposing these sorts of policies on that country without&mdash;and this is the point that I made just prior to dinner&mdash;any real examination of even the economic aspects of such programs or their effect on long-term dependency ratios at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is surprising that the World Bank seems to take as given that there are too many people in, for example, Papua New Guinea. One argument has been that there are so many rascals and that this measure will somehow attend to that problem. Compared with the problems in Los Angeles, the problem of rascals in Papua New Guinea is minuscule; yet the city of Los Angeles is probably exceeding World Bank Third World population control prescriptions. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak only to the first of these two Bills, which is the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill 1993. I speak in opposition to the Bill. I realise that I am a lone voice in this regard, but I feel that the Bill raises some important issues, fails to address some others and would require much more scrutiny on my part and questions to be answered before I could support it in its present form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill raises some important issues. Firstly, it seeks to establish a mechanism by which the Governor-General in Council can make regulations implementing Australia's obligations under the United Nations charter. We are told in the explanatory memorandum that this is necessary because the current means of implementing sanctions are inadequate. The measures, whilst described as being largely effective, have not prohibited all activities in breach of United Nations sanctions. It also refers to the fact that different resolutions have required implementation by way of making use of regulations under the Customs Act 1901, the Air Navigation Act 1920, the Banking Act, the Migration Act 1958 and some others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am all in favour of an adequate way to fulfil the requirements of our covenants and agreements with the United Nations. Until now, a range of sanctions has been implemented in various circumstances by means of regulations under a whole clutch of existing Acts. The Bill before the Senate seeks to draw together the means by which sanctions can be implemented, thus fulfilling Australia's international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all well and good, but we have not been told the kind of regulations that the Government wants to be able to make which cannot be made under the present system. I find it difficult to understand how previous sanction regimes could have been put in place if these powers did not already exist. Did we not freeze South African accounts? Have we not been able to prevent Australian companies from providing computer services to South Africa? Perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) may like to enlighten us on some of these issues later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter raised by the Bill is that regulations made under this Bill would be subject to disallowance by the Parliament as provided for in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. This is made clear in the explanatory memorandum. However, it is hard not to come to the conclusion that the Government does not intend for such regulations ever to be disallowed. It has been at great pains to point out that, if Australia does not implement sanctions as required by United Nations Security Council resolution, we will be in breach of our international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that by using this approach to the implementation of sanctions the Parliament is being denied implicitly, if not explicitly, its functions of scrutinising the work of executive government. But more&mdash;and this is a more positive approach for opposing this Bill&mdash;if the Executive can implement sanctions simply by regulation and effectively without parliamentary scrutiny, then those sanctions will be put in place with far less public attention than has previously been given. A positive process by which sanctions are implemented must be preferred so that Australia as a whole can own the action being taken against a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of sanctions surely is to let a foreign country know that its actions are unacceptable to the international community. If that is so, then Australians should be aware of the actions being taken in their name. I believe that this Bill reduces the level of public awareness. I realise that the Government does not intend to act in secret in implementing sanctions, but I believe that having such sanctions at the very least debated in the Parliament is an important part of public awareness. As we know, sanctions cause grave harm to civilians, including children, and can place us in a questionable position in relation to human rights. It is something that does need scrutiny and open debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter which does not appear in the Bill itself although it has been raised in the Bill's documentation. We are told that the legislation will not have the effect of taking away from the Government the power to decide whether the imposition of sanctions against a particular foreign state is in Australia's national interests. Paragraph 6 of the explanatory memorandum reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will not have the effect of taking away from the Government the power to decide whether the imposition of sanctions against a particular foreign state is in Australia's national interests.</PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would only be after the making of regulations under the legislation, which would be subject to the normal provisions regarding disallowance in the Parliament, that sanctions would be implemented. It would be open to persons aggrieved by a decision to make particular regulations to claim that their making was neither necessary nor convenient for applying measures adopted by the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot understand how this can be, given the emphasis on Australia's international obligations. Either we are going to abide by our obligations as part of the international community, or we are going to follow the dubious dictates of `Australia's best interests'. It seems strange to me that we would want to pass such legislation but still retain a right to say no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of questions need to be answered concerning this Bill, and it needs more work. If I had had sufficient time to look at this, I would have moved an amendment which referred the Bill to a committee. I realise that I am the only person who has expressed these concerns, apart from Senator Harradine who did raise some similar questions to mine, and I feel that further scrutiny by a committee would be warranted to allow such a committee to examine this Bill in terms of four issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, there is the manner in which it reduces parliamentary scrutiny in relation to the Executive Government's exercise of its obligations under the charter of the United Nations. In the present situation, as has been said, regulations are made under a number of Acts thus presenting the Parliament with a range of disallowance options. The Parliament does not have to throw out the entire set of sanctions applied in a particular case but can be more selective. So the Bill appears to reduce this scrutiny mechanism to only one measure, thereby forcing the Parliament to either accept or reject in toto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Bill needs to be examined in terms of the effectiveness of the disallowance provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 in relation to actions by the Government in implementing resolutions of the UN Security Council. Can it be said that the Parliament has an effective disallowance power if, in the exercise of that power, it puts Australia into breach of its international obligations under the United Nations charter? While the history of sanctions under Security Council resolutions to date has been praiseworthy and Australia has not sought to differ from such resolutions, should we enact legislation which is based only on that history? Can the United Nations not change in such a way that Australia may at some future time disagree with the sanctions resolution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter relates to the effectiveness of the current means of enacting sanctions available to the Government. The Charter of the United Nation Act has been in existence for over 45 years. While it is true to say that during that time, for various reasons, sanctions have been a rare means of action by the international community, they have been used&mdash;sometimes effectively and with wide ranging support, and sometimes not. At times, some of us have argued that sanctions should have been used when military force was used instead. I find it interesting that the Government has now discovered that it has insufficient powers to implement sanctions adequately. If the Senate is to deal properly with this request for a change of this nature, I believe that we are duty bound to examine the change very carefully before passing the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, does the Bill overcome the perceived deficiencies in the current sanctions regulation mechanisms? There are two ways of looking at that question: either the Government wants a completely free hand in making any regulations it wants and which it feels may suit the situation&mdash;I am not sure that the community would be comfortable with such an open-ended mechanism&mdash;or the Government can inform the Senate of precisely those powers which it believes it will need to meet situations which may arise. Of necessity, that would be far more difficult an approach but one which may be more satisfactory in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has a feel about it of being rushed. Very few people have heard of it and there has been no public debate. No doubt some honourable senators will want to tell me that debating how we enact UN sanctions is not likely to provide the riveting television viewing of the pay TV exercise and that generating public debate will be almost impossible. No matter how true or otherwise such a view may be, the nature of the legislation is such, I believe, that at the very least there should be opportunity for public debate. That can only happen if we in this place ensure that legislation receives the scrutiny that would take place through the committee process. That is my reason for opposing this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am indebted to most of the Senate&mdash;Senator Chamarette is the conspicuous exception&mdash;for its support of the Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill and the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill. I will not seek to detain the Senate longer than is necessary to respond to the major issues that have been raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the UN charter legislation is very amply spelt out in the second reading speech and I would have hoped that it might have been persuasive for Senator Chamarette. We have managed to do without such legislation for a long time by means of relying on the Customs Act, the Air Navigation Act, the Banking Act, the Migration Act and similar regulation conferring enactments to implement the sanctions regimes of the past. But as the world becomes a more complicated place, as the UN plays the role that we&mdash;and Senator Chamarette conspicuously among us&mdash;have been arguing it should play, it has become apparent that the sanctions mechanisms, the machinery available to the UN, need to be flexible and potentially very wide ranging in order to fully explore all of the options that are available short of taking armed intervention action to deal with particular situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the history of the situation in Yugoslavia, where, until very recently, the sanctions provisions that have been urged upon the international community by the Security Council have been able to be implemented effectively but as the situation has further deteriorated, as people have sought desperately to find measures short of open and unrestrained armed international intervention to deal with this situation, so too the sanctions provisions have become more complex and far-reaching and have now exceeded the bounds of Commonwealth legislative capacity to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the second reading speech makes clear, we do lack a legislative basis by which we can ensure compliance with at least some of the new provisions imposed by UN Security Council resolution 820 on 17 April, which came into effect on 26 April, which means that we have already been, for some days, in breach of our obligations by virtue of our inability to implement these measures including the freezing of funds held in Australia by the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or companies based there, and also so far as our capacity to prevent individuals or firms from providing various services is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette raised the question as to whether or not we had been down that track before, so far as South Africa is concerned. The short answer is no. The South African trade sanctions regime has been quite a limited one. As has been required of us by the Commonwealth and by the United Nations, it certainly has not extended thus far, and certainly we have never put any similar provision in place. Quite briefly, all I can say is that we need this kind of authority to be able to respond in this way. What we are seeking is not unique so far as the rest of the world is concerned. Again, the second reading speech makes clear that legislation like this has been in place in the United States, Canada, the UK and New Zealand since the 1940s. It is only now that we are getting round to giving ourselves the weaponry, legislatively, that we need. And we need it as a matter of urgency, which is why it comes before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully understand the concerns of people like Senator Harradine about possible overuse, abuse or misuse of the external affairs power under the Constitution. I think Senator Harradine himself acknowledges that, notwithstanding his views on this legislation, what is proposed here is squarely, on any view, within the intent of the external affairs power. There is no hint of legislative artifice so far as this particular exercise is concerned. It is wholly to do with the implementation of what are, on any view, clear-cut international obligations. I am indebted to Senator Harradine for his acknowledgment in this respect. I do take the point that he makes, that it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that one would contemplate giving oneself the capacity to implement, by way of regulations, international obligations of this kind. It may be that exceptional circumstances could arise again in the future. I cannot anticipate that, but certainly I can assure him that it is not proposed in any way at all that this be a routine way in the future of implementing treaty or other international obligations; far from it. We acknowledge the gravity of the issues that are here involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill, in the course of expressing the Opposition's general support for this legislation, indicated his desire that an opportunity be made available at some stage for a fuller debate on the whole question of the UN security role in the post cold war world: peacekeeping, peacemaking, peace enforcement, preventative diplomacy and all the rest.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much sympathise with that suggestion. We will do our best to make the time available. A lot depends on the capacity of this chamber to organise its business over the next session so that we have time to do something other than legislate and squabble about irrelevancies, but we will do our best to create that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the other legislation, the International Development Association (Further Payment) Bill 1992, is concerned, a number of points have been made&mdash;some general ones first of all about the aid program, its size and its balance. As to the size of the aid program, I could not help but think it was with a small degree of chutzpah that the Opposition addressed the question of potential reductions in the overall size of the aid budget, given the way in which it went into the last election campaign committed to slash $209 million a year off the aid budget with consequences that were dramatic in the extreme so far as capacity to behave as the good international citizen we would like to be in these matters is concerned. The implications for not only multilateral aid assistance of the kind that is involved in this legislation but also bilateral country programs would have been just stark and devastating had we been obliged to impose cuts of that order of magnitude. That should be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the argument that the aid budget at the moment, and this particular measure as well, involves too much enthusiasm for multilateral aid delivery strategies rather than bilateral ones, let me make a few quick points. Multilateral assistance programs should be seen not as some kind of exotic add-on only there because of some equally exotic need to satisfy international concerns. Multilateral support, through financial institutions like the World Bank, is a crucially relevant part of the aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides a means for Australia to assist countries where we do not have bilateral programs, and on a scale which would be impossible if we were to be just acting by ourselves. That is conspicuously the case for a number of areas in Africa. The multilateral development organisations have the influence to secure policy reforms which are necessary for equitable growth, which is very difficult to achieve through any bilateral forms of aid assistance or accompanying pressure. Through the development banks, again, Australia can address issues of concern and avoid the Big Brother label which sometimes does hang upon us&mdash;especially, for example, with smaller states in the Pacific&mdash;and avoid, as a result, strains on our diplomatic relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that the bank's development agencies play a very valuable role in coordinating the efforts of different donors. For example, the bank's role in Papua New Guinea is particularly important in ensuring that our bilateral dollar goes further in this respect, and I will come back to the population issue in a moment. The research and analysis that are available through the resources of the institutions is a great asset in managing our own bilateral program. It has been particularly useful in this respect, again, in our own South Pacific area. All this is in addition to the obvious opportunities which participation in these programs gives us to get procurement, goods and services for Australian businesses, and the opportunity to influence the overall shape of the bank's programs, including giving greater emphasis to poverty alleviation&mdash;all of which has been part of our general strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not a matter of an either/or approach to this question of multilateral versus bilateral aid. We believe both forms of aid are complementary, are necessary, and are important in effective aid delivery. Beyond that, I think I do not need to labour that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of some of the specific issues that have been raised by Senator Harradine, he said that the World Bank is  interfering in Bangladesh to keep workers' wages down. It is the case that Bangladesh has a structural adjustment program in place in which the IMF and the World Bank are both involved. But the policy dialogue which has resulted in these measures has been a genuine dialogue. The agreements that have flowed from it have been mutual in character. The point that has been accepted and acknowledged by the Bangladesh Government is the need to keep public sector wages at levels which the country itself can afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate from an old trade unionist's perspective&mdash;the perspective of a traditional trade unionist, not an elderly trade unionist; I wish to make that distinction perfectly clear to Senator Harradine&mdash;maybe that point does not have a graphic appeal. But certainly from the point of view of the debate, the discussion, and the agreements which have occurred in that country, I think the point really does need to be seen in that light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the Government, I am asked, condone World Bank operations in Burma? My understanding is that the World Bank is doing nothing other than engaging in a kind of marking time operation in Burma with the UNDP. Other UN agencies are essentially doing much the same&mdash;grassroots-type activity only. I am advised that it is not easy to see what the basis is for the apprehensions that have been expressed by the honourable senator in that respect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Harradine made about GST is a less substantial one, and even he would acknowledge that. I am not sure whether there is any particular prevailing taxation ideology as far as the World Bank is concerned. It may well be that from time to time it has urged macro taxation policies of that kind upon particular donee countries&mdash;that is not inconceivable&mdash;but, even if we fundamentally disagreed with the utility or sense of that strategy, it would be very difficult to suggest that we chop off our support for the World Bank and all its other worthwhile programs on that policy ground alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as Papua-New Guinea is concerned, I am well aware of the concerns that Senator Harradine has expressed in a number of different contexts about population policy, and I do not want to go into the basic debate yet again. The World Bank, together with AIDAB and the Asian Development Bank, has embarked upon a five-year population and family planning project estimated to cost $US33 million, with Australia's contribution at just half that amount. However, there are some compelling demographic, social and health policy reasons for supporting this project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been advised of the following statistics: at least one in 40 women in Papua-New Guinea will die in pregnancy or childbirth, compared to one in 17,000 in Australia; infant mortality has been put as high as one in five in some remote areas of Papua-New Guinea; the overall population is expected to double in the 30 years between 1980 and 2010. Taking into account the circumstances of Papua-New Guinea, there is a serious population policy issue to be addressed. It is certainly expected that access to family planning services will improve maternal and infant mortality rates as well as moderating population growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial component of the PNG program, so far as we are concerned, is that the choice of fertility options for individuals and couples should be absolutely free and informed.

It was said at that conference that expenditure on pharmaceuticals for birth control methods will not overcome or alleviate the problem of high maternal death rates. It was said that much of the problem is caused through transportation. In some of the highland areas, the principal cause of the high infant mortality rate is pneumonia. These young children are dying for want of antibiotics. Malaria is another aspect. These are the areas where money should be spent on health rather than on birth control drugs and devices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the last point, the World Bank IDA loan I presume is as soft to Papua New Guinea as it is everywhere else, which means that it is about the softest loan in the business. The payback duration and the likely interest-free character of it&mdash;if it is the same as most of these things&mdash;would be such as to reduce the character and extent of the burden. I am not going to get into a debate on the other issues about direct or indirect routes to achieving maternal and child health.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just take one more minute to correct one misapprehension&mdash;that is, there has been some significant continuing deterioration in the aid vote over recent years. The fact of the matter is that there has been a real increase&mdash;3.3 per cent, 3.7 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively&mdash;in each of the last three years. There was a deficit decrease the year before, 1989-1990. That was largely an optical illusion because of a bring-forward just before the end of the previous financial year which had the effect of rather artificially increasing the amount of the real increase in that previous year, 1988-1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that there has only really been one big plunge in Australia's aid commitment and that was in the 1986 Budget when there was a very dramatic reduction in order to cope with the budgetary crisis that we confronted in that year. Since then, the Government has been holding the line or better in terms of the aid budget. I hope that we will be able to do so again this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the motion by the Government that two Bills be read a second time. The first is the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill, which concerns a review of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. The second is the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill, which concerns some small adjustments to the Australian National Training Authority, that is, the new coordinating and initiating body of the Commonwealth in the area of technical and further education, or TAFE. So we have two Bills, both of which are relatively minor in terms of making adjustments to these two areas of the Commonwealth's administration of education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has given careful consideration to these measures, and we in the Liberal and National parties will not be opposing these two Bills. Neither do we have any particular amendments. In a few minutes I will indicate some questions that I would put to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) with regard to the implementation of these measures so that we can all be up to date as to where the Government is with regard to its intentions for the review of NBEET and for the implementation of ANTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was five years ago, in June 1988, that we saw the legislation in the Parliament&mdash;initiated by the Hawke Labor Government, the Minister at the time being Mr John Dawkins&mdash;proposing the establishment of a national board for employment, education and training. It was somewhat controversial because, I would put it, the centralising Minister, Mr Dawkins, had a radical agenda for reordering education as far as Canberra was concerned. At that time we saw amalgamations of universities, the imposition of profiles worked out in back rooms between the Commonwealth Government and individual universities, and the abolition of the longstanding Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission which, for 20 years and more, had served this nation so well. It was abolished; the Schools Commission was abolished; and we had a new statutory authority/bureaucracy put in place called NBEET, the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition were sceptical of all these measures of Minister Dawkins, and our scepticism has been proved to have been the right attitude to have taken. In fact, we quickly came to oppose a number of these measures&mdash;for instance, the amalgamations and the over-centralised control of education from Canberra. In the final weeks of the sitting in the old Parliament House in June 1988 it was seen to be important that this new body, when set up, have a period for establishment and, after five years, review. In fact, we did not get any chance to have any substantial debate on this new measure because the Bill was guillotined in the House of Representatives and was guillotined in the Senate. When one looks back, the speeches at that time were minuscule. There is no reference of any substance to the provision that there be a review of NBEET after five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, some of our fears about NBEET, expressed at that time&mdash;and, for example, increasingly expressed in my own speeches in the Senate over the last several years&mdash;I am afraid, have been fulfilled. We were concerned that NBEET was too much in the pocket of the Minister and was too much just an adjunct to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It was not independent enough, it did not have an independent charter, and that was not only the board but also its four subsidiary councils, to which a fifth has virtually been added now. We not only have the council for schools, the council for universities, the council for skills formation and TAFE and the Australian Research Council, but also the council for language and literacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these five bodies have immensely important tasks and the areas to which they address themselves are immensely important for Australia, the coalition still believes that all five are too much in the pocket of the Minister of the day and overcontrolled by the bureaucracy. We would like to see NBEET, like its predecessors, the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, the Commonwealth Schools Commission and other bodies, have an integrity and independence of its own while recognising guidelines from the elected government and accepting the Budget decisions of the elected government but able, after consultation with all of the institutions involved, including associations of academics, researchers and students, to give an independent set of advice to the whole nation addressed through this Parliament to the government of the day. I believe that we are the losers because of that lack of independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NBEET was given minimal resources by the Australian Government under Minister Dawkins and his successors. I hope that those who will now carry out the review of NBEET will put their minds to the criteria that I have just addressed and which the Liberal and National parties have addressed over several years, to see that the outcome of this review will be an advisory mechanism in these five important areas which, in a coordinated way through such a board as NBEET, will be more achieving of those criteria that I have outlined than has been dismally the case over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Minister was aware that the deadline for review was coming up in June of 1993 but that he delayed setting up the review. I believe there is a spurious element in the statement that the Minister made. He said that as the coalition parties had a policy of abolishing NBEET because of the dissatisfaction which I have sought to express&mdash;and, I suppose, because of an estimation by the Government in the latter part of 1992 that there was some very good chance that we would soon be in government and in a position to put into effect that review&mdash;the review was therefore not really worth pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I believe that there was a second reason&mdash;and that is why I use the word `spurious'&mdash;which was that any review that was published before the election in March was likely to contain some earned criticism of the Government's arrangements and that criticism would have been reflected in the election debates about education, employment, training, skills formation, language, literacy and so on. Therefore, I believe that there was a degree of ducking by the Labor Government from having such a review on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be beneficial to the whole process that the legislation that is before us, which we support, contains an extension of the review period for another year to the end of June 1994. I hope that those given the responsibility for this review will carry out the review all the more objectively and inform the coalition, which has been rather sceptical of the strengths and achievements of NBEET and its subsidiary councils, and will be objective, direct and realistic about the shape that such advisory mechanisms ought to have in the continuing years to ensure that the question of resources is addressed. I have little more to say about the first of the two Bills. In a few minutes I will address the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that when the Australian Education Council or its equivalent, the Ministers responsible for TAFE and the Commonwealth Minister met to discuss the appointment of a chief executive officer for this new Australian National Training Authority, they wanted a particular person who they regarded as the best available to undertake this new task and to become the chief executive officer of ANTA. They could not immediately proceed to make that person's appointment because there is not the flexibility in the ANTA Act to allow the Commonwealth to remunerate the chosen one with equivalent salary and other conditions that he had in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak of Mr Terry Moran, whom I have not met. We are not in a position in the Senate to assess the appropriateness of his announced appointment. We know that, as he is the principal TAFE officer in Victoria, he has a salary of $170,000 or $180,000, which is many tens of thousands of dollars more than any Commonwealth public servant currently receives. Under Remuneration Tribunal guidelines, such a person would not be able to receive an equivalent salary under Commonwealth employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that many people not only in Victoria but in other States would look at the wage system of the Public Service in the State of Victoria and say, `How can it be that there is such a generous, systematic rate of salaries in the Victorian Public Service, which would appear to be way beyond the means of that State with its very sick economy?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or Defence. In fact, it is many tens of thousands of dollars more than any of the Ministers of this Government would receive in remuneration. It is that anomaly which we have to face in the amending Bill that is before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Opposition, I support this amendment and the ability to have flexibility in ANTA so that the secondment can happen according to what I believe is a unanimous decision of the Ministers of all governments&mdash;Labor and Liberal&mdash;including the Commonwealth Minister, who are involved in technical and further education. However, I will not let a moment pass to say that it is extraordinarily out of step for one State, at a time when there are one million people unemployed, to have what would appear to be such an overly generous rate of remuneration in the case of the Victorian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that we do give the present Government and our colleagues in all of the States the flexibility that is necessary, through the amendments proposed in this Bill, to allow that secondment&mdash;not only secondment at the CEO level but other secondments at other levels&mdash;in the ANTA bureaucracy to take place. I say `bureaucracy' not in a pejorative sense. I understand that there will be about 80 staff and they will be based in Brisbane. I see Senator Jones nodding across the way. I know that some people have criticised Brisbane as being out of the way. I do not. I believe that there are a number of national initiatives where there ought to be decentralisation of location such as to Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do put on the record again that we in the Opposition are not entirely happy with the concept of an Australian National Training Authority which is another layer removed from the teaching colleges of TAFE, the skills formation centres, the actual interface between those undertaking vocational and technical education around Australia. It will have to prove itself. It is too linked to a Commonwealth, national centralised overlayer of bureaucracy that may be too far away from the marketplace, too far away from the real employing firms to which graduates from these colleges would go and with too many layers of bureaucracy on bureaucracy. I hope that my fears will evaporate from the record that will be established right from the first day of January 1994 when ANTA is up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now put on the record my questions to the Minister. I would like to know the stage the Commonwealth and other Ministers from the States have reached in the formation of ANTA. When will the chief executive officer take office? When will the accommodation rented in Brisbane be filled? What are the steps administratively for gaining the full complement of staff over the next six months? Is the Minister confident that ANTA's planning will be on schedule and that its goals will be achieved? I am not only interested in the bureaucratic establishment of a secretariat; I am interested to see actual quality of outcome for what has been the Cinderella of education in Australia for the last decade and more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There do need to be more resources for TAFE, we do need to see a commitment to TAFE which is more commensurate with universities, and I believe that this is the outcome that we will be most looking to for the benefit of TAFE students in the years ahead. As I say, the Opposition supports the two Bills before us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us tonight two Bills&mdash;the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill and the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill&mdash;which are really just minor amendments to two pieces of government legislation or two programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I address my remarks firstly to the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill, which amends the principal Act by extending the deadline of the operations of NBEET to 30 June 1994, by which time a review of NBEET's operations can take place. The principal Act requires the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) to report to Parliament on the operations of the board before 1 July 1993. However, the Minister now seeks to extend this deadline on behalf of the board ostensibly because of the different election platforms of the old parties in relation to NBEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague has adopted a somewhat conspiratorial view of this reason&mdash;a view that I do not necessarily share. I guess we may never know the real reasons why NBEET has sought this particular extension of the review process. Nevertheless, we certainly know that NBEET has been very active in its reporting work. As we saw last week, some 10 reports were tabled, seven of which were dated 26 March 1993. So election or not, NBEET had certainly been a very busy organisation providing advice to the Minister and this Parliament. In the past, the Democrats have supported the existence of NBEET and I think that, on balance, the Democrats would view an increasingly national hand in education policy as a good thing. I think it is time we recognised that we are not a nation of six separate States plus a couple of Territories, but a single nation and it is appropriate to have a national education policy extending through the education system, including TAFE and the schools. In general it is to be supported that the Government has recognised that such a national approach is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone involved in academic research, I have viewed the activities of the Australian Research Council with some interest and will continue to do so. However, the Opposition has cast some doubts on whether NBEET can offer independent and realistic advice to the Minister. On balance we would say that it has, but our criticism of NBEET has been that too little input into the activities of NBEET and education policy in general is given to the Parliament. This is a very sad thing as it seems to me that NBEET has much more influence over what happens in education policy while the Parliament is simply given a few reports to examine for five minutes some months after they have been given to the Minister. It seems that the Parliament is simply picking up the crumbs of NBEET's work and is having a very second-hand look at what it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very sorry that we will not have an opportunity to examine this review until 12 months time because, of course, I will not be here then and I will not get a chance to be a part of the debate that will doubtless occur in relation to the report when it is tabled in the Parliament. However, I would hope that a review of NBEET would substantially shake up the national education bureaucracy. That would be a good thing. Bringing some new blood into the education bureaucracy would likewise be a good thing, and NBEET needs to know that this Parliament does have a role in scrutinising its activities and it cannot simply go off and produce reports and expect us to rubber stamp its policy making activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, it would be unfortunate if a review of NBEET produced no changes and no review of the way it operates&mdash;especially in relation to the Australian Research Council, as I know that there are academics who have some serious concerns about the way the council is operating. Those are some issues that I will continue to pursue through the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training over the next couple of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill, I am amazed that, less than six months after having passed the principal Act, we are once again tidying up a piece of government legislation that should have been drafted properly in the first place. This is not the first time I have asked&mdash;and I know that a number of other senators have likewise raised similar concerns&mdash;why the Government did not get it right when the principal Act was presented in December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support ANTA and its broad aims, but we do have some concerns about its operation. We have concerns that it will add another layer of bureaucracy and that it may, as a statutory authority, get somewhat out of control. I will raise some of those issues later. For that reason, the Democrats have decided that we will be looking to have put into place some kind of review of ANTA's activities towards the end of next year so that there can be some scrutiny to ensure that ANTA is actually performing the role for which it was designed. Doubtless my colleagues will be moving on that issue towards the end of 1994. I know that the coalition likewise shares these concerns, and the general broad review of the operation of statutory authorities is an issue that has been raised by a number of senators in this place, regardless of their party affiliation. Certainly in respect of ANTA, I think it is right and proper that this Parliament should undertake some long-term scrutiny of whether it is fulfilling its charter, and review the work that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in the Bill before us tonight spell out the staffing secondment provisions. Specifically, the first amendment allows for the secondment of a chief executive officer. Currently the Act provides for the appointment of a  chief executive officer, but not a secondment. As the board has agreed to this amendment, it has selected the inaugural chief executive officer to be Mr Terry Moran, a senior Victorian public servant, again a person of whom I have no knowledge and about whom I make no comment. I trust that ANTA has made a wise choice, and I wish Mr Moran all the best in his future with this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for the secondment of staff other than the chief executive officer. They allow the authority to make secondment arrangements with State and Territory authorities. We accept that the establishment of ANTA has been long overdue. It has certainly taken a long time for the Government to realise that it has national responsibilities in the TAFE area. Certainly the establishment of ANTA should have happened some time ago. Be that as it may, after ten years, the Government having fiddled with the university sector of higher education, it has now turned its eyes towards the training sector in order to adopt a national approach, which we believe is a good move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However we must be wary, in our view, of hasty movements on this project, nor should we be too quick in our selection of bureaucrats or senior public servants to run this authority. I would hope that ANTA does not just become another arm of DEET, as Senator Teague has suggested is currently the case with NBEET&mdash;although we may differ on that particular point. It is important that ANTA, as a statutory authority, does remain an independent body and does not simply become the hand maiden of DEET or of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some concerns raised about the membership of ANTA, and Senator Teague has suggested that ANTA may not be responsive enough to the needs of industry because it is another layer of bureaucracy seeking to have input into the training agenda. I would suggest that there are a lot of people in higher education circles who believe that ANTA could be too much in the pocket of industry. We need to look at some of the membership of ANTA, which includes Mr Brian Finn from IBM; Ms Anne Rein from Tourism Training Australia; Mr Michael Deeley, formerly from ICI; Mr Stuart Hornery from Lend Lease; and Mr Bill Mansfield, Assistant Secretary of the ACTU. These five members have been appointed for three years by the Governor-General. I would ask the Minister and the Government, where are the representatives of those who are actually delivering education?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very industry driven organisation. As I said in my speech last week on the NBEET report related to competency based training, I believe in five years time we will actually be having a good look at the amendments and the changes that have occurred on the training agenda this year and last year, and recognise that the agenda we are now putting in place is far too industry driven. We have lost what it means to have a good broad general education, where that fits into the training agenda and how that should be delivered. I just signal that note of warning. I know that there are many organisations that share this concern. Certainly the Australian Council of Professions is very upset and concerned about this new agenda. They have suggested likewise that ANTA and policy in this area is very much being driven by industry with little input from professional associations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Council of Professions, in particular, has raised this issue not only in relation to the membership of ANTA constituting the five people I have mentioned earlier but also in relation to the industry training bodies which are now under the authority of ANTA. They have suggested that there is a much wider agenda at work here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not one generally into conspiracy theories, but I have got some information here which suggests that there are some concerns that the ITABs will seek to exercise more influence over the education of professionals in a range of areas than has been the case in the past. Professionals believe&mdash;this is an area that the Higher Education Council looked at in its advice to NBEET&mdash;that issues such as competency based training are not as applicable to a professional education as they are to training for vocations. I think there is some merit to those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be very concerned if ANTA, whose charter and responsibility relate solely to vocational education and training, if one reads the principal Act, sought to extend its tentacles to have some influence and control over the education of professionals through university degrees. I had a look at the ANTA principal Act tonight before coming into the chamber, and I saw that there was nothing in that legislation that related to universities, to degrees or to professional education; it all related to vocational education and training. Yet we see that the mission statement of the health industry training body seeks to `develop national policy for the industries which will encourage curriculum development, ensure articulation of training, identify competency standards and improve the quality of education and training provided through workplaces, TAFE colleges, universities and other providers'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have an organisation, an ITAB connected with ANTA, for which ANTA has responsibility, seeking to have some influence over universities and education policy developed for health education providers. I signal that note of warning. I am not suggesting that there is any major conspiracy at work here, but the Australian National Training Authority has been established as a body to deal with vocational education and training in Australia. If there is some wider agenda to ensure that it has some wider input into a university education and to training as it relates to professional degrees, then it should say so, the Minister should say so, and it should be included in the charter of ANTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That being the case, our professional organisations should have some say into how to relate issues of competency  based training for professional degrees and so forth. Those are issues that NBEET is trying to grapple with at the moment. I would hate to see ANTA escape the net of that scrutiny and simply run off and develop policy in relation to professional education without anyone really having a great deal of say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to seeing greater scrutiny of ANTA by the Senate Committee on Employment Education and Training in the next 18 months. I think it is right and proper that parliamentary committees be given a wider charter to assess the work done by statutory authorities. I am sure that, given the support that ANTA has amongst State training Ministers, it will do the job it has been designed to do. I certainly hope that for the sake of training in this country it does, and can do, the job of developing a national training policy and ensuring that national standards, national curricula, and national competency based standards are developed in the best interests of students and industry in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(9.19 p.m.)&mdash;The Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1993 and the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1993, which are before the Senate tonight, are not controversial in nature but deal with two organisations with which the Opposition has a number of concerns. The purpose of the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1993 is to allow ANTA to appoint as Chief Executive Officer, a person seconded from a Commonwealth, State or Territory public service authority. The original ANTA Bill provided for the secondment of other staff but not for the secondment of the Chief Executive Officer from the public sector. ANTA recruited publicly and chose Mr Terry Moran, a senior Victorian public servant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Moran was earning $170,000, it was felt that he could not be expected to drop down to $120,000, the salary of a Commonwealth departmental secretary. Because the Government wants the best man for the job, it would seem reasonable that the CEO of ANTA be adjusted to allow for the employment of Mr Moran, and thus the Opposition will not oppose the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean that the potential problems associated with the establishment of ANTA have disappeared. The new CEO will certainly have his work cut out for him. Questions must be raised about whether a centralised national governing body for vocational education and training is close enough to the coalface to be responsive to local needs. It is essential for vocational education and training in Australia to be flexible and responsive to the needs of the local community and local industry. A large central bureaucracy in Brisbane, overseeing the implementation of a national agenda, will only hinder that responsiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA must ensure that it maintains a light, coordinating role between the vocational education systems from State to State and even within each State. To ensure that ANTA is working properly it must be watched carefully, especially during its initial stages. Concerns raised by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training during its review of the legislation to set up ANTA included: the problems of bureaucracy and centralism, the danger posed by the State training profile process, and the seeming lack of industry consultation in setting up ANTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is going to review ANTA at the end of this year, after ANTA has created its initial establishment and worked out its initial charter, and before it gets too far into the business of having the whole system up and running. A serious review at that stage is necessary to ensure that the whole process stays on the rails. It is absolutely essential that a body such as ANTA avoids excessive bureaucracy and allows the existing State agencies to respond flexibly to local needs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is Brisbane. I simply add that I look forward to the review of ANTA. The purpose of the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill 1993&mdash;the second Bill before us tonight&mdash;is to extend the deadline for review of the operation of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, NBEET, its councils and consultative committees until 30 June 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is really a most disappointing turn of events. NBEET was due for review on 30 June 1993 but, with an election pending and an unambiguous policy announcement by the coalition to abolish NBEET, the Government decided to defer determination of the terms of reference of the review and the selection of a person to undertake it until after the election. In view of the deferral and the Government's conclusion that an adequate review could not be established and completed in the period prescribed by the Act, it sought an extension of the review period. The coalition is not opposed to an extension but we do find the delay unfortunate because the structure of NBEET is such that it largely overlaps with things that should be provided by other government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board was established to inquire into, and provide information and advice to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on, matters relating to employment, youth affairs, education, training, research, and other portfolio issues referred to it by the Minister. The board also integrates the operational advice of four statutory councils and one non-statutory council. The councils are: the Australian Language and Literacy Council, the Australian Research Council, the Employment and Skills Formation Council, the Higher Education Council and the Schools Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question which needs to be asked is why the Minister needs additional bureaucracy when he has a whole department and ministerial staff to look at the issues which are being raised in the employment and education areas. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 31 March 1993, Graeme Leech said that this review had the potential to overhaul the relationship between the Australian Research Council and the Higher Education Council, which could lead to a merger of the two bodies. I think the coalition would welcome such an approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect of NBEET that should be reviewed is the operation of the Employment and Skills Formation Council. The coalition has been concerned with an apparent overlap of responsibility between this council and ANTA. I welcome comments from the chairwoman of the Schools Council, Ms Ann Morrow, who has said that the review of her council should be as rigorous as possible and be conducted by someone experienced in evaluation who could provide potential pointers on increased efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the chairman of NBEET, Mr Peter Laver, has commented that he would recommend to the Minister a deferral of six months to a year and that he was promoting an early review because he was anxious for an independent assessment of NBEET's role. I agree with Mr Laver that an early review is necessary, and whilst I acknowledge that NBEET does undertake some important work, these functions can be undertaken more efficiently through the structure proposed by the coalition before the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is why the Government did not agree with Mr Laver and why the extension of the review under this amendment is for one year as opposed to the six months that Mr Laver wanted. It is disappointing that the review has been delayed, because the sooner we have a review of NBEET and its functions the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak specifically on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 1993. I fully endorse the remarks of my colleague Senator Tierney in relation to some of the issues that have arisen in relation to this new authority. The focus of my remarks will be specifically directed to the secondment of a new chief executive of ANTA. My colleague in the other place, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), has drawn attention to the fact that this amendment was required to allow the new chief executive, a gentleman by the name of Mr Terry Moran, to have a salary in the order of $170,000, rather than the limit of $120,000 which was placed on his appointment as a result of his not being able to be seconded from the Victorian Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the issue of salaries that the Commonwealth Government is paying to chief executives. This major issue has occurred as a result of the Government's need&mdash;I think an appropriate need&mdash;for salary and wage restraint in other sectors of the economy. One of the issues that has emerged in relation to the payments to senior public servants is the issue of performance based pay. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), who is at the table, may be able to indicate whether Mr Moran will be coming under this scheme of performance based bonuses. I would like to explore this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 July this year the Senior Executive Service of the Public Service will be entitled to very substantial bonuses as a result of the performance based system that was agreed between the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, and Jenny George of the ACTU last December. It is interesting that the ACTU was involved in this. I am at a loss to understand why it agreed to very substantial effective pay rises as a result of the performance based pay system to senior public servants, while at the same time insisting on pay restraint by lower paid workers in the public and private sectors. It is an important issue that has started to emerge in the press, and I hope the Minister may be able to tell us whether Mr Moran is entitled to these performance based pay arrangements, and whether this will act as a pacesetter for the Public Service and public authorities. </PARA>

As Senator Carr would probably remind me, the Government promised the workers of Australia prior to the last election that 1 July would be the day when they would be receiving their $8 a week pay rise. That has now been put on the backburner. On 1 July, all the Senior Executive Service will be entitled to be assessed for performance based pay rises. This may involve a cash bonus of up to $15,000 to the top levels of the Senior Executive Service. That is for people regarded as a `five' performer. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five divisions in the performance based pay scale. Some of the members of the Senior Executive Service after 1 July will become eligible for this $15,000 pay increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill before us highlights some of the problems that the Government now has in the industrial relations area, particularly in relation to wages and salaries. Whereas I may not agree with Senator Carr on many issues, I wonder whether in this climate of restraint this sort of salary package is appropriate for the Commonwealth Government to be setting&mdash;a further pacesetter. Because of the procedures that the Commonwealth Government has adopted, with the endorsement of the ACTU&mdash;let us be blunt on that&mdash;performance based pay rises will be very substantial indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of important issues are raised by this Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I found the dialogue that Senator Kemp had with Senator Carr fascinating, especially as it was only one way. I say to Senator Carr, `You have got him spooked already'. We have had several contributions tonight. Not many of the contributions spent a long time on the actual Bills before us&mdash;the Employment, Education and Training Amendment Bill and the Australian National Training Amendment Bill&mdash;but the opportunity has been used to raise general attitudes on the effectiveness of the ANTA board and also NBEET. The general comments reflected people's views as they have previously expressed them. I will not respond to those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague asked five specific questions not related to the Bill. I do not think he expects me to respond on the spot, but I have asked the officers to write to him by Friday with answers to those five questions. I do not deem it necessary for those answers to be cleared by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley); so we should get them to him by Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague was a little cynical when he said that this was put off maybe for other reasons other than an upcoming election and a possible coalition win. Maybe he is right; maybe none of us thought they could win. But he is wrong when he says that we did not have the inquiry because we thought we might be embarrassed during the federal election by the results of the inquiry. We are skilled enough to hold an inquiry and have the results come after an election rather  than before. I think that rather detracts from that particular conspiracy theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that some of the advice&mdash;I cannot say this with absolute authority&mdash;from the department would have been, `Look, you are setting up terms of reference for an inquiry. We have to remind you that in a few months or in a few weeks time you will be in caretaker mode. We have examined the Opposition policy and it is quite diametrically opposed to this and it would be a waste of resources to set up an inquiry and appoint an inquirer if there is a change of government. You might want to go in a completely different direction'. I think generally it is a fairly genuine attitude in this regard to have put it off. As Senator Teague has said, away from the atmosphere of partisan politics in this next year the review may be even more wide ranging than before because at least there are no political imperatives to be met over the next year in the electoral process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague went on to make a rather anguished cry about relative wage justice. All I can say is that he will not find much disagreement with me on what he has said. It is very hard to find comparative wage justice in terms of executive salaries. Recently the managing director of AMP got a $130,000 pay rise after a rather unsuccessful year in running the company. That is double Senator Teague's salary in one salary rise, let alone the quantum, which is of the order of $800,000. Many people in this chamber have spoken on the lack of restraint in executive salaries. However, I do not think we can resolve all those issues here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not just the Commonwealth Minister but the Commonwealth ministerial council wanted this particular individual. Again, he was not known to me&mdash;he is apparently known to no-one in the chamber, but that is not surprising. It was their decision. It was found that, due to the provisions of a previous Act, it was not possible to second this person and, therefore, the adjustments have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sowada made a more general contribution. I stopped listening when she told us that she was not into conspiracy theories. I was a bit stunned by that so I did not take in the rest of her contribution. Senator Tierney made a very succinct contribution tonight&mdash;he hid all the major points and did not repeat himself over and over again. I thought it was quite a good contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kemp complained that someone is being paid more than Commonwealth department heads. At the Estimates committee hearing I expressed some surprise at that. I remind Senator Kemp that the Kennett Government negotiated this contract. This contract was negotiated on 1 January. The Kennett Government determined the salary of $170,000 a year plus extras. The State Liberal governments have been the major pacesetters in executive salaries. The head of the Victorian Education Department gets $250,000 a year. There is at least one public servant in Victoria, I understand, who is on $300,000 a year. All this started with the Greiner Liberal government in New South Wales. It changed the name from that of secretary of department to chief executive officer and offered enormous salary packages in an attempt to steal public servants away from Canberra. And now we are into the rat-race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is anomalous that someone with 80 bureaucrats working under him is getting paid $40,000 more than my departmental secretary who has at least 23,000 civilians working under him. My CDF, who has 68,000 people working under him, gets far less salary than someone with 80 bureaucrats working under him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating tonight the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 1992. Briefly, in January 1990 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act was amended by the Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Act to allow for the president of the tribunal to be responsible for managing the administrative affairs of the tribunal. Following the commencement of separate administration, it was agreed that the operations of the tribunal should be reviewed to assess the delivery of services, efficiency and so on. However, the review was deferred at that time until the new president, Justice O'Connor, had the opportunity of familiarising herself with the operations of the tribunal. She was appointed in June 1990, and the review took place between October 1990 and November 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A series of amendments is proposed which basically seeks to do eight things. The amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the tribunal and clarifying the powers of the tribunal in procedural matters. I will briefly refer to the eight matters that are dealt with: firstly, a clearer statement of the president's role and functions; secondly, two additional methods by which the tribunal can be constituted; thirdly, an application is not validly lodged unless the prescribed fee is actually paid; fourthly, formal recognition for directions hearings; fifthly, a discretion to determine whether or not a conference should be held; sixthly, a discretion for the tribunal to decline to make a decision in terms of an agreement that the parties might come to; seventh, participation in proceedings by means of closed circuit television and any other means of communication; and, eighth, the power to dismiss applications for delay or where the application is frivolous or vexatious. </PARA>

However, it is worth mentioning that one of my colleagues who will participate in the debate later this evening has had a significant role to play and a significant interest in the development of the tribunal. He is one of the few remaining people who were here when the tribunal was set up and who had something to say about what the Bill that would set up the tribunal offered and did not offer and who had something to say when the Bill needed amendment. He has had a close interest in those matters ever since. I am referring to Senator Durack, from Western Australia, who is retiring at the end of June. He has served in numerous capacities in this Parliament, not the least of which was as Attorney-General. I think this Bill was first passed in 1975. </PARA>

Senator Durack took the opportunity to say that what was wrong with the Bill was what had been pointed out originally but that the Government would not listen and that now we were in government we would make amendments to fix those problems.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate today is debating the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 1992. The purpose of this Bill, as has already been stated, is to give effect to recommendations of the report of the review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to make specific provision for mediation and to provide that the tribunal is able to accept documents lodged by electronic means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendments in this Bill, which implement the review's recommendations, are firstly, a clearer statement of the role and functions of the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to the arrangement of business and the personnel of the tribunal; secondly, the provision of a discretion in the president to convene a preliminary conference to determine the matters in issue prior to a hearing&mdash;this implements what has already become practice of convening such conferences where a significant proportion of cases are resolved&mdash;thirdly, provision of a discretion for the tribunal to decline to make a decision in terms of the parties' agreement if it is inappropriate to do so; and, fourthly, to introduce a power to dismiss applications for delay if they are frivolous or vexatious. The Government says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . such matters, although few in number, are very resource intensive and divert resources away from legitimate applications.</PARA>
<PARA>I too look forward to the comments that we can expect from Senator Durack on this matter, which he has obviously researched to a great extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also introduces mediation in the AAT as an alternative to formal hearings in order to provide a greater choice of methods of dispute resolution in a manner similar to the legislative framework for mediation-arbitration which is in use now in the federal and family courts. Mediation will, however, not be used where the president considers that the matter in dispute is of sufficient public importance for a decision to be made by the tribunal on the merits of the case or where there is such a degree of animosity between the parties that mediation would be inhibited. Finally, the Bill proposes to allow the tribunal to accept documents lodged by electronic means&mdash;a move which is certainly to be welcomed. The Australian Democrats will be supporting this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had hoped that tonight perhaps we would have had more time to debate these amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act because, although the amendments in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill are not extensive, they do make some important changes to the administration of the Act, and in that regard they are most welcome. I am pleased that the debate in this chamber indicates that they will be passed without dissent or amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like to take the opportunity, albeit a somewhat attenuated one now under the pressure of time in this chamber this evening, to say a few things about the creation and the progress of this most revolutionary change in the public administration of Australia&mdash;a change which I hope will be implemented in all States of Australia in due course. It has been followed in some States but has yet to be followed in others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic reform created by the establishment of an administrative appeals tribunal was to give individuals affected by administrative decisions of government&mdash;in this case of the Commonwealth&mdash;a right of appeal to an independent or external review body. When this was first considered by a committee set up in the late 1960s, there were very limited areas of government where the decisions of a Minister or departmental official, apart from some internal review processes perhaps, could be reviewed by an external body. There has been great debate not only in the country but in other similar jurisdictions about the lack of rights of an individual against government decisions whereas individuals affected by the decisions of other individuals, large corporations or whatever have had rights of redress in   the   ordinary court   system.   When</PARA>
<PARA>individuals' rights were affected by decisions of government&mdash;these are largely whether the Government's discretion was exercised in a justifiable way, not whether the Government was acting legally&mdash;there was no similar redress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been a great pioneer in providing redress for individuals against claimed infringement of their rights by others&mdash;whether they be government, other individuals or major institutional bodies. Over a century ago, the Australian conciliation and arbitration system was introduced. When it was established it was hailed as a new province of law and order. Although many changes are now being made to that system, and many more will be made, I think it is fair to say that the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 1 July 1976 was hailed as a new province of law and order for Australia. Indeed, the way in which this system has flourished in the past 17 years indicates that it is an extremely vigorous and successful teenager. I am sure it will go on for easily as long as the arbitration system has existed, and probably longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal was set up as a result of bipartisan actions through this Parliament. As I said, the original committee, which proposed a body of this kind, was set up by a Liberal government. The legislation, when finally brought into this Parliament in 1975, was brought in by a Labor government. The legislation was welcomed by the then Opposition, of which I was a member. We found some very grave deficiencies at the time in that legislation. The legislation set up the shell structure of an appeals tribunal but did not give the tribunal any jurisdiction. It was in the process of the debate in this chamber on the original Bill that the tribunal was granted a wide and special jurisdiction which enabled the tribunal when it was first established to rapidly obtain a very substantial workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, that jurisdiction has been greatly widened, and is widened almost continuously in legislation dealt with in this chamber and probably unnoticed by most of us. The body itself has certainly become of major significance in what I would call broadly our judicial system or rule of law. It has led to the creation of a number of specific administrative appeals tribunals, some of which are overseen by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Others have their own independent life, such as the migration review tribunals. All in all what this legislation has led to is a major change in the way in which the public administration of the Commonwealth goes about making its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this relatively short period of 17 years, it has led to some very major changes in the practices and the better performance of the public administration in Australia, and the Public Service of the Commonwealth in particular. I would have liked to have elaborated somewhat more on that, but I just refer to the fact that a few weeks ago I attended a conference in Canberra put on by the Australian Institute of Administrative Law and the Royal Institute of Public Administration of Australia. It was very well attended, largely by public servants, but others such as myself were there. The most pleasing aspect of that conference was the extent to which the administrative appeals system of administrative review in Australia has been accepted and become part and parcel of the culture of public administration. It has been a most successful and welcome development. As I said, I foresee it being not only part of the architecture of administration but retained as a vital feature of our public administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the way in which the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been structured. When I talk about the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, I should speak generally of these other bodies associated with it, either subject to appeal to it or existing in their own independent right. There is a major philosophy behind the structure of these bodies. They are separate from the judicial traditional court system within our legal system, or rule of law. There are appeals to the courts on points of law and lawyers, and in some cases judges, have played a role and will continue to play a role as presiding members of many of the tribunals, certainly those dealing with the more difficult areas of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing&mdash;this was applied from the very beginning in the original Act and is still a major feature&mdash;is that it is simply not a lawyer's paradise or a lawyer's monopoly.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The tribunals have been structured in such a way that some may be presided over by lawyers, sitting in many cases with experts in the various fields that are covered under the appeal, whether that be in taxation, customs, veterans' affairs, social security or whatever the area may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunals are tailored to deal with a particular area of administration and appeals are heard by people who would be qualified in that area. At a time when a good deal of criticism is being made of our ordinary judicial system and many people are talking about the sorts of reforms that should be made to it, it is pleasing to note that this system of broad right of appeal against administrative decisions&mdash;which we have had now for the past 17 years&mdash;has been reflecting, and will continue to reflect, means and methods of giving citizens the right of appeal with minimum legal formalities using a combination of legal and other diverse skills which people in the community can contribute to bring about the solution of these conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution of conflicts is a major role of government; it is a major part of a democratic and free society. The rights of the individual should always be paramount, but it is how we give effect to them that is perhaps more difficult to achieve. I believe our administrative appeals system has been highly successful in achieving those goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill adds further to that progress by acknowledging  the alternative dispute resolution system, as it is called&mdash;namely, the opportunities for mediation or arbitration of disputes and, in particular, the encouragement of settlement of disputes. These have always been part and parcel of our judicial system. Nevertheless, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, despite all its informality and wider representation of interests than would be available to the court system&mdash;apart altogether from the use of juries in that system&mdash;has not yet had the opportunity of exploring other new dispute resolution methods such as mediation and encouraging parties to settle their disputes. That does seem to create some difficulty for appeals against decisions by administrators under legal discretions. But I cannot see any reason why those methods should not be just as available in these cases as they are in our ordinary legal system. I am sure these new proposals will fit in very well with the greater informality of a tribunal based system as opposed to a court system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another feature of our established system is that a wide pool of people, including lawyers, have participated in it and have been members of the tribunal. I think the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, who wants to widen the selection pool for the court system, might profit by looking at the way in which people have been selected to serve on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. There is&mdash;and I noticed it particularly at this conference&mdash;a great opportunity for women who have played, are playing, and will continue to play, a major role in the work of this appeals system, both with regard to the tribunal itself and similar tribunals operating under its umbrella. I welcome the introduction of this Bill and look forward to its speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to speak on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Bill 1992 [1993], and I will only do so for a very short time. I thought it appropriate to acknowledge in a bipartisan way the great contribution which Senator Durack has made to the development of this area of Australia's public life. When inhabitants of this great Commonwealth are affected by a decision taken by a Commonwealth department or agency, or by any decision maker, which can affect their enjoyment of life&mdash;or access even to a livelihood by way of a licence that could be granted by some Commonwealth agency&mdash;then it is extremely important that the decision maker be subject to scrutiny and judgment, and that the person affected know that any grievance will be looked at in a fair way. As Senator Durack pointed out, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in its various forms and subsets, has been a very important safeguard for Australians against the kind of arbitrary or partial decision-making that can have such an adverse effect on a person's life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to acknowledge the contribution which Senator Durack has made to the evolution of the system. He spoke modestly&mdash;almost as though he were a mere observer&mdash;of the genesis and birth of this particular Administrative Appeals Tribunal process. Of course, he was more than an observer; he was a very active participant. Much of his creative work as a member of the Liberal Party in this Parliament&mdash;in opposition and in government&mdash;and particularly as Attorney-General, will be found in the contribution he has made to this area of decision making within the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Durack also mentioned that the scope for women to participate in the tribunal indicates a way in which decision making tribunals might be better constituted to serve Australian society. This particular organisation, which is only 17 years old, has the capacity to be innovative, not only with regard to the development of alternative dispute resolution processes, but also with regard to the personnel of which it is formed. In many different and perhaps unexpected ways, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is part of Australia's pre-eminent contribution to the protection of citizens against arbitrary or partial decisions of governments, which is acknowledged internationally as of worldwide significance. I believe that the tribunal has much to commend it. In so far as its genesis enjoyed the support and encouragement of Senator Durack, it is appropriate in the course of this debate to pay him tribute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will concentrate my remarks on the Social Security Amendment Bill 1993, while my colleague the shadow Minister for veterans' affairs, Senator MacGibbon, will concentrate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill. This Bill seeks to facilitate three of the Government's masses of election promises, namely a reduction in the withdrawal rate under the age pension assets test, an extension of the income free area for jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance and the rationalisation of the normal waiting period for these three benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with all the Government's pre-election promises, each of these initiatives will have an impact on the Government's Budget outcome. When the Budget comes out I will be interested to see how the Government is going to pay for those promises. It is estimated that these measures will cost some $71.6 million in 1993-94 and $90.6 million in 1994-95. In the light of these not insignificant costs it is important that these measures are given careful consideration by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill will amend the Social Security Act by introducing an additional free area of $30 a fortnight in earned income for single recipients of jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance, while the additional free area for earned income for partnered recipients of these benefits will be increased by $20&mdash;from $30 to $50 a fortnight. An estimated 89,000 benefit recipients will be affected by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative means that single people on the dole will be able to earn an additional $30 a fortnight from working before their rate of payment is reduced. A partnered person on the dole will be able to earn up to $50 a fortnight from working before his rate of payment is reduced. This earned income, or in layman's terms earnings from work&mdash;this free area&mdash;is in addition to the basic free area of $60 per fortnight which applies to ordinary income from any source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also amends the Social Security Act by consolidating all the current normal waiting period exemption provisions for jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance into a single across-the-board exemption that applies to anyone who has been in receipt of income support within the previous 13 weeks. According to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) in the House of Representatives, these provisions will `improve the financial return from undertaking part-time or casual employment and reduce client uncertainty about the effects of such employment on future entitlements'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition obviously supports the social security income test and a system of waiting period exemptions that provide the unemployed with a greater incentive to undertake part-time and casual work. Far too frequently in this country we hear people claiming that it is pointless working because they can do as well from being on the dole. Such an attitude should not be tolerated or encouraged; nor should a social security system engender that attitude. It is a fact of life under the economic policies of this Government that neither the public nor the private sector is able to generate anywhere near enough full-time jobs to overcome our massive jobless problem. It is also a fact, for a variety of reasons, not least the huge costs entailed in employing people on a full-time basis, that many employers are relying more and more on part-time and casual employees. The coalition believes that if someone who would otherwise be unemployed, can obtain work on a part time or casual basis, he or she should not be disadvantaged for doing so by the social security income test or any waiting period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, unemployed people should be actively encouraged to maintain links with both the paid and the unpaid work forces because such links are often vital to their later full-time, paid employment prospects, opportunities for references and other things that we all understand people need if they go into full-time employment, as well as the importance it has for their own self-esteem. For this reason, the coalition is supporting both of these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also be stressed that part-time and casual work, whilst important, particularly for women, is not the panacea to our jobless problem. The massive underemployment rates we have witnessed over the last three years show that hundreds of thousands of people who are now working part-time or in casual employment would like to work more hours a week. The Government should not forget that the vast majority of people still want full-time work and they are entitled to get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third Government promise contained in this Bill is the lowering of the pension withdrawal rate for pensioners with assets about the assets test threshold for the full-rate pension. Currently, the pension is reduced by $26 per year for every $250 of excess assets about the full-rate assets threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under these new provisions, commencing on 20 September, a person's pension will be reduced by $19.50 per year for every $250 of excess assets. This is a 25 per cent reduction in the assets test withdrawal rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lowering the assets test withdrawal rate means that some current pensioners will be eligible for higher part-pensions, while others who previously were not eligible for any pension will become eligible for a part-pension. The department estimates that another 8,400 non-pensioner retirees and 1,300 other people will be eligible for the pension for the first time as a result of this initiative. A further 39,100 current pensioners will get an increase in their part-pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this initiative because, to an extent, it belatedly addresses the financial problems faced by retirees on very low fixed incomes who are disqualified from the pension due to the assets test. These retirees have received very little assistance from the current Government over the last three years, while their fixed incomes have dropped drastically due to falling interest rates. They continue to pay tax on any income they earn above $5,400 a year while pensioners with higher net incomes enjoy the benefits of the pensioner rebate. They continue to be ineligible for a wide range of fringe benefits that are valued at an estimated $1,500 per annum. If some of these retirees become eligible for the pension for the first time as a result of this initiative, the coalition certainly does not begrudge them that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a word of warning for these first time pensioners. It is now obvious that the Government has hopelessly under-funded its fringe benefits extension promise. At this stage, it is totally up in the air whether this extension will be able to continue beyond 30 June this year. A further increase in the pensioner population as a result of a lower assets test withdrawal rate will put even more financial pressure on this government promise. It would be appreciated if the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) could put pensioners at ease by committing his Government to continuing to provide 100 per cent compensation to the States beyond 30 June for this fringe benefits extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we welcome this initiative, the opportunity cannot pass without highlighting the Government's proposed inequitable treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares compared with other pensioner investments. Take an example of two pensioners with equal income and assets. Both exceed the income and assets test full-pension thresholds. One of these pensioners has an investment in real estate, the other has an investment in shares. Both investments make an unrealised capital gain of $5,000 over a 12-month period. In neither case does the unrealised gain take the pensioner over the income or assets test part-pension threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pensioner with the real estate suffers a reduction in pension of $390 a year as a result of a reassessment under the new pensioner assets test. In practice, this is probably a worst case scenario because a pensioner in this situation is likely not to be reassessed under the assets test at all. However, the pensioner with $5,000 unrealised capital gain on his share portfolio suffers a pension reduction of $2,500 a year. This is because, as the legislation currently stands, as at September his unrealised capital gain will be treated as income under the pensioner income test. As he is over the full-pension income threshold, 50c in every dollar of this $5,000 unrealised capital gain is taken out of his or her pension. And the Minister has the gall to claim that treating unrealised capital gains on shares as income will mean a more equitable means testing system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just one of the numerous inequities, anomalies and poverty traps in the current social security incomes and assets test system that resulted in the coalition committing itself in Fightback to a thorough review of the current means testing procedures for pensioners. Whilst it is a beneficial initiative, lowering the assets test withdrawal rate is really just another example of the Government tinkering at the edges but not having the courage to foster a comprehensive and open debate on pensioner means testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of reasoned decision making, I am sure the Minister would assist my colleagues and me by informing the Senate how the Government settled upon the $19.50 withdrawal rate figure. I foreshadow that the Opposition will be moving a second reading amendment condemning the Government for its failure to address the special needs of the unemployed and the aged. I also foreshadow that in the committee stage I will be moving an amendment which will, in essence, repeat the amendment I put forward in the private member's Bill last week, which was supported by the Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Amendment Bill and the Veterans Affairs' Legislation Amendment Bill before us tonight will not be opposed by the Australian Democrats. They contain positive measures, which we welcome. In fact, we have been calling for the introduction of some of these measures for quite a considerable time. The actions that are now being taken by the Government certainly vindicate our stance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, we welcome the move in the Social Security Amendment Bill 1993 to permit single people receiving the jobstart, newstart or sickness allowances to earn an additional $30 a fortnight from employment before their payment is affected. The Democrats have been calling for increases in these three areas across a range of pensions for quite some time. The inadequacy of these areas has been a major barrier to part-time and casual employment. It is extremely important that those who are unemployed have the option, if it presents itself, to take up part-time and casual work to keep their skills and their self-esteem, as well as to earn those additional few dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are very pleased tonight to see that the Government has finally taken some action on this matter. It is really disgraceful that it has taken so long to do something about it because virtually every welfare and charitable organisation in this country has been calling for this measure as well. The Democrats have been telling the Government for the past three years that this needed to be done but until now the Government has done absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats also welcome the new provisions which mean that people claiming jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowances will not have to serve the ordinary one-week waiting period if they have been in receipt of income support within the previous 13 weeks. Again this is a long overdue and welcome measure. For years unemployed people have been discouraged from taking on short-term employment because they cannot afford the loss of income involved in going through yet another waiting period at the end of the job. I do not know how many times I have stood up in here and called on the Government to do something about waiting periods. It has been blatantly obvious, and apparent to everybody except the Government, that waiting periods are a major contributor to hardship. The Salvation Army, St Vincent De Paul or Adelaide Central Mission will all state that many people they support are in fact eligible for social security payments but are serving some sort of waiting period or other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of moving to reduce or abolish waiting periods, in recent years this Government has actually increased waiting periods and dreamed up a few new ones to introduce. Time and time again I have sat in this chamber and listened to the Government trying to justify its refusal to reduce waiting periods. There has certainly been a wide variety of excuses. Meanwhile, unemployed Australians and their families have continued to suffer. So I say a rather belated congratulations of sorts to the Government for finally waking up and taking some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be moving amendments to abolish another waiting period, the 12-week wait for those unemployed persons who allegedly reduce their employment prospects by moving to a different area, although we will be doing this without much hope. We have tried to do so before and have not been successful, but we do want to make the point again that this is yet another major hole in our social security net through which many people fall. It means that people cannot travel to look for work and take the risks. It means that people, particularly those who have been long-term unemployed, cannot take options in rural parts of Australia for cheaper housing. In my State in particular I emphasise moving to places such as Millicent where housing trust accommodation is often available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rule makes it extremely difficult for DSS to deal constructively with unemployed people who are highly mobile. It also makes it virtually impossible for unemployed people, especially those with families, to move to areas where living costs such as housing are cheaper but, by the Government's definition, unemployment prospects might be slightly worse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the labour market has deteriorated considerably since the introduction of this rule and it is no longer appropriate, if it were ever appropriate, for this rule to be in place. Senator Bolkus indicated to the Senate late last year that DSS and DEET were going to have another look at this reduced employment prospects rule and that the Government was going to report back around April. I take this opportunity to ask the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson): at what stage is that report? When will we be seeing it? If we could have a look at it before the Budget session it would certainly help us to see what the Government is thinking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. Again, the Democrats support this piece of legislation. We are pleased to see the reduction in the assets test withdrawal rate. We also support the extension of coverage under the Veterans' Affairs Entitlements Act to members of our defence forces who are serving with the United Nations forces in Somalia, the former Yugoslavia, and Cambodia. If we are going to continue to contribute to international peacekeeping efforts, it is only fair and just that we recognise the contributions of those who serve in these very dangerous and certainly highly unpredictable circumstances. I believe that it is something all Australians would agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the other amendments the Democrats will be moving tonight. They relate to the issue of pensioner shares. These amendments represent a continuation of the Democrats' efforts to reverse a decision made by the Government last year to treat as income the unrealised capital gain on listed shares for the purpose of income tax for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week both the Democrats and the Opposition introduced Bills designed to achieve this end. We ended up supporting Senator Patterson's Bill. Our amendments today use the Bill that was passed, as it is that wording that this House has already accepted. Therefore we will move our amendments tonight in the hope that they will be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, with any private senator's Bill there is a problem. It can get through the Senate quite easily&mdash;and perhaps not so easily, but at least it can get through&mdash;to go nowhere, to sit on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in the other place and gather dust for months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, perhaps for ever and ever and never actually see the light of day and certainly never get to the point where it is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and is debated. Therefore tonight we will move amendments designed to ensure that the House of Representatives has a further opportunity to review the Bill. The House will actually have to vote on the amendments when the Bill gets back there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Government is going to say all sorts of things about threats to the legislation and the sorts of games that were played last year, but that certainly will not dissuade us from moving these amendments tonight. These amendments give government members in the House of Representatives a chance to look again at this proposal, not just to take the department's word or the Minister's word for what is going on, but actually to look at the measure for themselves. It will also give those people in the community a chance for a week or so at least to put further pressure on the Government, and I am quite happy to say that one of the Democrats' aims is to actually keep pressuring the Labor Government until it does something about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill is demonstrably unfair and inequitable and we, the Democrats, are entitled to use every possible means to see this matter resolved. If the Senate amends the Bill along the lines of our amendments and the House of Representatives rejects it, obviously the Senate will deal with it again. But I hope we would not get to the stage where that happens. We will not be bullied by the Government; we will not be threatened by the Government. We will proceed with our amendments tonight. The Senate has had a chance to look at this Bill. Many members of the House of Representatives have never seen it. There are a number of new members in the House of Representatives and they should have the opportunity to look at this legislation again&mdash;and, for some, to look at it for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any shortage of reasons that the Minister could give for not accepting our amendments, but we will not be moved on this issue. I look forward to some of the Minister's comments. If I look at some of the excuses he gave last time, we should have some interesting discussions in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which was introduced into the other place on 5 May. The Bill was guillotined and passed in a few minutes on 12 May with the usual respect for the democratic process for which the Labor Party is so well known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piece of legislation is not controversial. I do not intend to take too much time tonight speaking about it. The Opposition supports this Bill. Briefly, we are pleased that the Government has consulted with the interest groups&mdash;namely, those in the veteran community&mdash;on the matter of pensions and benefits on this occasion. We contrast that with its behaviour last year in relation to the so-called Bushell legislation amendment of the Veterans' Entitlement Act where there was simply no consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One interesting thing at present in the Department of Veterans' Affairs is audit report No. 8, which deals with aspects of compensation for veterans. I hope the Government honours the undertakings that it has given to consult fully with the veterans organisations in Australia on this matter and has a full consultation with them before it comes to any decision on the implementation of the report. It is a very controversial report because, rightly or wrongly, large numbers of veterans feel that their entitlements will either be reduced or even disappear as a consequence of the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill implements an election promise of the Government to reduce the assets test withdrawal rate from $104 to $78 per annum for each $1,000 above the assets test threshold. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) explained, the level of assets a person who is a home owner will now be able to have before a service pension ceases to be payable will increase by $26,500 for a single pensioner and $22,000 for a pensioner couple. The Government has estimated that about 2,500 veterans and their spouses will become eligible for a service pension as a result of this increase in the level of assets. Those qualifying under this change to the assets test withdrawal rate will receive a pension of about $25 per fortnight. Currently, almost 9,000 service pensioners receive the pension at the reduced rate because of their assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December last year, the Government passed legislation to deal with unrealised capital gains on shares and listed securities. I have moved a private member's Bill to rescind that legislation. In concert with that tonight, I give notice that in the committee stage of the Bill I will be moving the amendments circulated in the name of the Opposition that will amend the provisions of the Act which apply the unrealised capital gains on shares and listed securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the Bill deals with the extension of benefits under the Veterans' Entitlement Act to those members of the ADF who served in Yugoslavia and Somalia who are either back in Australia or who are coming back in the near future. The Australian service personnel in Cambodia have already been covered, but extension is now made to those who served within 50 kilometres of the border of Cambodia in either Laos or Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes and designations mean that the ADF personnel involved will now have an entitlement to things such as service pensions, home loan assistance and a more generous standard of proof being used in determining their entitlements with respect to incapacity or death. The Opposition supports the extension of those entitlements to members of the ADF who served in peacekeeping units. It is fair that that be done on the basis of equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first opportunity I have had to say something about the Australian contingent serving in Somalia. I was fortunate enough to be able to visit Somalia in April per courtesy of the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray. I thank him very much for that generous invitation and for the facilities he made available to me and three other parliamentarians during our visit to the Australian contingent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments I will make relate principally to the 1st Battalion Royal Australian Regiment of the Army and its associated personnel, who made up the great bulk of the Australian contingent in Somalia. But they also cover the movement control officers, who did a marvellous job at Mogadishu basically as RTOs for the UN contingent passing through the airport and the port; the Royal Australian Navy personnel, principally those on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>, who have been in the area of operations for the whole of the deployment; and the RAAF personnel, who maintained the courier service that kept the units there supplied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But most of my comments relate to the battalion. Firstly, the contingent we had posted there was very well trained with very high professional standards. They were very well led by good officers and good NCOs. They were also very well disciplined. One element of that discipline shows in the fact that they drove for many miles&mdash;to the best of my knowledge, in excess of half a million kilometres&mdash;over very bad roads and remained accident free. There was an accident with an APC in Baidoa, where there was mechanical failure of the track, one of the drive shafts or something, but for the road operations it really was a marvellous record. All the troops were dedicated with very high morale. During my time there, I observed them going about their duties with unfailing enthusiasm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somalia itself is a very isolated, tough and harsh country. It reminded me of western Queensland in a bad drought. It is very hot and dusty for most of the time and when the monsoon comes, as it does twice a year in that area, all that dust turns to clay like a black soil plain in central Queensland&mdash;although it is red soil there. The conditions that the Army served under were really very harsh. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sailors and airmen often have sheets on their beds when they are in the field and they have many of the amenities of civilisation when they are on operational postings. Soldiers from time immemorial have lived very close to the earth, and the Australian troops in Somalia were no exception. They had good drinking water from their own resources, they had food and they had transport. But apart from that, they lived as hard as the Somalis themselves did. There were certainly no cool drinks, cool beers or anything like that. Their rations consisted of MREs which we bought from the American forces and ration packs from the Australian Army. There was very little fresh food in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian troops worked seven days a week, and the battalion's companies were out on rotation in various parts of the province for three or four days at a time, rotating back through the headquarters. There was no relaxation of the tension under which they were operating. When they were in camp they were behind barbed wire, and at all times they carried their weapons and magazines. The moment they went outside the camp area everyone wore flak jackets, there was a round in the breach, and they were at full alert for the whole time. Those conditions might not sound harsh, but I can tell the Senate that if one lives that way for a period of months on end without ever relaxing, the cumulative stress is really quite considerable. Given the harshness of the conditions, the troops' morale and enthusiasm which I witnessed 17 weeks into their deployment was quite remarkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the troops when they first went to Somalia was to control the lawlessness in the countryside. It was almost like a movie of the wild west. There does not seem to be much sense of nationalism in Somalia. There seems to be a very strong tribal system. There was tribal warfare, with the warlords, the head of each tribe, using the armoured utilities and other such vehicles mounted with heavy machine-guns or recoilless rifles to run around literally shooting up everything in sight. There was individual banditry to a very high degree. That had to be suppressed and was suppressed by the Australian contingent when it went into Somalia because, until that lawlessness was dispelled, it was quite impossible to have food convoys moving through the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Australian contingent moved into Baidoa in excess of 300 dead bodies a day lay in the streets just as a consequence of the famine and starvation. The first duty of the Australian contingent was to bring law and order into the community, and it did that very well. It did that in the traditional Australian way of very active patrolling. One of the traditions and great strengths of the Australian Army is the fact that it has always been a great patrol master. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going out on patrol in those areas, as it did constantly and relentlessly, is not without its risk. The surprising thing was that a large number of Australian soldiers learnt Somali so that they could converse with the locals. It is the sort of community where people aggregate in great crowds and the nature of the Somali dress is such that it is quite possible to conceal automatic weapons under the cloaks that so many of the men wear. The troops never knew when they came up to a crowd whether they were dealing with people who were armed and intending to take action. The Australian troops coped with that particularly well. They exercised very high levels of discipline and great restraint in apprehending armed personnel, and I think that is reflected in the very few times that they had to actually discharge weapons against any of the lawless members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Associated with this active patrolling right from the outset in all parts of the province was a very active program of involvement in community affairs. The troops talked to the village elders&mdash;they talked to everyone&mdash;and mixed with the Somalis wherever possible and befriended them, and that really paid off. We had a large number of meetings with as many village elders as possible. We met with the marine commander from the American force, of which the Australian contingent was a part, and General Bir, the Turkish UN commander for the whole force, and they were all fulsome in their praise for the Australian troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real test for me was driving around the area. We did a great deal of driving around the area. Everywhere we went the Somalis cheered, clapped or waved at us. Given the dreadful terror that has reigned in that country in recent years, if the Australian troops had not been doing a very good job and if that had not been known and appreciated by the Somalis, they would have looked the other way, thrown rocks or done something like that. But everywhere we went and at all times we met this spontaneous applause from the Somalis. We were always travelling with a fully armed platoon, three trucks and a radio jeep, and every time we stopped a crowd would form and in a short time we would have several hundred friendly people around us. We can be very proud of the achievements of the Australian contingent in Somalia. It fulfilled the expectations of this Parliament when we made a contribution to the United Nations force in Somalia and it fully deserves the provisions of this Bill being applied to its members. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to very briefly answer the comments of Senator Lees on the question of reduced employment prospects, and the rule that prevents people from moving into areas where those prospects are less. Obviously, there has always been the basic obligation on all recipients of those benefits to do their best to get employment. Obviously, if they move to an area where there just is not any employment, or there is less than the area in which they are in and they are significantly reducing their chances, it is reasonable for the Government to move to prevent that. While Senator Lees may have had complaints about the way that this provision may have operated, the truth is that many honourable senators have had the other complaint, coming from the other direction, that too many people have abused the system in the past and just sought to go to areas where there would be no prospect of gaining work. All of us would want to ensure that people genuinely seek work in accordance with the legislation as laid down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees referred to the review which the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, approved in October last year. That review is currently being conducted by DSS in consultation with other departments. It is a wide-ranging review and includes an examination of the appropriateness of this policy in times of an economic downturn. It is expected to be completed in June 1993, and the views of ACOSS and other welfare groups have been sought. I would assume that the problem of the April date has been the intervention of the election, which did interrupt business for all but a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that that explanation satisfies the concerns of Senator Lees. I am sure that in the first week or two when we come back in August we will be able to debate the results of the review. It is a matter of concern, and I know it is something she was complaining about when I was Minister for Social Security all those months ago. I would also like to acknowledge that a number of the measures in the legislation tonight were raised by her on occasions. Senator Lees said that we have taken too long to act. I think there is always a problem in acting quickly to simply take away all of the disincentives that people have. However, when we are responsible for managing the finances of the nation, we cannot take these steps lightly. We also have to balance the public concern on the whole issue of unemployment against the kinds of concerns she has been raising. Nonetheless, the Government is acknowledging tonight in a number of areas that there is room to move. In so far as the other question of reduced unemployment prospects is concerned, we are looking at that as well. At this time it may be appropriate to table a corrigendum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that an Opposition amendment will be moved. I will make a couple of comments on it because it has been circulated, and I hope that the Senate does not take too long with the amendment tonight. The first point is that Senator Patterson and a number of her colleagues have painted themselves as the pensioners' friends here tonight. I wonder where they were when Fightback was being produced and when it pronounced that $1 billion would be taken out of the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the Opposition gained government, we would not be worried about the simple measures contained in this legislation tonight; we would be debating a whole series of cuts&mdash;a slashing of social security expenditure. Those opposite would cut the heart out of unemployment benefits, the pension and pension benefits. The word `heart' has been used often by the Liberals&mdash;but, I might say, only since 13 March. Before then it was a dirty word. I think Chris Puplick referred today to `their painted lips with the venom of a spitting cobra'. I am glad it is being mentioned. It is a good thing to see. But I think it would be a lot more credible if some of those opposite had fought that appalling decision in Fightback&mdash;one only one among many&mdash;to rip $1 billion out of the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, the amendment to the motion that those opposite seek to move is pretty suspect given that sorry record. Point (b) of that amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the abandonment of the promise to remove pensioners from the taxation system by 1995;</PARA>
<PARA>It is pretty rich for those opposite to be telling us tonight that we ought to do things because pensioner groups and ACOSS are saying that we should. The truth is that pensioner groups and ACOSS have been lobbying against the move to remove pensioners from the tax system by 1995 because so many of them take the view that it will be a hindrance to equity. I think that is a legitimate argument to have and one that we ought to have over the course of the coming months. But, again, if the $1 billion cuts had been applied, none of these would have been a problem: everything would have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has made constant reference to the Government's failure to guarantee the extension of full Commonwealth fringe benefits to all long-term retirees beyond the remaining three months of the 1992-93 financial year. While it is cute to draw attention to it by this form of proposed amendment, as Senator Patterson would be aware, the matter is inevitably and properly bound up with discussions between the Commonwealth and the States. Any lack of guarantee of State concessions is due to the fact that the States have again wanted to review responsibility for concessions. That situation was reviewed in 1991-92 as part of the broader review of Commonwealth-State functional responsibilities, but the States want another crack at it only a year later. The difficulty for the Commonwealth, which must work with the States for the provision of fringe benefits&mdash;obviously we must, because a great many of them are dealt with directly by the States&mdash;is that it is impossible to simply ignore that kind of State request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Patterson and, I am sure, most honourable senators are aware, a working party of Commonwealth and State officials is presently looking at the question of the options for ongoing funding of those concessions and who should be responsible for them. That review was undertaken at the request of the States, not the Commonwealth; it is not something that we sought, but it is happening. The Commonwealth holds the view, with some strength and passion, that all pensioners should have access to all Commonwealth and State concessions. All Commonwealth concessions are guaranteed and I sincerely hope that the States will negotiate to achieve an extension of their concessions too. The working party is due to report to the heads of government meeting in early June. I remain hopeful that there will be no problem. The Commonwealth is certainly not holding back; we are trying to urge the States forward but some of them are showing a degree of reluctance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a late-night stunt, and a pretty poor one at that, the Opposition's proposed amendment completely ignores the record of the Opposition, the authors of the amendment, which has been one of an ongoing, unhealthy disdain for the welfare of pensioners and unemployment beneficiaries. The Opposition sought to deal those people out of the system with its Fightback package&mdash;the package which the people of Australia so soundly and sensibly rejected just a few months ago. It shows that some people learn nothing from bitter experience. While that is disappointing, it does keep us all in business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the amendment moved by Senator Reid. The Australian Democrats do not have any great problem with the first two parts of the amendment. We must all acknowledge that the long-term unemployed are growing in number, as are those who are totally disillusioned and giving up the search for work. With respect to paragraph (b), as the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) has already noted, the Australian Democrats have some concerns about the removal of all pensioners from the taxation system, particularly in view of the Government's targeting. If we are to continue along that line, these people should not be in the system at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have no great problem with paragraph (c) but we certainly have problems with (d). We have to acknowledge that our taxation system has problems. We have to acknowledge that, together with the United States, we are the second lowest taxed nation in the Western world. The only country in which workers pay significantly less tax is Turkey. On the smell of an oily rag, we are trying to run a health system, an education system, a social welfare system, and all the rest of it. If, as the Opposition is suggesting here, we make further cuts in expenditure, the people hit will be those who are already hit. In other words, the people who can already afford private education for their children will not be affected, but those who send their kids to state schools will be. People with enough money to afford private health care will not be hurt by cuts to health expenditure, but those people who rely on the public health system will be. The taxation cuts will help those people who, if they need to, can afford private insurance against injury or loss of income. The people who will be hurt by social security cuts are those who cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (e) deals with further tampering with the assets test. The Australian Democrats see problems there. It has been an ongoing problem for pensioners who think they have their affairs settled but who have to face yet further tampering with the assets test. We would like to see greater changes. We do have some problems&mdash;we could debate this all night&mdash;with the fact that, at a time when people are making nothing, the family farm still remains within the assets test. In some cases they are trying to support three generations on the family farm. </PARA>

I am opposed to the current unjust system which taxes the income of families without regard to the number of dependents on that income. That is where the injustice lies. This should be considered in the Social Security Amendment Bill because the Government is taxing families substantially, and then dribbling some of the money back through the social security system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take up much of the time of the Committee because we have already been through the reasons why the coalition is moving this amendment to the Social Security Amendment Bill. In essence, it is the private member's Bill which I moved last week and which was supported by the Australian Democrats. It reviewed the situation which the Government had introduced at the end of last year which meant that unrealised capital gains of pensioners would be treated as income.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be supporting this amendment to the Social Security Amendment Bill as it is identical to the amendment that was circulated earlier today. If I could take issue with one of the matters raised by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) last time we discussed this matter in this place, he noted that there was a difference now of some 20-odd thousand pensioners between those that were officially recognised as having listed shares and those that now have them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I suggest to the Minister that from the information supplied to me by pensioners it is not that pensioners have gone out and purchased shares but rather, because of what the Government has done in relation to additional benefits, that people who have small pension entitlements and happen to have shares have indeed joined the pensioner group, if you like, and become pensioners in order to get those additional entitlements. So it is not simply a matter of additional people purchasing shares but rather the other way around. People who have had share portfolios and maybe were only entitled to a few dollars a week pension have decided that in order to get the fringe benefits it is worth while their becoming part-pensioners. That is the information I have from some pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendment and say that it is now well over 100,000 people who will be affected. While some of them, in effect, may not have their pensions cut, particularly in the short term, the threat of the possibility of losing pension is sufficient for many of them to be certainly rethinking. Some of them have put their decisions on hold for the moment. But we do not want a situation where people are dissuaded in any way from investing in Australian companies; nor do we want a situation where we have pensioners without anything in hand whatsoever losing income. I do not think we need to say any more at the moment. </PARA>

I do not really think we are at cross-purposes, but I guess it is a matter of what happens from here. No doubt it is something we will monitor and debate at another time. So far as I am concerned, it is not germane to the argument. Obviously the Government is opposed to this amendment, and we shall seek to divide on it.

<PARA>Our first amendment is the same as the one that was just passed and which stood in the name of Senator Patterson. This amendment deals directly with the abolition of the reduced employment prospects rule. As I said in an earlier speech, this is one of the major problems with the Social Security Act as it now stands. The Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), who represents the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), says that people are somehow going to reduce their chances of employment by moving. I suggest that he look at the boards at the CES in Adelaide and he will realise that people have virtually a zero chance in many occupations as it is, particularly men in their 40s and 50s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing the unemployed can at least do is go to rural areas in Australia, look for casual employment and take opportunities that arise for cheaper housing. But if they take those options and move their families, they face a 12-week wait for social security benefits. I believe that, as the Minister said, it is a measure which the Government is looking at. But the Government needs to do far more than just look at it. Therefore, tonight we are again bringing this issue to the attention of the Senate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The department routinely distributes Ministerial media releases to a wide range of individuals and organisations in addition to national media organisations. It does so in response to public interest in the substance of a particular release and in support of the Government's policy to encourage a wider public understanding and discussion of foreign and trade policies issues generally. The extent of distribution varies according to the level of interest in a particular release, but a typical release would be sent to as many as 112 individuals and organisations, including, for example, to foreign diplomatic and consular missions in Australia, representatives of the foreign press based outside Canberra, business and academic enquirers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The estimated cost of printing and circulating a typical Ministerial media release in the past 18 months (for example, release No. M32 of 15 February 1993) was $125. The department circulated 474 copies of that release. In the past 18 months the department issued 337 media releases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. Ministerial speeches are circulated both as media releases and in collated form in a quarterly series.
