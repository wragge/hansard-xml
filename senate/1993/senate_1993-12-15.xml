<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Guidelines for Determination of Eligible Child Care Centres (Childcare Assistance), CCA/4B/93/2, made under the Child Care Act 1972, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 18 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines confer discretions on both the Minister and the Secretary or an authorised officer. The Ministerial discretions appear to affect personal and commercial rights to a significant degree. The Explanatory Statement, however, advises that new child care legislation presently being drafted by the Australian Law Reform Commission will provide for AAT review of ministerial decisions. This is an appropriate safeguard. Nevertheless, the Guidelines commence on 1 January 1994 while the new legislation will only be introduced into Parliament later in 1994. The Committee considers that it would be appropriate to amend the Guidelines to provide for AAT review from 1 January 1994 and would appreciate your advice on this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement gives no such assurance about decisions of the Secretary or an authorised officer. The Committee accepts that these discretions appear to be less important than those exercisable by the Minister. Nevertheless, the Committee would welcome your advice on whether AAT review would also be suitable for these decisions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 18 November 1993 concerning the Guidelines for Determination of Eligible Child Care Centres (Childcare Assistance) made under the Child Care Act 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have raised the matter of review of the discretions conferred by the Guidelines on the Minister, the Secretary or an authorised officer. You also sought my advice on the Committee view that the Guidelines should be amended to provide for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of certain decisions from 1 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Guidelines, existing child care centres will be given six months (1 January to 30 June 1994) in which to register under the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System (the System). Accordingly, no decisions that would affect these centres in relation to the System would be made by the Minister until after 1 July 1994. Against this background and because completion of the Australian Law Reform Commission review of child care legislation was scheduled for mid 1994 it was expected that the AAT review provisions for the System would be in place from July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, because of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances' concern about possible delays in finalisation of the ALRC reference I agree to table new Guidelines for Determination of Eligible Child Care Centres (Childcare Assistance), CCA/4B/93/2, to provide for AAT review of decisions by the Minister in relation to the System for existing and new centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am prepared to agree to provide this new instrument, as soon as it can be prepared, with a view to the AAT review arrangements for the System being effective from 1 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that the question of review of decisions currently made by the Minister in relation to all other aspects of the Children's Services Program remain the subject of the ALRC review of the Program. I would of course expect the ALRC to incorporate the proposed AAT review provisions for the System in the new child care legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of a review process for decisions by the Secretary or authorised officers I propose that this issue also remain the subject of the ALRC review of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you require further information or clarification please contact Marianna Serghi in my office on telephone 277 7240.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Due to lack of time, I will not go into the amendment question, but it is difficult to debate something when one does not know the direction the government is taking. The Senate is debating the Native Title Bill 1993&mdash;the government's response to the High Court's Mabo decision. The High Court ruled that native title exists and that Aborigines and Islanders can claim unalienated crown land. The Prime Minister has taken that decision and extended it to include land management, reconciliation, mining leases, pastoral leases, stock routes and tourist leases. He has brought forward the most complex and convoluted piece of legislation. The Pandora's box has been well and truly opened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill will have far-reaching effects on all Australians, both black and white. It will impact on the wealth producers of Australia&mdash;the mining, primary and tourist industries&mdash;and plunge them all into uncertain financial futures. There is no certainty for any of these industries. The legislation will be interpreted in the courts throughout Australia in a series of cases that will be time consuming and force delays in getting projects under way for all of those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The graziers and the farmers will have to defend expensive native title claims against government-funded organisations. No estimate has been made of the loss to the mining industry as it battles its way through a legal maze of uncertainty of government-funded tribunals and courts, or the impact it will have as it takes its expertise and capital offshore, where governments actually encourage wealth-creating industries that give jobs and prosperity to their citizens instead of putting up barriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has thrown around a ballpark figure of $200 million, based on no facts at all. Australians are being asked to sign a blank cheque under this legislation. The legislation is uncosted in every respect. The bill, which the Prime Minister has embraced as his own, is another example of how far out of touch he is with the electorate and how willing he is to put the wellbeing of Australia at risk to fulfil his personal ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said in his second reading speech that it would be a failure on our part if we did not recognise the past and that we must acknowledge the past treatment of Aborigines. No-one can condone the treatment Aborigines received in the past; but that does not mean that this generation can exorcise the sins of the past. To compensate for the past only discriminates against future generations of Australians, both black and white. It will discriminate against school leavers and unionists as scarce jobs become scarcer, as the mining industry winds down exploration. With 160,000 people directly employed and 470,000 indirectly employed, the jobs the mining industry creates will fall away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will discriminate against every Australian as our living standards drop, as our primary products and mining exports fall from $37 billion. Our trade deficit will rise, our dollar fall and our international debt soar. It will discriminate against farmers, pastoralists, small towns and regional Australia as primary producers fight native title claims and wealth-creating station properties supplying jobs to workers in abattoirs and transport operators are taken out of production, as happened in the Northern Territory. It will discriminate against Aboriginals and Islanders living on communities where native title is vested in another group of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received advice from Senator Collins which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear likely that in general grants made under laws for the special benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will not have extinguished native title. It is therefore possible that native title will continue to exist on at least some D.O.G.I.T land.</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that would be the same in every other state. This bill asks more questions than it answers. While Senator Collins's advice makes it clear that indigenous people who live on Aboriginal communities will have their present rights protected, it is not clear what their position would be if they wanted to grow vegetables, open a caravan park, cut timber or take on some other project in those communities. Will they be fully fledged members of the community or merely tenants tolerated by the community? No doubt that will be determined by court action, when we will see one group of Aboriginals take another group to court to establish their rights: Aborigines against Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is a disaster. If ever a piece of legislation was designed to kill the goose that laid the golden egg, this is it. This legislation will give Aboriginal people a right to claim native title if they can establish their ties with the land. We have been told by the Aboriginal negotiating team that this legislation will pick up 12,000 Aborigines. There are between 250,000 and 300,000 Aborigines in Australia. This legislation will meet the needs of between five and seven per cent of indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister tells us that a land fund will be established to enable indigenous people to acquire land and manage and maintain it in a sustainable way in order to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations. This will provide for the remaining Aboriginal community which will not have access to land under this legislation&mdash;those Aborigines who live in regional towns and cities and capital cities and communities throughout Australia. The land fund established under this bill will be set up by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation does not tell us how much money will be required to be paid into the fund, although Michael Mansell believes that $200 million will barely scratch the surface. We do not know the circumstances in which payments will be made or who will operate the fund. How much will eventually be required in the fund is not spelled out. How can any reasonable or responsible member of parliament vote for a landcare fund without any knowledge of what it will cost, who will run it or how it will work? We are asked to do that by voting for this legislation, and we are told that the details will be fixed up later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already, Aboriginal people have large land holdings in every state. In Queensland, under deed of grant in trust, all former state government Aboriginal communities were handed over to the indigenous people on those communities to administer themselves under the Local Government Act. Three million hectares of prime land, much of it beachfront, went to the 30,000 Aborigines who resided in those communities. Each community elected its own council under local government and ran its own operation. The land was vested in elected local councils as trustees and any community dweller that had access to a block of land to engage in farming or grazing or any other business project. Many indigenous people took advantage of this Queensland legislation to start their own small business, but this legislation we are asked to vote on today will kill that. In the Northern Territory, 500,000 square kilometres has gone to Aboriginal communities and 190,000 square kilometres in South Australia. There is a huge amount of land that has been passed over to our indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to address some important issues on pastoral leases and how they are affected by this legislation. This bill has raised all sorts of uncertainties in relation to pastoral leases by its discriminatory way of validating only leases granted after 1975 and leaving all previous leases governed solely by the High Court's Mabo decision. This Native Title Bill validates all pastoral leases that have been invalidly granted; that is, all leases granted after 1975, of which there are only around 11. However, the real uncertainty arises in relation to all other pastoral leases&mdash;those granted between 1788 and 1975. This legislation does not validate them. This bill adopts the common law in relation to native title as the law of Australia. All pastoral leases bar the 11 granted after 1975 are therefore open to claim under the High Court ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans told the Senate, in answer to questions on this issue, that he did not believe there would be many claims that could succeed. He admitted that they could arise as fiduciary duty claims or other common law claims, such as happened with the Wik claim over the Comalco bauxite mine in Queensland. According to advice from our top legal firms, it seems that under this legislation, if a pastoral lease is not automatically renewable or if the lease contains reservations or conditions for native use, native title probably coexists and revives at the completion of the pastoral lease. Pastoral leases in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia all contain reservations for present statutory right of access for Aboriginals. The consequence could be that native title will revive on the expiry of the lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do the government and the Australian people understand the areas of land that are caught by this possibility? Over 50 per cent of my home state of Queensland is covered by pastoral lease; that is, 937,000 square kilometres covered by 37,910 pastoral and freehold leases. In Queensland it is unclear whether pastoral leases are automatically renewable. In Queensland a pastoral lease is surrendered and there is a ministerial decision before the lease is reissued. In the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia, pastoral leases contain statutory provisions beneficial to Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, as the government has decided to validate only the post-1975 leases, there is a very real problem with pastoral leases granted prior to 1975 that have statutory reservations for Aboriginals in that native title probably coexists with them. The issue then arises: can these pastoral leases be renewed? According to advice, it seems possible that pastoral leases which coexist with native title and which do not have a legally enforceable right to renew will, as current leases expire, automatically become exclusively native title land, with no capacity for either the current lessees or the state or territory governments which granted the leases to prevent this happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a major flaw in this legislation in that it cannot be applied nationally because of different land law systems in different states. The consequence for some states will be the possibility of removing major proportions of their land from free use. Marshall Perron, Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, has stated that 90 per cent of the Northern Territory is likely to fall under Aboriginal title of one kind or another, either inalienable freehold title under the Northern Territory land rights legislation or native title under this bill. Nearly half of the Northern Territory is under Aboriginal ownership already. Nearly 80 per cent of Western Australia is either crown land or pastoral lease, and in Western Australia pastoral leases are considered to be crown land. The Land Act in Western Australia provides for Aboriginals to enter any unenclosed or unimproved parts of the land subject to a pastoral lease to seek their sustenance in their accustomed way. As I have already said, these statutory rights may revive native title over these areas of land where access is allowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, by throwing up legal intricacies that can be solved only by recourse to the courts, does no-one a service. It is similar in South Australia, where pastoral leases form 43.8 per cent of the state and cover 43,079,340 hectares. South Australian legislation also allows for Aboriginals to enter and use pastoral land in any traditional way. Native title may be extinguished to the extent that it is inconsistent with this provision. But South Australian pastoral leases remain under threat to the extent that leasehold land is used for traditional use. This is very different from the Prime Minister's placating words on 16 November, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is probably only where there is so-called vacant crown land and in remote areas where traditional Aboriginal life has not been disrupted that native title exists.</PARA>
<PARA>We cannot introduce all this uncertainty into the grazing and mining industries and expect things to go along as they have in the past, with these two industries continuing to reliably provide the bulk of our export income. In the pastoral industry, properties are not being bought and sold because of the uncertainty created by this legislation. No doubt bankers are reluctant to lend on title they do not yet have certainty over. </PARA>

Mining companies are not obligated to invest in Australia. Mining is an international industry which can exist only if it has security of title. The attractiveness and development of mining in Australia were based on our stability. Compared with most other countries, we had important advantages when it came to investment. We may have had problems with high labour costs or excessive government red tape, but we always had the fundamental right of secure access to land and security of tenure. This political stability has always provided us with our own special area of comparative advantage. </PARA>

At stake is our future. Already the Australian Mining Industry Council has warned that mineral exploration and investment spending are not enough to sustain current production levels, that few projects are under construction and that production growth has fallen over the past two years. Australia is not such a rare source of mineral and agricultural wealth that investment will not be lost overseas and exports replaced by others. Just this week, CRA announced that it would cut its 1994 Australian exploration budget by nearly 40 per cent. </PARA>

All our resource industries&mdash;mining, agriculture, forestry, fishing and tourism&mdash;need certainty of title. All will be affected in some way by this legislation. We cannot assume that the mining and agricultural industries will continue to underwrite our wealth and continue to employ 160,000 people Australia wide in mining or 390,000 directly in agriculture. </PARA>

No-one knows what grazing land will be lost from pastoral leases being able to be bought and converted to native title, and there will certainly be plenty of taxpayers' funds around to buy up these pastoral leases. Stock routes, being crown land, will be claimable under native title. There will be disruption from land adjoining river beds being able to form part of native title claims. </PARA>

It is also uncertain whether pastoral leases which have been converted to mining leases may be prevented from reverting to pastoral leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any future grants of pastoral leases will involve lengthy negotiations under this bill. If there has been no previous claim, it has to proceed on the basis that there may be a native title claim and everyone on the list has to be notified. Even if a future act is unopposed, native title is extinguished and claims for compensation may be made at any time after the extinguishment. Also, the rural pastoral leaseholders will not receive the same ready assistance with legal costs as the native title claimants. Legal assistance will be granted only at the discretion of the Attorney-General and only if the hardship test is met, which as yet has not been spelled out. </PARA>

To leave all pre-1975 pastoral leases open to challenge is to introduce uncertainties to the grazing industry which the NFF should have fought against. </PARA>

This bill does not make one iota of difference to the health, education and housing standards of Aborigines in Australia. We are already spending a lot of money&mdash;some $1.3 billion&mdash;and we are nowhere near making enough use of that to alleviate the Aborigines' position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of Mabo against Queensland was to claim native title on the island of Mer in the Murray Islands. I believe that that was as far as the High Court went. Not one iota of evidence was ever taken after that to try to prove that native title existed in the rest of Australia. The Murray Islanders were not nomadic. They cultivated crops, built permanent housing, had no community titles and were Melanesians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray Islands were not part of Australia in 1788 and were claimed by Queensland in the late 1870s. So we cannot really say that the Murray Islands were part of what the British Empire claimed in 1788 when the British came here. If the British had not come here in 1788, Australia might have been colonised by someone that might have been tougher on the indigenous people of Australia. The High Court decision that terra nullius did not exist in the Murray Islands was understandable, but that is as far as I believe it should have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mainland is totally different. It was inhabited by nomadic tribes with no housing and no individual persons having particular title. Yet, without any skerrick of further evidence, this government, headed by Mr Keating, allowed the judgment to spread to all of Australia. If further evidence had been taken and the High Court had found differently, then I would have been happy to accept that; but it did not. I doubt that Aboriginals, with the small number there were in the total area of Australia, could have possibly come near to covering all areas of Australia. I fly over a lot of outback Western Australia and into the Great Victoria Desert, the Gibson Desert and other places; and I believe that there is a lot of land that black man, let alone white man, has never set foot on.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MYTHS ON BLACKS PERSIST</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the mid-1950s, Bill Grayden, then a member of the Western Australian Parliament, and a few others visited the Western Desert in a couple of four-wheel-drive vehicles and discovered the Pintubi people, reputedly the indigenous inhabitants of that area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to contemporary reports, they had not previously seen white men and were in a wretched condition, partly due to an extended drought. The reports provoked a lot of hand-wringing, charges and confessions of white guilt of having, by neglecting these people, allowed them to sink into such a squalid existence. Shortly afterwards they were taken off the land. Fashions change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1940s, a 10-year-old boy later known as Jimmy Bienderry walked in with his clan from the Western Desert to a white settlement in the Kimberleys. It was another severe drought period. Bienderry's clan had not seen white men either but had apparently heard about them from other Aborigines living closer to white settlements. They were told, correctly, that a food supply was assured in white settlements. There are numerous other reports of similar incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point of these stories is that not all Aborigines were driven off their land by white men with guns. Some, possibly quite a lot, left voluntarily to escape from their precarious struggle for survival. Tasmanian Aborigines at the time of white settlement did not know how to make fire or catch fish&mdash;technology they are believed to have once had but lost. They wore animal skins but did not make clothing appropriate for a cold climate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, of course, many parts of Australia more hospitable to people with only Stone Age technology at best than the Western Desert and Tasmania, but there is no good reason to believe Aborigines enjoyed the idyllic life that ignorant white romanticists insist they did. It has often been claimed that Aboriginal quality of life at the time of white settlement was at least as good as the masses had in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That may well have been true in the more favoured areas, but what was the quality of life in the late 18th-century Europe? Cholera, typhoid, smallpox, chronic malnutrition and sporadic starvation. How many people, white or Aboriginal, would be happy to settle for 18th-century living standards?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To sanctimonious whites dedicated to belittling or vilifying the achievements of Western technology, while simultaneously gorging on them, pointing out facts like this is racist. A few weeks ago they asserted we should learn from Aborigines how to live in harmony with nature, as some near-traditional Aborigines allegedly still do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that if 20th-century life-support systems&mdash;Toyotas, running water, electricity, aircraft, imported food, drink and clothing&mdash;were withdrawn from the Western Desert and similar areas, the Aborigines would not want to stay there any more than the Pintubi did nearly 40 years before, let alone the whites who fawn on "traditional" lifestyles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Running in parallel with this misguided nature worship is a belief that the social and economic problems of most contemporary Aborigines are attributable to "dispossession", and that land rights will fix them up. Leaving aside the fact that not all were "dispossessed", the available statistics do not support that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1991 census data show that Aborigines in Victoria and Tasmania, the most thoroughly "dispossessed", have much higher incomes, significantly longer life expectancy and a better education than Northern Territory Aborigines&mdash;the least "dispossessed" and major recipients of land rights. In Western Australia an analysis of ABS census data showed a very strong inverse correlation between income and the propensity to speak an Aboriginal language at home. (Brunton, October `93.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of this is terribly surprising. The relatively affluent and healthy Aborigines are those with the highest level of socio-economic "assimilation". It is politically incorrect to say that, but what are our objectives: the material wellbeing of Aborigines&mdash;or feeling good about ourselves?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almost certainly there is a higher proportion of part-Aborigines in the more affluent groups&mdash;a function of the duration of their association with white Australia, not biological inheritance. Apparently in the politically correct (brave?) new world, we are not allowed to say part-Aboriginal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, any level of biological Aboriginality makes a person Aboriginal. This seems to me a bit racist, which might explain why Hitler had a similar idea about Jews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presumably Ghengis Khan and his mob were into rape as well as pillage and murder, so, six or seven hundred years later, most of the population of Eastern Europe probably has a Mongol ancestor. Does that make them Mongol? Twenty generations from now, a majority of Australians will probably have an Aboriginal ancestor.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This article sets out the myths that persist about Aborigines. If in the native title or Mabo case it had have been proven that native title existed all around Australia, the government could have legislated around the situation. The government is very quick to act when it is a tax matter. If the High Court decides on any tax scheme in favour of the taxpayer, the government runs down to the High Court the next day to get the decision reversed. It could have done that in this case. If there had been proof that natives or anyone else was dispossessed of anything, then there should have been compensation, and I would have had no argument about that.</PARA></TALK.START>

Western Australia is vastly different in this situation. The government can argue as much as it likes, the Greens&mdash;who are supposed to represent WA&mdash;can argue as much as they like, and the Democrats can say what they like because I do not take any notice, but Western Australia is altogether different. It is well known that 40 per cent of WA is up for grabs. That 40 per cent includes some of the pastoral areas, all the mining areas and all vacant crown land, which includes all unexplored areas. This legislation says that mining leases do not extinguish native title, but native title can be put into place at the end of the lease. The lease can expire halfway through a mining venture. </PARA>

The closure of a mine on the termination of a lease does not mean the end of the resources. I am old enough to have seen the Yilgarn goldfield of Western Australia rise and fall four times. In my father's time, it would have done that another three times. There is a boom, a bust, a boom and a bust. If during one of those busts the land reverted to native title, then I believe those resources would be shut up forever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we add to the 40 per cent of pastoral leases that are claimable those pastoral leases that Senator Boswell has said are suspect, it comes to around 78 per cent. I am not fully convinced that pastoral leases are safe. Mr Simon Crean, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, was not able to give a full undertaking to the House of Representatives during the debate there. Pastoral leases are not safe while this bill allows them to be converted to native title after purchase by ATSIC. ATSIC is buying a lot of the pastoral areas in the Kimberleys in Western Australia; it is paying for them, and it is quite entitled to do it. I add that it is getting those stations very cheaply because of the unfortunate economic situation of the cattle industry in that area, a lot of it caused by drought. This bill will allow pastoral areas to be changed to native title, which will head the pastoral industry towards extinguishment. I suppose that this fits in with the secret agenda of the Kimberley Land Council in Western Australia. There are other agendas there, such as the burn-out policy, and some station owners have to sell out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stakes in Western Australia are very high. Western Australia provides 25 per cent of Australia's exports. It is easy for other states to take a relaxed approach to this, as Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland have. Hopefully, with a Liberal government now, South Australia will be a little different. I believe that not a square metre of Victoria could be claimed under native title, but I note that Mr Kennett has seen the light and is supporting the Western Australian position. The Northern Territory is already beyond this legislation because of the Land Rights Act. </PARA>

The value of Western Australian mineral production was $12 billion in 1991-92 and the industry paid $344.881 million to government in that year. The mineral trade gave Western Australia a $10.49 billion trade surplus in 1991-92, underpinning a 2.4 per cent gross product against national growth of 0.4 per cent. The mining industry has the highest productivity of any Australian industry, with output per employee being five times that of manufacturing. Over 40 per cent of national mineral exports are produced in Western Australia. In the last decade, private mineral exploration has risen to almost 60 per cent of the total spent in all states.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That means, is it in the interest of all Australians, indigenous and non-indigenous?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be voting against such legislation for one basic reason: it is bad legislation for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it is not legislation for Australia; it is legislation to address a wrongdoing of the past. Even though we can only ever partly achieve such an objective because we have to recognise that this country has changed over the last 200-odd years, the bill seeks to address a very specific issue. Dr Hewson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest myths created by the government about this legislation is that it is presented as some kind of panacea for Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage. The fact is that it is nothing of the kind. Anyone who has seen at first hand the living conditions and the lack of opportunity in so many Aboriginal and Islander communities will know that a nation such as Australia should never tolerate such a situation. Standards of health, education, life expectancy, infant disease and infection, and many more issues affecting Aboriginals and Islanders, remain totally unacceptable when compared to the standards and conditions enjoyed by other Australians. None of these problems will be addressed by this legislation. This legislation will do nothing about Aboriginal and Islander health. It will do nothing about their education. It will do nothing about their welfare and living conditions. The bill is no shortcut to overturning a legacy of disadvantage and neglect.</PARA>
<PARA>He is dead right, because it does not seek to do that. It never did. With respect to normal day-to-day issues, why should we talk about Aboriginal or indigenous people as though they were different from us? We should not. </PARA>

This country has a health policy, an education policy and other policies that address day-to-day issues, and they should apply equally to all Australians, be they indigenous or otherwise, and they do.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, governments can acquire private property but only if they pay compensation and only if they do not discriminate against any citizen or group of citizens.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look at this way: some people say that Mabo is a distraction from Australia's real problems of economic mismanagement and particularly high unemployment.

<PARA>Of course, Senator Bishop, who took a very divisive approach to this issue, said that we should have a referendum on it. Of course, we all know what the results of that would be, given the type of campaign that would be conducted in respect of native title. Mr Reith went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, we have to respect each other's rights.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue then is to define those rights. No-one questions the legitimacy of the High Court per se. I have made it quite clear that, personally, I do not think the High Court should have overturned the acknowledged law&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand, Mr Reith says that he supports rights, and then turns around and says that he does not think the High Court should have overturned acknowledged law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the bill is now to be debated in the Senate. Early this morning, I think it was, Senator Hill raised the issue of amendments. I have not been here very long but when we were debating the industrial relations legislation Senator Hill raised the question of amendments as well as the question of time&mdash;the time needed to debate this bill, the time needed to consider it to the fullest extent to enable an appropriate result to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us on this side of the chamber who sat through the hours and hours of diatribe about the industrial relations legislation have to wonder just how genuine the opposition is in respect of any issue. During the course of the industrial relations debate we went on for hours with a whole load of rhetoric about nothing. None of the opposition's amendments were of any real substance, other than to defeat the industrial relations bill. We heard rhetoric about how the legislation would ruin the economy of the country and create further unemployment, et cetera. All those claims, all that rhetoric is being contradicted by reports in the press, and we can read them daily. </PARA>

We are yet to see the amendments that the government may seek to move in the committee stage, but there are very good grounds why we on this side of the chamber cannot support the bill that has been brought before us. Those grounds start with the basic assumption of the equality of all Australians. Senator Murphy has just spent 20 minutes exercising the collective guilt of Australia over the last 200 years, as though those on the other side of the chamber are the sole repository of morality and conscience in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is a useful start for the consideration of this matter to look at the track record of those on the other side of this chamber in terms of matters of racial discrimination and treatment of Aborigines and see where the guilt may lie. The guilt for many of the wrongdoings in Australia's past, not just against Aborigines but also against other Australians, lies with the Labor Party and the achievements of the Labor Party. I say that as somebody who is half Chinese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Labor Party that formulated, refined and perfected the most racist immigration policy the world has ever seen&mdash;it was called the white Australia policy. It was the Labor Party that consistently maintained that white Australia policy irrespective of the detriment to the people affected. When Singapore was under imminent threat of Japanese occupation, Arthur Calwell, then minister for immigration&mdash;one of the great leading lights of the Labor Party&mdash;dillied and dallied for weeks, not wanting to allow people of mixed race, Chinese and Malays, to flee Singapore. This was notwithstanding the fact that to prevent those people leaving meant that they would at best be interned in places like Changi and at worst be taken out and summarily executed. It is an interesting point that one of the people who was taken out for summary execution, who was machine-gunned on a beach in Singapore and survived, was in fact Lee Kwan Yew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was Arthur Calwell who, after the war when there were only 8,000 people in this country of Chinese extraction, rammed through parliament the wartime refugee repatriation bill, which sought to expel 800 Asiatics, as he referred to them, on the basis that to allow just 800 to stay would undermine the whole basis of Australia's established immigration policy. That is the bona fides of those on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The post-war election was fought in part on the racist immigration policy of the Labor Party, on its racist white Australia policy, and that is why it was thrown out after the war and why it did not return until 1972. I was born in 1965; I was born in the days of the white Australia policy. I grew up with the racism of the Labor Party. I grew up with `Two wongs don't make a white'. I know all about it. But that is the past. If we bring up the next generations of Australians with the guilt, the burden and the chip on the shoulder that previous generations ought to bear, then we do not progress this country one iota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we bring up future generations of Australians to believe that they have a never-ending guilt for what may or may not have happened 200 years ago, then we do not bring them up to be fit citizens for the 20th or 21st century; we bring them up in the 18th and 19th centuries. That is what we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make one other point clear. Many things were done over the last 200 years to Aboriginal people and others and not all of them have been bad. Even the things that those on the other side complain of as wrong were in many cases done with the best intentions. I do not think one can say that the missionaries who went out to areas like the Cape York Peninsula, outback Queensland and outback New South Wales did it with bad intentions. They did it with what were then good intentions, but we look with hindsight and we look with different eyes. That is why we on this side of the chamber reject the notion that there should be a never-ending guilt to burden generation upon generation of Australians, because that should not be the way in which this country develops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much for the overview of the Labor Party's right to talk about who is right and who is wrong in this debate. So much for its right to lecture us on morality. We know all about morality. We know that it was the Labor Party, for example, in Queensland that put in the most pernicious and discriminatory laws against Aborigines, which were repealed after 1957 when the coalition took government. We know all those things. That is the limit of the Labor Party's right to talk about conscience and morality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now here to talk about the Native Title Bill. Looking at this bill, one could, in good conscience, do nothing but oppose this bill. Senator Murphy, for example, challenged us on this side of the chamber saying, `Do you as the coalition support the Mabo High Court decision?'. We have said that we recognise and accept the High Court decision. He said, `If you do, why do you not support this bill?'. We do not support this bill because this bill is not the Mabo High Court decision. This bill is the Mabo High Court decision plus the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at Redfern, plus plus plus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to extend the bounds of the Mabo High Court decision. It seeks to create opportunities to extend that decision and to extend the challenges that decision poses to all Australians. But in particular this bill seeks to facilitate a wholesale grab by the Commonwealth of the land management functions which are constitutionally and correctly the province of the states and the territories. That is why we cannot support this bill. This bill is about a grab for power by Canberra and yet this bill does very little to improve the rights of Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been the subject of great misrepresentation, but the great misrepresentations about this bill have not come from our side of the chamber; they have not come from the National Party or the Liberal Party. They have come from the other side of the chamber. They have come from individuals in the other  place,  most  notably  the  Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister and the government have said to the primary industries of Australia, `You are protected under this bill'. They have said to them, `Your properties, your farms, your stations are protected under this bill'. Yet when one delves into this bill one finds that is anything but the case. Let people understand one thing about what is protected by this bill. The only grants of land which are protected by this bill are grants of land which are invalid because of the existence of native title. In 3 1/2 days of hearings, I did not hear one clear explanation of what that meant. The best we can seem to gather is that the principal cause of invalidity for issues of grants of land will be the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the clearest argument is that the only grants of land which are protected by this bill are grants of land which were issued in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act, and therefore cannot include any grants of land issued before 1975. As most of the pastoral properties, most of the farms and most of the stations in this country are based on leases that were issued before 1975, they do not attract the protection of any of the provisions of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to renewal which is claimed to be protected for post-1975 invalid leases is not protected in this bill because the wording of the two relevant clauses is different. So we have one regime for pre-1975 grants of land and one regime for post-1975 grants of land. But the only things that are protected are the invalid, not the valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the other side of the chamber could argue that the Mabo High Court decision said, by three judges to two, that native title appears to be extinguished by a valid grant of leasehold. But this bill does not do anything to confirm the fact that those valid grants of leasehold interest or other interests should be allowed to continue. This bill does nothing about those. In fact, what it does, by dint of bad drafting, is jeopardise the right of renewal for those previously issued pastoral leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me start with Western Australia. Leaving aside the Court legislation, looking just at this bill and assuming that Western Australia adopted exactly the same regime as this one, by virtue of section 202 of the Western Australian land act, the holder of a pastoral lease is obliged to make continual improvements to the pastoral property. Those improvements, to the extent that they constitute fencing the property and certain other actions, would affect the rights of native titleholders. Irrespective of the right to renew, there would be a problem, because the right to renew is subject to the interests of native titleholders. For the purposes of considering a renewal, the rights of native titleholders are deemed not to be the right to collect firewood, not to be the right to hunt and gather, and not to be the right to fish; they are deemed to be the rights of freeholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an elementary matter of law that the crown cannot grant a leasehold interest in favour of one person over the top of what is a freehold interest on the part of another person. So, by virtue of this bill, because the renewal of validly issued pastoral leases after 1 January 1994 becomes a future act under this bill, and the operation of section 202 of the Western Australian land act, we have the absurd situation that, even if the West Australian government wanted to adhere to this legislation, it would appear that many pastoral leases will not be able to be renewed by operation of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other states, too, we have problems with the renewal of pastoral leases. Those problems revolve around the fact that, for example, in Queensland there is no such thing as a legally enforceable right to renew. One merely has a right to apply for the renewal of a lease. As the minority report of the legal and constitutional affairs committee showed, in Queensland there is a working procedural instruction that advises that when a lease, even if it is a grazing homestead perpetual lease, comes up for surrender, a new lease is to be issued in its place and the previous lease is deemed to have been expired&mdash;extinguished&mdash;for the purposes of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that the application to renew a pastoral lease or a forestry lease becomes, in effect, a future act. The granting of that lease becomes a future act. Nothing in this bill gives any protection at all to the lessee. Nothing in this bill gives any protection at all to the farmer. Nothing in this bill gives any protection at all to the pastoralist or to the grazier. This bill pitches them into an uncertain void because they are open to challenge by punitive native title claimants who say, `We have native title over this land and it has coexisted with the valid pastoral lease'. It will matter not one jot before the law that that farmer says, `But the High Court argued three to two this way on a matter of obiter dictum'. As long as the native title claimants assert that they have a right to native title, it pitches the person whose lease is being renewed into a legal struggle to get that lease renewed. A very thoughtful opinion dated 13 December 1993 prepared by Messrs Blake Dawson Waldron for the Australian Mining Industry Council said that if there is a future decision about coexistence of native title, we have a very difficult situation indeed. The opinion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Renewal of existing interests, where there is no legally enforceable right to renew. Only after a determination of invalidity will the renewal be able to take place&mdash;if valid, the Bill may impede or prevent renewal altogether.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what this bill has done. Yet the Prime Minister told the primary industries of this country that our farms, our pastoral properties and our stations were safe. That is nothing, at best, but the grossest misrepresentation and it is doing nothing but selling the primary industries of this country an uncertain future by telling them that their future was safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill creates a difficult regime for our fishing industry because it says that native title claimants can make a claim in respect of land or waters. Waters, in so far as they are onshore waters, would appear to include everything within the state jurisdiction and that is, three miles out from the low watermark. That may seem to be a trifling matter; it is a serious matter if that is how onshore waters are defined for the purposes of this bill. </PARA>

All the papers that have been prepared in relation to native title claims over territorial waters&mdash;for example, the paper prepared by the Attorney-General's Department, `The Constitutional Law Reform Session No. 1, Mabo: Implications for the Commonwealth'&mdash;refer to the operation of international law and matters of state jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>

That said that for the purposes of drawing baselines&mdash;and baselines are very important for this whole matter&mdash;we had to look to what were called drying rocks, that is, rocks or reefs that were exposed at the low watermark. As Senator Boswell well knows, and as other honourable senators from Queensland well know, large chunks of the Great Barrier Reef are exposed at the low watermark. If we draw a three-mile line from one drying rock to the next drying rock along the Great Barrier Reef, we will have an almost contiguous stretch of water which will be subject to native title claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of that is that, in so far as native title applies to waters, it applies to the bed under the water. That would restrict the operation of the tourism industry; it could quite clearly restrict the operation of the fishing industry. So this bill does nothing to provide certainty for the fishing or tourism industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does nothing to provide certainty for the forestry industry, because the forestry leases upon which the industry relies may well be&mdash;by the admission of the government's advisers at the hearing on Monday last week&mdash;category D past acts, which do not extinguish native title.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court's Mabo decision has occupied much of this parliament's time in the last six months. In one respect it has raised the level of political literacy&mdash;although some of the contributions opposite are not showing that&mdash;in Australia in a way that no public education program could have achieved. Millions of Australians who perhaps had never heard of the High Court, or perhaps only remembered visiting the building near the lake, now know how important its role is in our constitutional and legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be other High Court decisions which will affect Australians more and pose problems for government. For example, the recent decision on the validity of state franchise taxes might have been one, although the High Court showed a keen sense of pragmatism in avoiding conflict by having two bob each way. However, no decision since the Communist Party Dissolution Act judgment 40 years ago has attracted more public and media comment, informed or otherwise, than the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various commentators have suggested that the High Court's decision was some sort of departure from normal judicial reasoning or standards. It is said that the High Court engaged in law making, judicial activism or social engineering. All this is to be condemned, so the critics say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that every court makes law from time to time. It is often the failure of legislatures to address important issues that makes citizens turn to the courts for redress. Sometimes those legislative failures are due to the inability of elected governments to get their legislation through malapportioned or gerrymandered state upper houses like those of Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it is an irony that the colleagues of those opposite in the Western Australian Legislative Council blocked Labor's original land rights legislation which had the support of the mining and pastoral interests of WA in the mid-1980s. That legislation, if passed, would have satisfied Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and given Western Australian legislation which might have served as a model for other states. The political blindness which afflicted the WA branch of the Liberal Party on Aboriginal matters at that time unfortunately continues today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the High Court was confronted with the Mabo claim it was given the opportunity to clarify legal uncertainty. Up until Mabo, the generally accepted conventional wisdom was that Australian law did not recognise the concept of native title. In the early 1970s Aborigines in the Northern Territory had raised similar issues before its Supreme Court in the Nabalco case. Mr Justice Blackburn stated quite clearly that the doctrine of common law native title had no place in a settled colony unless recognised by an act of parliament. The Nabalco case was a disappointment for Aboriginal people all over Australia. However, in a few years, thanks to the commitment of the Whitlam and, I have to say, the Fraser governments, a fair and equitable land rights regime had been established in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislative success in the territory, followed later by the recognition of Aboriginal land claims in some other states, reduced the focus on the question of native title for many Aboriginal people. However, some lawyers were doing their homework. They were looking at how other jurisdictions such as Canada, New Zealand and the United States had addressed the issue of native title. The Privy Council, as the ultimate appeal court for many former British colonies, had also dealt with the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This research revealed that native title was a recognised principle in all common law jurisdictions and had been for some time. In 1823 Chief Justice Marshall of the United States Supreme Court said the `original habitants' should be recognised as having `a legal as well as a just claim to retain the occupancy of their traditional lands.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The English common law, as stated in numerous Privy Council cases this and last century, also recognised this principle. Indeed, in 1973 Sir Garfield Barwick, Chief Justice of the High Court, said that the `traditional result' of British occupation or settlement was that `the indigenous people were secure in their usufructuary title to land' and that `the ultimate title subject to usufructuary title was vested in the Crown.' The court was dealing with a Papua New Guinea case but it had clearly recognised that, at least in PNG, native title existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this depth of precedent from respected courts of the English-speaking world, it was unlikely our own High Court would fail to acknowledge this line of authority if and when the question was put to it. Despite some Australian cases which had failed to acknowledge the existence of native title at common law, there was enough authority to the contrary to place those judgments in doubt. The High Court did not lightly discard those previous authorities. As Chief Justice Brennan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In discharging its duty to declare the common law of Australia, this Court is not free to adopt rules that accord with contemporary notions of justice and human rights if their adoption would fracture the skeleton of principle which gives the body of our law its shape and internal consistency . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the need to adhere to local precedent, the chief justice, when referring to previous decisions denying native title, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no case can command unquestioning adherence if the rule it expresses seriously offends the values of justice and human rights (especially equality before the law) which are aspirations of the contemporary Australian legal system.</PARA>
<PARA>The skeleton of principle of our Australian common law has not been fractured by the Mabo decision. Indeed, the recognition of native title rights by our High Court has released a few skeletons out of our national closet and confronted us with some hard choices and decisions. A few spectres have also been conjured up by some of the people opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those decisions is how to address the impact of Mabo on other land users. The reality is that Mabo will have little impact on most Australians&mdash;Aboriginal or non-Aboriginal. Most Aboriginal people have ceased to enjoy any traditional relationship with their former land. Most non-Aboriginal Australians occupy land over which any native title interests were extinguished long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: how do we devise a system where rights of use and occupation of remaining land can be enjoyed for the benefit of all Australians? That is a question which this bill addresses. In contrast, the government in Western Australia has, from the outset, attempted to deny the validity of the High Court's decision and its recent legislation, rushed through parliament in a blur of all night sittings, purports to extinguish native title entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has replaced those rights with inferior rights of traditional usage, the enjoyment of which depends on ministerial whim and discretion. In contrast to the bill before us, it gives government ministers virtually total power to extinguish property rights with limited judicial review. If other property owners in Australia were subject to this sort of arbitrary and secret process in determining their rights over their land, those opposite would be among the first to complain. Instead, we see acquiescence and compliance by the Liberal Party with its WA branch in what I believe is the biggest property rort in our nation's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA legislation will no doubt be challenged in the High Court. While I do not underestimate the legal artwork that has gone into the WA act, even the smartest draftspersons have come undone before the High Court. We can but wait and see, but I would be very surprised if the High Court fails to see that the substance of the WA act deprives Aboriginal Western Australians of property rights and replaces them with inferior or worthless so-called traditional usage rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the current bill is a moderate and reasonable attempt to reconcile conflicting rights to land. It reflects our common law traditions of respect for property, which the High Court decision reasserted. It asks only of governments like that of Western Australia to give the people of their state access to an independent tribunal to determine land title questions. That tribunal will be guided by the principle of the High Court's decision which ensures native titleholders' rights are respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, industry's interests are also respected. A mining company operating on vacant crown land will be able to go to a tribunal and ask it to decide whether native title exists over the land. The legislation allows for speedy determination of these issues and encourages dialogue and discussion between the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most mine operations in Western Australia occupy very little land and disturbance of the surface is frequently minimal. The mining industry is no stranger to negotiating with landowners, local and state governments, environment groups and, of course, its customers here and overseas. In my meetings with industry interests and in the flurry of letters and faxes from some mining lobby groups, there appears to be an irrational fear of having to negotiate with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the mining industry is inherently racist and there is no doubt that, without the industry, Australia could not sustain its standard of living. However, I do think our industry can be excessively parochial and narrowly focused. When it can manage to get one state government to enact legislation like the WA act, which overturns Aboriginal rights in the most unconscionable way, one has to wonder whether the industry has it own interests at heart. What it has done is guarantee continuing instability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What could be more designed to turn Australians further away from industry than the WA act? Ill-informed members of the environment lobby based in Sydney or Melbourne have long pilloried the mining and forestry industries in particular. Just when the work of companies such as Alcoa in WA is being recognised as making a substantial contribution to reafforestation measures throughout the world, the industry manages to get itself offside with most fair-minded Australians. I believe that the industry should also avoid any further dabbling with public opinion surveys, which any professional will tell you are designed to produce a particular result and are of propaganda value only. Some elements in the industry who are driven more by religious zealotry than reason are simply giving their opponents free kicks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While groups such as the National Farmers Federation have worked within the Commonwealth system and have gained an understanding of its processes and are developing working relationships with people around the negotiating table, in WA,  the mining industry will be pinning its hopes on Mr Court's late night legislation. I suspect, however, that this same mining industry is heading into a dead end with the Court Land (Titles and Traditional Uses) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, if the Senate fails to pass this bill, Australia will be left without a comprehensive process for dealing with the Mabo decision. The queues to the High Court will not get any shorter and the writs will pile up in the various state supreme courts. The patience of Aboriginal people seems inexhaustible but I doubt whether industry and those Australians employed in it will be as tolerant or understanding of further delays in dealing with this issue. I sense a desire in the public for all of us to get on with it, to establish a process and encourage parties to resolve differences. That is what this bill is all about for most Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is not beyond those opposite to show some generosity of spirit, to welcome this long overdue decision by the High Court and to support the thoughtful and moderate response reflected in this bill; a response which does justice to the Mabo decision in protecting native title while, at the same time, ensuring a workable and certain land management system. I urge the Senate to support the bill. </PARA>

I want to take a moment to quote a wonderfully wise indigenous Australian Mr Wenten Rubuntja who, like me, is a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia&mdash;it's a beautiful country&mdash;hasn't got war, hasn't got riots, just people talking. Now we've got to be talking together about living together. Might be two laws&mdash;but only one place, one country, one people. We've got to look to our grandchildren sharing this country. That's the road we have to find.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what native title is about. In the Mabo judgment, Justices Deane and Gaudron said that the destruction of Aboriginal society had left Australia with a `national legacy of unutterable shame'. Echoing an election promise made nearly 20 years before by Gough Whitlam they said that `the nation as a whole must remain diminished' until past injustices are acknowledged and retreated from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So much of this debate has focused on whether or not particular comments or positions are racist, but it is important that we acknowledge that the main source of racism is not cultural difference in general but unequal power relations. While racism is expressed through prejudice, the purpose of the racist is not merely to vilify an outsider, but to reinforce the authority of one social group over another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of rhetoric about the inevitability and the desirability of the dispossession of indigenous peoples since white settlement, but that is nothing more than justification of power plays based on race. Anyone who looks behind the rhetoric can see the simple truth, stretching right back to 1888, when Sir Henry Parkes declined to invite Aborigines to the centenary celebrations with the words `and remind them that we have robbed them?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was for going behind the rhetoric and reminding us of this simple truth that the High Court has incurred such criticism in recent times. There is no denying that this rhetoric was founded on the lie of terra nullius and can be defended only by relying on an archaic and Eurocentric view of the world which denied responsibility for our real history. In the Mabo case, the High Court, to its credit, refused to do this. It refused to wash its hands of the truth in the name of precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early 1985, soon after the Hawke government dropped national legislation to enact land rights for all Aboriginal people, Justice Brennan reminded the political executive of its responsibility to ensure that rights and freedoms are shared by all Australians, whatever their racial group. I believe that men and women of goodwill in Australia in 1993 also believe that Aboriginal people are entitled to justice&mdash;not a justice that is qualified by the views of many of those in the opposition. Justice on their terms is where those with business interests have more rights than indigenous people and where land is nothing more than a tradeable commodity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1974 the Woodward royal commission into Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory concluded that `the doing of simple justice to a people who have been deprived of their land without their consent and without compensation' requires both `preserving and strengthening all aboriginal interests in land . . . which exist today' and `the provision of some basic compensation . . . for those Aborigines who have been irrevocably deprived of the rights and interests which they would otherwise have inherited'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Except for the Northern Territory, and except for the Pitjantjatjara lands of South Australia, this recommendation has been largely ignored. Until now, the Commonwealth has refused to use the overriding power it possesses to legislate for Aboriginal people, a power which Australian citizens gave it at the 1967 referendum. In February of 1975, shortly before the Racial Discrimination Act became law, the Senate unanimously passed a motion by former Liberal senator Neville Bonner&mdash;still the only Aboriginal elected to federal parliament&mdash;urging the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To admit prior ownership by the indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the peoples now known as Aboriginal and Torres Strait islanders.</PARA>
<PARA>It might be something of a record that it has taken us 18 years to respond to the context of that motion. I remind the Senate that it is a motion which the opposition voted for. So we have this legislation which begins to address the Senate's call&mdash;and, I believe, the community's even louder call&mdash;over the last 18 years for justice and reparation for Aboriginal Australians. But this Native Title Bill is only a beginning. It does not pretend to be anything more than that. Its purpose is to provide Australia with a means by which it can hear and determine native title claims and validate the interests of others who use and control land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Native title is nothing more than a traditional right based on occupancy which continues after the imposition of colonial sovereignty. The Crown can extinguish title through any grant of land to settlers or any use of land which is consistent with continuing traditional occupation. While native title is recognised by common law, its nature is determined according to the traditional customs of the native titleholders. The crucial issue of the extinguishment or abolition of native title depends upon the interaction of customary and common law, particularly the way in which the former is perceived by the latter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that Aboriginal title has disappeared over most of Australia, either because Aboriginal people have disappeared or lost their connection with the land, often in cruel and violent circumstances, or because the Crown has granted the land to other people or put it to uses inconsistent with native title. Most land in Australia is unaffected by the Mabo ruling and most Aboriginal people will not benefit directly from the ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the reprehensible scaremongering from some in the opposition, from some in the mining industry and from the Western Australian state government, people's backyards are not claimable under Mabo. A recent attempt by the Northern Territory media to deliberately confuse Australians by claiming that a case filed concerning some houses in a suburb of Darwin was somehow related to Mabo was spurious indeed. The claim was actually made under the heritage act. It may involve acts of bad faith on the part of the government in disposing of land some time ago, but it is not a native title claim. But it was an example of the upping of the ante on both sides of the debate which came from the original decision and the predictable responses to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority of the Mabo ruling rests not with the recognition of native title but flowing from the Racial Discrimination Act. It is imperative that in the process of validating existing titles, the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, especially in relation to compensation, should prevail. At this stage the Democrats intend to move an amendment to clarify that, should there be any ambiguity in future time, the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail because it provides protection for native title, and an overarching legislative and constitutional protection for that title is essential. It is essential to prevent capricious actions by state governments and, even in the foreseeable future, by the Commonwealth government itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mabo decision should have meant the recognition of bare legal rights for Aboriginal peoples and some attempt to provide redress for the 90 per cent of indigenous people who will not benefit from Mabo. That is why we believe that the social justice components which complement this bill are very important. Despite the desires of the opposition, we cannot separate native title from reconciliation. To do so displays a blatant lack of understanding of the special attachment that Aboriginal people have for land and that Torres Strait Islanders have for the sea. We cannot just say, `We are just going to deal with this and reconciliation can wait until we are finished'. Reconciliation is an ongoing process. How we respond to an understanding of special attachment to land is a measure of how we are performing our partnership as we move towards reconciliation. Because of this bill we are now in a position to give effect to rights and considerations long denied indigenous Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the most unworthy contributions to the fear and hatred whipped up around this legislation, in my opinion, was that of Geoffrey Blainey. There are fundamental fallacies to the argument that Aborigines have too much land. One of the wonderful ironies of Australian history is that most Aboriginal land is land that was unwanted by colonial settlers. It is land that is located in the most remote, inhospitable and desert areas of the country. But we suddenly discovered mineral resources on those lands, and suddenly those lands, on which we forced Aboriginal people, became desirable in our cultural context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land rights in Australia can no longer be about largess, sympathy or guilt. They are now about recognition and restoration of legal rights. This bill is not about creating land rights; it is about recognising and restoring them. Unfortunately, the fact is that there are some in this country who simply do not want to share in a new partnership, who have never accepted that the 1967 referendum means that indigenous peoples are full citizens entitled to the same rights and protections under the law as anyone else. These rights extend to land ownership and a special type of land tenure which recognises the special attachment to Aboriginal people. </PARA>

Instead, it would raise false expectations and hopeless demands among the great majority of Aborigines who can't claim native title anyhow. Most importantly, Mabo has to be kept in perspective. "It is not a basis for a national land rights policy, let alone a general Aboriginal policy," argued Mr Wootten. And while such wider policies are important, he said, they "cannot be an excuse to deny protection to the rights of those who still have their land".</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate that we must face today is crucial. I want to address it under three broad headings and considerations&mdash;what I term retrospective, introspective and prospective.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1967 the debate has raged on a number of occasions and a number of times across a wide range of issues. They culminated in the 1976 Aboriginal Land Rights Act for the Northern Territory. That was a very historic and important occasion in this parliament. It followed various reports&mdash;the Gibb report and the Woodward report&mdash;of the early 1970s. Again, I remind this chamber that when that 1976 legislation was passed there had been inadequate public debate and consideration of the recommendations of both the Gibb report and the Woodward report of the early 1970s&mdash;rather similar to the tensions and demands about the debate and acceptance in the community at this time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the Senate committee report the other night in this chamber, I commented about the conflicts and issues of Aboriginal people who still live in a ceremonial and traditional way, particularly in the Northern Territory. Since I made that speech, I have been challenged by the Reverend Djiniyini Gondarra of the Uniting Church of northern Australia and the Aboriginal Resource and Development Services. He was disappointed that I had quoted his material to the Senate committee with regard to the legislation, and he seemed to think that I was using his arguments to defer or delay the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak for the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory, some of whom hold a different view to mine. I make no apology for saying that the Reverend Gondarra and others would like to see this legislation go much further. None of the Labor Party amendments that have just been put into this chamber this morning addresses the issues that were raised by those Aboriginal people&mdash;so they have been sold down the river in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s the Uniting Church produced a major report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Free to Decide</EMPHASIS>, in which it recorded how Aborigines express their basic rights and concerns, their needs and expectations, and their relationships with those outside their culture. For Aborigines, those relations involve conflicts between cultures, the impact on the prevailing system and the tensions between traditional and modern aspects of Aboriginal community itself. Aboriginal responses are expressed in scattered communities&mdash;that is decentralisation&mdash;town structures and cultural responses. In addressing the particular issues of Aboriginal communities, the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such is the role of power in developing human and community potential, the problems of the `dependent' economy of a small isolated community, educational and vocational development in Aboriginal communities, the consequences of land rights, and the conflict of European law and Aboriginal tradition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That was in 1974 and I certainly remind Reverend Gondarra of that report of which I am sure he was a part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask: who are Aboriginal people today? One of the best commentaries I have seen on this is by an eminent physician and surgeon in the Northern Territory, Dr John Hargrave, who is well known for his work on leprosy amongst Aboriginal communities. I will quote his comments on Aboriginal Australia today. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, who are the modern Aborigines? That depends on where you come from. The people of Aboriginal descent from Sydney bear no resemblance to Bennelong or Arabanoo. Without mincing words, they are for the most part a brownish (or nearly white), urbanised people who have forgotten their language and know little of their past. By way of sharp contrast, the tribal Aborigines of Arnhem Land are clearly Aboriginal; the dialects they speak are their own and English is a second language. They know their past, they have retained their culture and they own their land. Between the two extremes, across Australia, is a spectrum which ranges from the totally detribalised or urbanised to those with clear identity. This present-day diversity often makes a decision that is acceptable to one group, totally unacceptable to another and since there is no truly credible national spokesman who represents all groups, this makes the problem still more complex. To be sure, there are influential local leaders, but as yet, the modern Aboriginal equivalent of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gandhi</EMPHASIS> has failed to emerge. The nearest we can come to Bennelong today, or even in the recent past are the Aborigines who flocked into Maningrida from the bush in 1957 and the Pintubi we saw at Lake McKay earlier that year.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, Dr Hargrave says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, however, there has been a progressive detribalization with consequent loss of identity (and we have seen it happen even in the Northern Territory) so that whether we like it or not, modern Aborigines are enormously diverse, with widely differing appearance, opinions, hopes and aspirations. This present-day diversity makes their chances of becoming an identifiable <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">`nation'</EMPHASIS> slimmer now than they were 200 years ago and a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">`Treaty'</EMPHASIS> ever more likely to be a divisive issue.</PARA>
<PARA>I find that an incredible summary of where we are and what we are addressing here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 in my maiden speech in the House of Representatives, I made a similar reference to the issues where we needed not to be confrontationist and also needed to guarantee that we did not lock Aboriginal people into an 18th century civilisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many problems with this legislation which the history of the Northern Territory over the last 20 years has certainly highlighted. These problems were brought to attention clearly by the Northern Territory Chief Minister, Mr Perron, in his evidence before the Senate committee several weeks ago. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You can imagine why we in the Northern Territory are so incensed at the Commonwealth government's refusal to pull the land rights act into line with the proposals under the Native Title Bill, which is described as a national, uniform response to the High Court's Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Territory has been left out as a social experiment once again within consistent rules. Mr Perron went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the enormous complexity of the Native Title Bill and its convoluted style and ambiguous language, together with the fact that seven governments, possibly dozens of Aboriginal funded organisations, industry groups and individual corporations will test every aspect of the bill through several layers of courts, I anticipate an enormous legal log jam . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Further on, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This giant legal bunfight will delay by years, possibly decades, the primary objective of this bill to secure a response to the High Court's decision which is acceptable to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pass legislation riddled with ambiguity and open to interpretation on a subject of such significance to Australia would be an abrogation of national leadership.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, Mr Perron and other Northern Territory ministers have addressed a whole range of problems that our experience of the last 20 years has led to&mdash;whether it is a national approach or a mining veto; the compulsory acquisition of land or stock routes and stockyards; river banks and beds; the control of waterways; the control of stock diseases, bushfires, soil conservation, noxious weeds, fences, firearms, public water supplies, public health, mining and petroleum exploration; the conflicts between Aboriginal freehold title in the territory, the owners, and Aboriginals with common law rights that will be abrogated by this legislation; or, importantly, mining confidence and investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence to the Senate committee by industry groups such as the mining community, the pastoral industry and the fishing industry appears to have been ignored by the Labor government. From my first cursory glance of the amendments here today, it appears that the government has certainly not addressed these important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is not even taking note of the important fundamental recommendations that were made by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody report. Many of the issues of psychology and mental illness will be exacerbated by this particular legislation and, as Mr Perron so rightly pointed out, Aboriginal people will get caught up in High Court actions for years and years because this legislation is basically inept and incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year of 1993 has been the year of indigenous people but I wonder to what extent we have been driven by an internationalist agenda. Certainly, everyone knows that I have been critical of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Mr Dodson, who appears to run off to Geneva at public expense once a year to get his running orders from some sort of international agenda. We need to look carefully at the rhetoric, the language, the amendments and the government's motives that address the issues of a separate state that would lead to self-government and autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difference between people participating and reflecting their proper self-determination in a community and, in effect, creating a different issue. The report of the Resource Assessment Commission on the coastal zone was tabled here last week. Again, it raises very serious issues in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the government's program or social justice package that it is not game to put on the table at the same time as this important legislation? It is going to hold that over to February. It is then going to create another major diversionary debate because no-one yet on the government side will be honest about what the formula is for the social justice package&mdash;nice rhetoric, nice words. But we know that the government has to find at least $12 billion in next year's budget. Where, therefore, will be the money for social justice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long Aboriginal people have been totally dependent on welfare and government support. Where is the commitment to private sector employment of Aboriginal people? How will that flow from this legislation? It will not. This legislation does not address that issue. In fact, more Aboriginal people are going to be employed within government agencies, within bureaucracies, that are going to create extreme problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly have a reputation in this parliament for pursuing the issues of accountability and scrutiny in Aboriginal affairs, because a black crook is no different to a white crook, and there has been such a dreadful history in the area of expenditure of funds. It was exposed yesterday in the Auditor-General's report into the Northern Land Council in which 52 recommendations were made to rectify fundamental errors in administration. The problems outlined in that report will be repeated again and again as they flow through into this legislation and the likely bureaucracies and all the other things that will be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be sure that the standards and the declarations that apply in company operations which are administered by the Australian Securities Commission apply equally to all Aboriginal communities and organisations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992-93 debate around the Mabo decision has not yet got through to the people who will be most affected by it, the traditional ceremonial Aboriginal; it is being run for a very different agenda. If we look again at the prospective issues, what type of future community do we want? The areas of discrimination in our community are basically alcohol related&mdash;violence and the other things that go with&mdash;or public health related, such as improving public health facilities, or to do with neighbourliness, issues such as noise, et cetera. They are the areas in which all Australians discriminate no matter where they live and they are problems that Aboriginal people experience just as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the prospective threat of the Keating agenda relating to republicanism and nationalism, which is now further exacerbated by this legislation and by the threat of Aboriginal self-government motivated by those who are running another secret agenda behind the scenes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should put ourselves 20 or 30 years ahead to the next generation and ask about the demography, the change and the numbers of people who are going to have an Aboriginal heritage, such as I do in my family and such as Senator Collins does in his. We should ask about the relationships of our children, their children, and what this legislation is going to do for them. Frankly, it will do nothing. It will cause division and, I believe, major problems in the future. This sociology, when a big sector of the community is totally dependent on the government nipple, cannot be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this going to do for the Prime Minister's thrust towards a very important relationship with Asia for Australia? It is creating a special class of people with different rules and regulations. How is that going to be seen through the eyes of Asians looking at us? The legislation is lousy; it does not meet any of the proper tests that should be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us on this side have argued consistently for a few months to remove the ambiguous confusion that will arise. In the next few days, when we are going to be looking at 100 or so amendments to the legislation that the government has put in place which arrived here this morning, which I have not had a chance to check or test with my constituency, I will proudly stand by the coalition's stance on this whole issue: the legislation is fundamentally flawed. It cannot meet the requirements of Aboriginal Australians or the Australian community in the form that is before the parliament. It needs to go back and be tested by basic fundamentals in each and every community around Australia. Whether it is industry related or Aboriginal community related, everyone has a stake in this legislation. </PARA>

But, by the same token, I have seen many other Australians equally disadvantaged through no fault of their own. It is very difficult for me and for most Australians to understand just why the assistance to the disadvantaged is not allocated on the basis of the extent of the disadvantage but rather on the basis of one's racial origin.

We in the opposition are opposing this bill because we sincerely believe it will create more problems than it will solve. The legislation flows from the High Court decision about land ownership on the island of Mer in the Murray Islands.

These people suffered at the hands of the pearlers, but they had a great capacity for retaliation. An example was to climb aboard pearling luggers at night and annihilate complete crews. It was the missionaries, much maligned&mdash;improperly&mdash;today, who convinced them that headhunting and cannibalism were not an acceptable form of social interaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that background, let us return to the High Court decision. That decision found that Eddie Mabo, who had lived in Townsville for 20 years and was blocked from returning to the Murray Island by his own people, had valid title to the land he claimed on Murray Island. The High Court dismissed the concept of terra nullius and indicated that others may have valid claims on the mainland of Australia under similar circumstances, but it did not define what would or would not constitute a valid claim. </PARA>

This in turn led to great uncertainty for all Australians who believed that they had valid title, and it destroyed investment confidence.

Those cheers will turn to tears when, as a result of that demise, their sources of incomes are cut off.

I mentioned earlier the claims made on the Bowen Basin. It is claimed that valid title exists where there has been a pastoral lease and that pastoral leases will extinguish valid title. However, there is a lot of doubt about this because the renewal of valid title is not often a legal right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of Queensland where land was acquired for mining purposes, in many instances, rather than purchase the land, purchase the grazing lease or take freehold, the landowner was compensated to return the land to the crown. The tenure exists only for the period of the lease which means that when it expires it is vacant crown land. That is of major concern. Over the years governments have limited the terms of leases in the hope that they could squeeze the companies further when the lease expired. It was just another tack by governments in years gone by. It raises the spectre of insecurity. </PARA>

The acquisition of the Gladstone power station and the expansion of the Boyne Island smelter were shelved and placed in jeopardy because of those doubts. Remarks have been made by other operators in the Bowen Basin that they have shelved any plans until this matter is clarified.

Clearly, this principle applies across Australia, and this is the real significance of the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time since Europeans colonised this continent and as a direct result of this High Court decision, Aboriginal people across Australia can walk tall.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill is the federal government's first response to the High Court's Mabo decision. In terms of the necessary balance between competing interests, achievable through the political process, the government has got it basically right, almost right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purposes of the bill are claimed to be, firstly, the recognition and protection of native title and, secondly, the validation of existing Commonwealth land titles where their validity may be at risk due to the confirmation of the existence of native title, and in particular since the enactment of the Racial Discrimination Act in 1975. It also provides for the right to compensation on just terms if native title is found to have existed, but is subsequently found to have been extinguished by the action of Australian governments. Thirdly, the bill establishes a set of procedures for determining claims to native title and, fourthly, it establishes procedures for dealing with native title once it is found to exist in relation to a particular piece of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court's Mabo judgment deals with the proof required to establish native title. The report from the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proof of the existence of native title is relatively difficult to establish. The elements include the need to show the existence of an identifiable community or group; that there be a traditional connection with the land under the laws and customs of the Aboriginal group; and that there has been a substantial maintenance of the connection since Crown sovereignty. These elements will place strict limits upon the making of successful claims to native title.</PARA>
<PARA>In recognition of this difficulty, and the fact that over most usable land in Australia native title has been extinguished, this bill contains a provision for the establishment of a land acquisition fund and the government has made a commitment to create a social justice package due to be introduced as the second leg of the government's response to Mabo. Both initiatives are intended to compensate those Aborigines who will not be able to claim native title. It is acknowledged that this is the majority of Aboriginal people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two initiatives are also in answer to those who say that Aboriginal people need better health, housing, education and other services rather than native title. The social justice package must be aimed at lifting these services to the standards the rest of the community enjoys. Unemployment and infant mortality rates twice as high as the rest of the population, and life spans two-thirds of ours cannot be tolerated any longer. However, the claim that in pursuing these objectives we should disregard the claim to native title ignores totally the extraordinarily important role played by land in Aboriginal culture and the relationship Aboriginal people have with their land as the basis for the cultural and spiritual life of individuals and their community as a whole. It is far removed from our concept of land. We see land mainly as an item of commercial value to be held, bought and sold for profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats will monitor closely the government's performance in relation to the land acquisition plan and the social justice package.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the Native Title Bill. Whilst agreeing with the basic thrust of the bill, I must point out that there are a range of amendments which are clearly necessary to ensure that the legislation meets the objectives agreed upon by the government and the main Aboriginal negotiating team. Certainly it was not possible for me to agree with the committee's majority report which advocated speedy passage of the bill as drafted. I firmly believe, however, that the bill must be passed in this parliamentary sitting. To leave it in limbo would give its opponents an opportunity to intensify their scare campaign and create a constituency bent on destroying the spirit and substance of Mabo. In this context, we should note the large number of leases now being granted in Western Australia under the WA native title legislation which, in fact, extinguishes native title and substitutes an inferior licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called fragile consensus could easily be blown away if more time were given to the reactionary elements in our community. Some people, with little or no hesitation, use racial prejudice, as is evidenced by the destructive campaigns in the past. Thus, speedy passage is indeed necessary and urgent. However, the bill is not good enough in some areas and before it can be passed, it requires a range of amendments to meet the concerns identified in consultations with Aboriginal and other community groups and industries and in discussions during the Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and foremost task is to ensure that the bill does not conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments which the Democrats believe are absolutely essential are those which guarantee that the Commonwealth Native Title Bill can override the WA legislation and other states' legislation which is in conflict with the basic principle. It is urgent that we all accept this. Amongst the other amendments that are necessary are those of the type that we have suggested to ensure that the compulsory acquisition provisions are not used to circumvent the intent of legislation to guarantee Aboriginal people access to native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Native Title Bill 1993. This bill will obviously be vastly different when we are eventually given the courtesy of being able to absorb all of the amendments that have just been distributed. I have had these amendments for something like 25 minutes. There are some 74 amendments to the government's legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government knew for many, many months that this piece of legislation was going to be around and yet we started debating this bill last night without the benefit of seeing these amendments. We started debating this bill again this morning&mdash;once more without the benefit of seeing these amendments. We had the most idiotic interjections from members of the government last night, who were saying, `What would change if you did see the amendments?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That purely and simply typifies the attitude of this government. It could not care less about the contempt with which it treats this parliament. Yet the Democrats and the Greens are quite happy to be compliant with this government's wish to totally and utterly disregard the effective debating of such an important piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clearly demonstrates the contempt which the Labor Party, the Greens and the Democrats have for this parliament. We still do not know the final product. I am on my feet talking 20 minutes or so after I received these amendments. I have not had a chance to have a look through them to see how they impact on the actual bill. Therefore, all I can do at the moment is operate on the piece of legislation that we have had before us. Quite frankly, even to consider trying to amend such a flawed piece of legislation to start with is absolutely and utterly pointless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will come as no surprise to anyone to learn that I wish to put the view of Western Australia, my home state. Western Australia is the state that is being totally and utterly disregarded by this Labor government and, sadly, by two other Western Australians senators&mdash;the Greens. I would have thought that, as new senators, they would have had a responsibility to their state of Western Australia. I would have thought that, as people who profess to look after the underdog, in many cases they would have had the decency to listen to the Aborigines&mdash;the people on the land who do not want a bar of this legislation. But what has happened? They have obviously been pressured by the government and particular interest groups in the Aboriginal industry to support this piece of legislation and not let it be sent off for further scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government continually avoids public scrutiny, and this is but another case of that. The Greens have equally disregarded the real interests of people who do not want anything to do with this legislation. Therefore, I do not think the Greens can ever claim to be concerned about the welfare of Aborigines when they declare that they will vote for this bill which will do the Aborigines no service; rather, it will do them a total and utter disservice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the reality of what can and should happen. The Western Australian legislation does serve a purpose in making sure that the interests of all Australians, particularly all Western Australians, are safeguarded. The Western Australian bill that was passed a few weeks ago in the Western Australian parliament is certainly an infinitely more workable solution to the High Court's decision than this bill will ever be. That Western Australian bill recognises the traditional use of land by Aboriginal people and, where traditional use is impaired or extinguished in any way, compensation will be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australians will have equal access to land titles. The acknowledgment of the traditional use of land by the Aboriginal people is to become part of formal process before title is approved. I might say that, contrary to what the Labor Party will try to have people believe, the new Western Australian law enshrines statutory rights to traditional use of land or water. As part of the approval process, Aboriginal people must be notified and become part of formal negotiations. That is a very important fact which is totally and utterly misrepresented, distorted and lied about repeatedly. We need to get the message across one way or the other, without having to listen to the bag of lies, that there is compensation and that there is consultation. If traditional Aboriginal use is extinguished or impaired, reasonable compensation will be paid. Therein lies the difference between what that bill does to protect the rights of Aboriginal people and what this bill does in terms of just ignoring many of the facts that should surround such a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My state of Western Australia generates 25 per cent of Australia's export income. That is not an insignificant amount, but it is an issue that is totally disregarded and ignored by this Labor government. It is the largest export income earning state&mdash;another factor totally ignored by this Labor government. It produces, per head $9,000 worth of exports each year and the national average is $3,500. That is totally and utterly disregarded by this Labor government. Private investment in Western Australia has escalated at a rate of 30 per cent, compared with the national growth rate of 6.4 per cent. New investment by the private sector is increasing at five times the national average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not hear any galahs on the other side saying that that is something that should be downgraded, that we should try to bring Western Australia's investment down to the national average. But, effectively, that is what will happen if this bill is put through in its current form. It is estimated that as much as 43.89 per cent of the state of Western Australia, or over one million square kilometres of land, is at stake. Does someone from Tasmania or Victoria worry about that? Not in the slightest, because they are not affected. It is nothing short of outrageous for them, in supporting a piece of legislation such as this, to get on some high horse or sit on a pedestal and claim that they have an intimate knowledge of this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If pastoral leases were added to that figure, the total Western Australian land in contention would rise from 43.89 per cent to 78.88 per cent. More than 15 per cent of Western Australia is already subject to Mabo-style claims. I would have thought that every Australian would have been most concerned about exactly what was going to happen to much of the developments in the tourism industry and many of the other wealth producing industries in Western Australia and in Australia generally. But the bill that we are debating today will simply be unworkable in Western Australia. It completely fails to acknowledge in any way the special land title arrangements and industry structure of the state. The bill also fails to recognise the most fundamental of points&mdash;that is, the significance of the state's resource industries, how those industries rely on certainty of title and how the uncertainty impacts on the entire industry and future investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing, and have already seen through the uncertainty that this Labor government has sought to create&mdash;and I say that quite deliberately&mdash;is investment going offshore. I would have thought this Labor government had a pretty flash record already of driving this country downward instead of upward and backward instead of forward. But it has not been satisfied to do that over the past 10 years. It spent another year ensuring that, through the uncertainty of the whole Mabo issue, the country will go further backward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill raises the levels of concern about the economic impact because it really does add to the complexity and the uncertainty. There are many mining companies which simply say, `We are not going to invest while there is this uncertainty'. Yet we have the Democrats and the Greens aiding and abetting this uncertainty and the reduction of investment in this country. How they can sit here in this parliament, elected by the people to serve the people in their best interests, and support something that will be a negative for Australia and Australia's investment and therefore jobs and security, is beyond me. I simply cannot understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of trying to resolve these concerns by allowing sufficient time for community consultation on the actual bill, this wad of amendments and all the silly amendments put up by the Australian Democrats et al, we will have this rammed through prior to Christmas. The legislation is not the type of legislation that should be rammed through in such a short period. There is no point in any person in the Labor Party saying, `You've had adequate time to have a look at it'. We got the amendments 20 minutes ago. So how much time does that give us to have a look at it? So there is no point in anyone trying to defend it. But we will have it rammed through because Australia's most arrogant and supercilious Prime Minister has said there would be `the difficulty of holding together the necessary coalitions of interests&mdash;the fragile consensus' if the bill were deferred until February or March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is such a fragile consensus, surely the people of Australia have the right to know and understand its contents more fully. The Prime Minister recognises that, but this says it all. Vainglorious and all as the Prime Minister is, he at least knows that the voices of concerned and affected Aborigines will be heard loudly and clearly if there is time for greater scrutiny. He also knows, in his pontifical way, that more and more concern will be expressed by Australians in general and by investors. What this bill is doing, like so many other pieces of legislation coming from the Labor government, with the aid of the Democrats, is getting the Commonwealth involved in land management, which has always been, and should be, the exclusive domain of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the uncertainty for investors. I also mentioned mining companies moving offshore. The President of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Allister McLeod, has said that more than 30 per cent of mining companies listed on the Australian Stock Exchange are currently involved in overseas operations, compared with less than 10 per cent 15 years ago. That is a classic example of what this Labor government has done. Yet the government prides itself on sending investment offshore. It virtually prides itself on increased unemployment, which is the net by-product of what it has done by forcing investment offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has created such an aura of uncertainty that the Foreign Investment Review Board reported that resource processing in 1991-92 was down to $59 million, compared with $870 million in 1990-91. Investors in the mining industry are certainly looking away from Australia. They have simply lost confidence. Last year, only eight small projects, valued at $510 million, began. The previous year, 11 new mines started, generating $2.6 billion in development expenditure. That is $2.6 billion one year earlier, compared to $560 million the following year. Is that not a great achievement by a Labor government, just to make sure that there are fewer jobs, just to make sure that there is less security for people? It is a deliberate attempt to grind this country into the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining and petroleum explorationists simply will not bother. Why should they under this Labor government? Why should they under this legislation? If they must go through the same exercise in Western Australia as they have had to go through in Papua New Guinea or other countries where traditional owners must be identified and agreements reached with them and so forth, they may as well be working in Papua New Guinea, where the prospects and financial rewards are better. One of the significant reasons for Western Australia's success in mining during the past decade has been the ease of access to land. That is why the Western Australian government has sought to reach a position whereby the Aboriginal communities are assured of land but they are also assured of compensation. We are constantly having furphies put forward by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the issue of pastoral leases. Forty-three per cent of Australia's land mass is held under pastoral lease, and Western Australian pastoral leaseholds affect 55 per cent of the state and cover 95 million hectares. The impact of the Native Title Bill simply cannot be underestimated in this case. Aboriginal interests already own 14 per cent of Australia and 13 per cent of Western Australia. Aboriginal negotiators are saying that just five per cent of their people will benefit from the High Court decision. Twelve and a half thousand people&mdash;0.075 of one per cent&mdash;is the number we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his cohorts do not want to hear the case put forward by the very people whom John Hewson and many of us visited in the remote parts of Australia this year. When Dr Hewson and some of us shadow ministers went up to the north of Western Australia, we spoke to many Aboriginal communities who wanted not a bar of this Mabo decision. They simply wanted to be left alone to run their properties in the successful way in which they had been running them in the past. Of course, over in the Labor Party, they do not want to hear this side of the story. In other words, to gag those people&mdash;the very Aborigines who do not want a bar of this bill&mdash;they will ram it through the parliament before Christmas. That is totally and utterly unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have, in my nine years in this place, talked to many of the Aborigines in Western Australia who do not like the way in which they are treated by this Labor Government. They want to get something done. They do not want to be part of some nanny state and they do not want the white advisers telling them what to do. They want to have an opportunity to do what they do well. Senator Collins can perform like a trained seal over there, huffing and puffing and blurting about, but he knows full well that there are Aboriginal communities who do not want any part of this legislation. It is not in the interests of Western Australia. We will not countenance amendments; we will not be putting forward amendments; we will simply be voting against legislation that is not in the interests of Western Australia and is most certainly not in the interests of wider Australia. </PARA>

In all this debate, average Australians have been left out. I speak as an average Australian, a member of the community, who&mdash;like nearly everybody else&mdash;has had nothing to do with the Aboriginal community. It was an eye-opener to me last year when I undertook, as part of my duties, to go around the Aboriginal communities of Queensland. For the first time in my life, at my age, I became acquainted with what is occurring in those communities. It was one of the most fascinating experiences of my life, and it is to my shame that I had not done it previously. The only reason that I had that opportunity is that I am a member of this chamber.

It was a great privilege to have done it, and I learned something from it. Average Australians have no concept of what this is all about, no concept whatsoever. They are starting to get concerned about the rush to judgment that is going on with the legislation that is coming through. They want to know how it is going to affect them, and the hackles on the backs of their necks are getting up at the thought of what might occur as a result of this. Average Australians do not believe that this bill will achieve reconciliation with the Aboriginal community. Average Australians are comfortable with what is occurring within the community, but they are concerned about the problems the Aboriginal communities have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I went around these communities in Queensland, it was interesting to see that half of the Aboriginals are in community areas and the other half are in an urban situation, absorbed into the communities in one way or another, albeit unhappily and unsuccessfully.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ninety per cent of those that are in those communities are not affected by this legislation. There are only 75,000 Aboriginals in Queensland, and their problems vary. I once told Senator Collins, for whom I have a great deal of respect, that I had learnt what immense diversity exists in the Aboriginal community in Queensland and that every community was different. I am sure he will not mind my quoting his response, which was, `You are starting to get a bit of wisdom in relation to this matter'. I acknowledge the truth of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then I have taken a keen interest in everything that has been said in both chambers. I think any solution to the problems faced by the Aboriginals has to come from the Aboriginals themselves; it is not going to come from white Australians. We have been shoving money at them&mdash;$1.3 billion, on the latest estimate&mdash;but when one goes into these communities it is apparent that, somewhere along the line, it is not getting to the people in the communities. I do not know where it is going but, as Senator Knowles, the previous speaker, pointed out, a lot of it is being shunted off into administration. It is being used by people who seem to represent no-one but themselves. I have seen blue-eyed flaxen-haired white Aboriginals in some communities that had been infiltrated once the Aboriginal community had been accepted by the local community. These are facts that are apparent to all of those who have had direct involvement. It is a very great problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not digress to the health problem of the Aboriginal community. It is an enormous problem in some communities and in other communities it is not. There are certain communities where the opportunity has been grasped, and it would do a lot of us good to see some of those communities that have taken the money and are using it properly by getting the young people to work for the dole and do road construction. How these problems are dealt with depends on the people themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no difficulty with the prospect of reconciliation, if that is the word to use, but it will not be achieved by this bill. It will be achieved only when the average Australian understands and is conversant with the situation. The average Australian sees the litigation that is going to go on in the same light as does one of my close and respected friends, who believes that it will be a dark day in Australia's history when this legislation goes through and that it will be looked back upon, in years to come, as impeding the reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am upset when I read in the speeches of members of the government in the other chamber that they are proud to be members of the government as this legislation is going through. When we look back in 10 years we will realise what a total shambles has been produced by the legislation before us. I saw somewhere that Mabo&mdash;I did not say that I would not use that word&mdash;stood for `money available, barristers only'. Certainly, that is an impression the average Australian has in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with the statement I made previously: reconciliation will not occur until the Aboriginal communities themselves take responsibility for their health care, take responsibility for their employment, take responsibility for controlling their own lives in the way that other Australian communities do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the legislation, I ask: what will it do for our nation? Will it improve the lifestyle of the average Aboriginal? Will it improve the job prospects of Aboriginals? Will it improve their health? Will it improve the manner in which they react with the rest of the community?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court's Mabo decision never promised to right 205 years of wrongs between Aboriginal and white Australia; nor, I am sure, did the judges expect it to do so. It was a particular case with a peculiar history, with the Murray Islands in mind. We accept the High Court's decision, but it never promised reconciliation between black and white Australians. It did promise, however, to provide a major challenge to the federal government to come up with a reasoned and realistic approach to the decision. It can be seen now that this challenge was beyond the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He has failed in the challenge and in doing so has raised expectations to unrealistic levels. He has failed in the most important legislation to come before this parliament in recent times. His endless somersaults have culminated in an unworkable, unrealistic, untenable document that will divide this nation by law. I repeat: it will divide this nation by law. He has failed to build on the `fragile consensus' that the government itself says is essential. The Prime Minister has created a situation where one group of Australians has been set apart from another group of Australians. We are under threat of being a house divided; and, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, a house divided against itself cannot stand. At a time when we should be drawing together, we are creating the seeds of social disharmony that this country does not need or deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Prime Minister is a very divisive man. An overwhelming percentage of Australians believe everybody should be treated equally in terms of land title; an overwhelming percentage of Australians believe that land management should remain a state responsibility; and an overwhelming percentage of Australians believe that native title holders should not have special rights of permanent ownership. Any resolution of the issues raised by Mabo should proceed on the basis that all Australians are entitled to equal treatment under the law. There appears to be some doubt about that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We live in the best nation on earth, relatively free of racial tension, political problems and other serious difficulties; but we now face a substantial threat to our future as a cohesive sovereign state. I believe that; the great majority of Australians believe that; a substantial number of Aboriginal Australians believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first fundamental error the Prime Minister has made is to cause an enormous amount of concern to miners and farmers, predominantly in Queensland and Western Australia. Some companies have already moved divisions of their operations overseas; others are not investing while uncertainty remains, and they will leave if a credible solution is not found. The National Farmers Federation has not fully appreciated the differences in protection for freehold and leasehold land. The first time a forestry or pastoral lease comes up for grabs, the National Native Title Tribunal could well be asked to grant native title on the basis of a valid coexistence of native title and other rights. This is contrary to the undertaking to primary producers that pastoral leases will be safe. There is no certainty here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has grossly overstepped the High Court. The fundamental error he has made in responding to the High Court's decision is to tie reconciliation and the question of compensation to his revision of our land management system. I believe he has done this to give respectability to his native title package, because he continues to believe that a fair and equitable solution for Aboriginal Australians is provided mainly by money; that money is the panacea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money has never been the answer and, even if it were, this government&mdash;and, in fact, every government&mdash;appears to be incapable of effectively targeting help for disadvantaged groups. Millions and millions of dollars have been wasted and will continue to be wasted in the attempt to identify areas of need. Honourable senators would all have first-hand knowledge of situations where Aboriginal funds have been wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few people in Australia would deny that Aborigines are among the most disadvantaged in our community. The living conditions of, and opportunities for, many Aborigines are a national disgrace. However, the living conditions of, and opportunities for, many white Australians are not much to be proud of either. We must have the courage to tackle Mabo and these social issues separately if we are serious about addressing the urgent need to improve the standard of living of all Australians, but particularly of Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this era of political correctness the following figures probably do not sit comfortably, but they are the truth and I do not shy away from them. In the 16 years from 1971 to 1986, the median age for Aboriginal school leavers increased by only 10 weeks. That is an incremental increase of only 3 1/2 school days per year. The jobless rate for Aboriginal men went from 6.6 per cent in 1971 to 32 per cent in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Aboriginal people still earn only half the income earned by white Australians. The life expectancy of Aborigines is 20 years less than that of other Australians. Child mortality for Aborigines is three times higher than the national average, and yet the amount of money allocated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has ballooned from $24 million in 1971 to $1.3 billion annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before social security expenditure exploded, in a time when there was comparative goodwill and cohesion in this nation, Aboriginal identity generated considerably more pride than it does today. No-one would honestly dispute that. Aboriginal Australians were disadvantaged then, but at least at that time they had some dignity. They had dignity because the handout mentality, for which all Australian governments can be blamed, had not developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now reconciliation can come only from the Aborigines themselves. The Aboriginal industry&mdash;the hangers-on, the do-gooders, the social engineers&mdash;should get off the backs of the Aborigines. They are the people who continually tell Aboriginal Australians that they are hard done by, and they confirm it in perpetuity as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving some Aborigines native title will not help the thousands of other Aborigines who will not be eligible. It appears that only between five and 10 per cent of the 250,000 Aborigines in Australia will have a chance to claim land under the Mabo decision. In other words, less than a quarter of one per cent of the Australian population may benefit from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal Australians already have property rights to 14 per cent of our landmass. That is the equivalent of a seventh of the landmass for less than two per cent of the total population, and I understand that there are land claims for another 12 per cent of the country. Presently, the area held by Aborigines in one form or another covers just over one million square kilometres: an area as large as Victoria and New South Wales combined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined total area of the land now held and claimed by Aborigines is as large as the area covered by the three eastern states. I believe that the principle of one people and one nation should apply to every person living in this country, no matter what his or her racial origin. A nation of minority groups with separate agendas can only lead to national destruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Mabo legislation which is now being considered, the Prime Minister has handed a blank cheque to Aboriginal Australians at the expense of all taxpayers. Very little has been made public about the cost of the package. Michael Mansell is reported to have said that $200 million might not scratch the surface with respect to financing the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister fails to realise that this commitment will cost all Australian taxpayers&mdash;both black and white&mdash;dearly. It will create unprecedented racial tension. Australia is well known as an egalitarian society, and clearly this legislation threatens the very fabric of our society. It must not be allowed to become law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has been very critical of Premier Court's state legislation, but the truth is that the Western Australian position is more consistent with the Mabo judgment than is Mr Keating's bill. The replacement of native title with a statutory title which identifies the land usage that is appropriate is a sensible compromise. With the Prime Minister's bill, we are facing legislation that will create a bureaucratic nightmare and will consume millions and millions of dollars a year in administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucracy created will involve a complex series of tribunals, assessors and registrars. In its wake will be a mass of dissatisfied people: Aboriginal Australians with a claim to native title; dispossessed urban Aborigines hoping for money from the land acquisition fund; and always the great majority of Australians, all shaking their heads. Our job is to look to the future and work towards providing better prospects for everybody. That is why each and every one of us is in politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a country, we face enough problems outside our shores without tearing ourselves apart internally. We must get on with the job and address issues that affect all Australians, such as the enormous waste of talent in our one million unemployed. Australia's wealth is vast, both in its resources and in its population. We must capitalise on this. The grab for power&mdash;at the expense of the constitutional rights of the states for land management&mdash;inherent in the Native Title Bill will cost Australian taxpayers dearly. Except for the need to validate titles, the real motive for this bill is to significantly go beyond the Mabo decision, which has already declared that native title exists and has given a guarantee to indigenous Australians that the courts will act to protect native title. In his usual arrogant manner, Mr Keating has gone off on an unrealistic tangent and his attitude will be disastrous for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for a right of negotiation which amounts to a de facto right of veto. This will impede economic development in this country. It puts at risk our biggest export earners in the agricultural and mining industries. In relation to mining, it will create massive uncertainty in investment, and produce unworkable delays and huge compliance costs. The Australian economy will suffer badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week, 16 chief executive officers of major Australian companies confirmed that the Native Title Bill is both unworkable and inconsistent with the High Court's Mabo ruling. That the High Court has changed the property law of Australia is not in doubt; the great change is that the High Court's decision provides no certainty to existing titleholders. These 16 executives included Mr John Prescott, Managing Director of BHP, who is reported to have said that reading the bill was a little like reading porridge. They argued that the certainty the Prime Minister promised is not provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, they believe that existing titles must be properly validated and that a workable and fair system for future land dealings must be established. Secondly, they assert that the legislation is far too complex and will lead to uncertainty because of its very nature, since it appears to be legislation that is all things to all people. I would add that good legislation is simple legislation and that the complexity of this must lead to the conclusion that the government is hiding behind its own uncertainty. Thirdly, they argue that traditional state responsibility for land management and title should not be confused with other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We would all agree that improvements should be addressed for health care, education, job opportunities, and all other inequities that exist in this comparatively fair country. But those improvements should not be addressed in this porridge-like legislation. The Prime Minister's view on leadership&mdash;his modus operandi, if you like&mdash;is to crash through regardless. He has pushed this incredibly complex legislation through to distract us from the more pressing issues of unemployment and economic stagnation, and to appear to be doing something. I will be generous to him and say that he is doing this possibly through a genuine desire to provide some certainty, but he is mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will make land management very difficult and it leaves open more questions than it answers. It will require a great deal of intervention by the courts. This will lead to considerable delay, expense and, above all, uncertainty. This uncertainty will jeopardise development and may well diminish and delay investment. It will reduce economic activity and growth. It will divert investment from Australia. All Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, will bear the ultimate cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's land usage has changed beyond comprehension in the 205 years since the beginnings of Western civilisation in this distant land. We could not turn the clock back even if we wanted to. I bear no historical guilt, but I do bear responsibility for the future. That future requires Australia to be able to take its place among the most advanced Western nations. To do that, we must keep an agricultural base that is already feeding 50 million to 60 million people through exports essential for our survival and the requirements of domestic food consumption. We must have a land management policy that allows that to continue. It is not helped by this Native Title Bill, which is an expensive exercise in gladhanding so complicated that the Prime Minister thinks he has fooled us and wishes to rush it through.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will not provide the dignity and respectability that I wish for Aboriginal Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Native Title Bill is the government's response to probably the most controversial and revolutionary decision by the High Court in its history. Without doubt the Mabo judgment has caused more confusion, uncertainty and division than any other decision by that court. It quite clearly has upset a very long tradition of evolution, not revolution, in the development of the common law in this country. It is clear that this decision has politicised the High Court like no other. It is interesting to observe that in its most recent judgment in the Capital Duplicators case, which concerned the issue of excise, the court has been far more pragmatic in its attitude than it was in the Mabo judgment. The majority in the Capital Duplicators case said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerations of certainty and the ability of legislatures and governments to make arrangements on the faith of the Court's interpretation of the Constitution are formidable arguments against a reconsideration of Dennis Hotels and Dickensons Arcade.</PARA>
<PARA>They were the cases that underpinned the states' right to impose licence fees. I regard it as a considerable pity that such considerations of certainty which weighed upon the court in that case were not as influential in the Mabo judgment. It is often overlooked by commentators and others in the Labor Party that one very prominent and well-respected member of the High Court, Mr Justice Dawson, actually gave a dissenting judgment in Mabo; he did not agree with the ultimate judgment. There are two most significant passages in Mr Justice Dawson's judgment, and I would like to put them on the record. At page 145 of his judgment, in talking about the history of European settlement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A dispassionate appraisal of what occurred is essential to the determination of the legal consequences, notwithstanding the degree of condemnation which is nowadays apt to accompany any account. The policy which lay behind the legal regime was determined politically and, however insensitive the politics may now seem to have been, a change in view does not of itself mean a change in the law. It requires the implementation of a new policy to do that and that is a matter for government rather than the courts. In the meantime it would be wrong to attempt to revise history or to fail to recognise its legal impact, however unpalatable it may now seem. To do so would be to impugn the foundations of the very legal system under which this case must be decided.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, that is what occurred. Mr Justice Dawson concludes in his judgment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any traditional land rights which the plaintiffs may have had were extinguished under the assumption of sovereignty by the Crown over the Murray Islands and any fiduciary or trust obligation that might otherwise have existed in relation to such rights is precluded by the terms of the relevant legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>So, in my view, the majority decision was truly revolutionary in overturning the system of land title in this country. We acknowledge that judges make law, but they should certainly never be revolutionaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think ordinary Australians instinctively sense that in that judgment the High Court went way beyond what is the norm for that court. I think the High Court and the government are quite out of step with public opinion. We are here as representatives of the public and of their opinions and the government is completely out of step with current public opinion. A Newspoll in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 24 November showed that 67 per cent of Australians believed that the government should be holding a referendum to decide the outcome of the native title issue. That is an overwhelming expression of public opinion against the direction the government has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians, I believe, have an innate sense of fairness. They are very suspicious about this judgment and this bill in the sense that it creates a new form of title which is inherently racist, and it is racist because only people of a particular race can now claim this new title. That is a completely foreign concept to Australians, who have a very deep sense of egalitarianism. They believe that the rule of law should apply equally to all of us, regardless of the colour of our skin, and certainly should not condone a system whereby one's title to land can be determined by one's race. That is a concept which, if we asked ordinary Australians in the street, they would associate with South Africa and not with this country. Australians, certainly, are happy to have resources directed to Australian Aboriginals as individuals to the extent that they need assistance, like any other individual Australian, but to single them out as a group and base assistance on the colour of their skin is a foreign concept to Australians. They innately sense that there is something wrong with a form of title based on race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings us to consideration of the government's response to the judgment, the Native Title Bill. It is the coalition's strongly held view, and I think it is backed up by a majority of Australians and by many Aborigines, that this is bad law and cannot be supported. It is an unbelievably complex bill. It will now challenge the Income Tax Assessment Act for the title of the most extraordinarily complex legislation on the books. The explanatory memorandum is in two parts and runs to 118 pages, and even has to have diagrams so that we simple legislators can understand what it is we are passing. The bill itself is 115 pages long and there are no fewer than 24 pages of definitions in it. It will no doubt be the most extraordinary picnic the lawyers of this country have had handed to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The racism I refer to in the Mabo judgment is carried through and consolidated in the bill, and there are a couple of examples of that. Under this bill, the Federal Court is required to appoint assessors to assist it in its processes. These assessors are, as far as practicable, to be Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders. In other words, the bill provides that these judicial officers are to be appointed on the basis of their race; it is a strictly racist basis for the appointment of officers of a court. That is an utterly offensive provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the bill instructs the Federal Court to take account of the cultural and customary concerns of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders and `is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence'. What an unbelievable instruction from the parliament to the judiciary. It is a most reprehensible undermining of a superior court of this country, and really is, at its essence, contrary to the whole principle of the separation of the executive, legislature and judiciary. As I say, it confirms that this bill is fundamentally based on race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of necessity, this legislation must raise the issue of the definition of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. After all, a native title claimant has to be of the relevant race, just as an assessor appointed to the Federal Court has to be of the relevant race. We then run into the problem of how we define a person of that race. How does the court decide whether a given person is actually of the race that is prescribed in the bill? The bill does provide a definition among the 24 pages of definitions, but it is utterly useless. It says that Aboriginal peoples means peoples of the Aboriginal race of Australia. What an utter non-sequitur; it is meaningless. In my view, this race-based law is highly dangerous to this country, and I think we are setting off a very dangerous powder keg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another major objection to this bill, and that is its very destructive impact on federalism. The Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens have absolutely no respect for the federal compact that underlies this country and its constitution. They would happily see the states disappear and see us become a unitary state. This bill takes that process one very unfortunate step further. This is an extraordinary interference in the states' responsibilities for land management and represents a profound undermining of the sovereignty of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is distressing that this is another nail in the coffin of our federal system. I do not know why it is that the Left of this country has such a paranoia about federal structures. There are many successful federal structures around the world. It is one of the greatest safeguards against the arbitrary use of power. I would have thought people of the Left would be the greatest guardians of that and therefore of federalism. To the extent that it impinges on the states, it raises very significant constitutional questions, which others on this side will be raising. The bill could well be unconstitutional. It will, no doubt, lead to significant constitutional problems over the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an objection which must be raised by a country with the kinds of economic problems this one has, and that is an objection to the very cost of this whole process, which the government has ignored. The financial impact section in the explanatory memorandum is a mere 10 lines in 118 pages of bill, yet this must be one of the most important considerations. There are very vague statements about the financial impact of this bill. They suggest that the financial impact on the Commonwealth is completely open ended. We have the cost of establishing what will clearly be a vast new bureaucracy. The bill itself says that it is not possible to identify the amount of any direct liability for compensation the Commonwealth may have. So this parliament is literally being asked to sign a blank cheque. It does go on to say that these sums may be considerable. That is reassuring!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, with its $16,000 million deficit and another huge deficit forecast for next financial year, does not have any idea of how much the taxpayers of this country are going to be up for as a result of the passage of this bill and is asking us to sign a blank cheque. That does not even take account of the land acquisition fund, for which we are going to legislate next year. It is going to be provided with `significant capital'. What on earth does that mean? The bill also contemplates a very big liability falling on the states and territories. That is not costed. The states are all running deficits. Their taxpayers are paying taxes they cannot afford. Yet they are being told that they will be up for immeasurable sums of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular objection I refer to relates to the bill's effect on pastoral leases. I represent the state of South Australia, which has a vested interest in this issue. Forty-three per cent of the land mass of South Australia is leasehold, most of that being pastoral leases. So it is an issue of great significance to the state I represent. The government has been boasting of the support it has received for this bill from the Executive Director of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Rick Farley. I had the dubious pleasure of attending a meeting of an NFF group in the far north of South Australia in the last couple of weeks, which was addressed by Mr Farley. The pastoralists who attended that meeting, who represent a vast slice of South Australia, certainly told Mr Farley what they thought of his support for the government. That meeting passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Farley as a result of his support for this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Farley and the government were unable to answer the leaseholders' very legitimate fears about this bill. He and the government can give absolutely no satisfaction on the question of pre-1975 leases, which are the overwhelming majority of pastoral leases. This bill does not validate such leases, so there is automatically a very big question mark over the status of those leases. Pastoralists, like every other Australian, having been dudded by this government and fooled by this government on so many issues, are simply not going to accept the government's view that there is no problem with pre-1975 leases. Why on earth would they simply trust the government in expressing this view?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no guaranteed security for the whole of the pre-1975 leases. What happens when current pre-1975 leases expire? Again we have no idea; there are just vague assurances from the government. Pastoralists investing money to employ Aborigines on their pastoral leases get no security of tenure from this bill at all. Mr Farley could not answer questions about the effect on the value of leases of current claims. There are current claims over pastoral leases in South Australia, and there will no doubt be future claims. He could not give any assurances about the effect of such claims on the value of those leases or about whether or not such claims would be withdrawn. He could give no assurances about the prospects of coexisting rights being granted by tribunals hearing claims for native title. That is a major concern for pastoral leaseholders. Again, there is no satisfaction on that issue in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no satisfaction either, nor was there from Mr Farley, on the potential legal costs for pastoralists who might, either voluntarily or otherwise, be joined in actions affecting their leases under this bill. Mr Farley, as I say, could not give satisfactory answers, nor can the government. From the perspective of South Australian pastoral leaseholders whom I have the privilege of representing, this bill is wholly unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the opposition opposes this bill because, in essence, it is bad law; it is racist law; it is centralist; it is highly divisive; and it is complex. I think it is potentially a financial time bomb and we cannot accept the proposition that we will be asked to sign a blank cheque. From a political point of view&mdash;and I cannot understand the government not taking it into account&mdash;I think this legislation does have the potential, on its own, to end the prospects of this government at the next election. I think it is that explosive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition thought very long and hard about its policy on Mabo and that was set out in the statement released by our leader on 18 November. That policy provides a just, workable and practical&mdash;and I emphasise `practical'&mdash;response to the High Court judgment. It is a response which is eminently preferable to this bill, and this bill should be rejected. </PARA>

Of course, government senators are seeking to save as much time as possible because of the very busy schedule the Senate has before it and to ensure that this great legislation is, in fact, passed.

In my first year here, it is very pleasing to be able to say that great measures have been introduced, the industrial relations legislation and this matter being but two. In my experience, many Labor Party members would be very pleased to have the opportunity to participate in great historic moments such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill starts to address the problems faced by the Aboriginal people of this country. In this debate, it is often said that we should shy away from concern about the shameful things that have occurred in the history of this country; we should not be motivated by the so-called guilt industry; we should not adopt the so-called black arm band school of history. What has to be understood&mdash;particularly in terms of the electorate that I represent in this chamber&mdash;is that savage wars were fought in this country. Great casualties were inflicted upon the native inhabitants of this country. There were many thousands of deaths in those wars, particularly in the southern part of this continent. Whole generations of people were removed from the face of the earth in our move as a society to invade and to conquer this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indigenous people of this country suffered enormously in that war and, as a consequence of their defeat in war, they lost possession of their country. This is important, especially in the southern parts of this continent, where many people have misunderstood what actually has happened in our history. In the Western District of Victoria, and in Gippsland, littered across the landscape are sites of massacres and of battles fought throughout the 19th century. It is not just for recognition of that that we should be embarked upon a course of action such as we are on today, because not to recognise that would be shameful but, in my view, if we were to do nothing about the future, which is the real issue, we would be suffering an enduring guilt as to our responsibilities to this country as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my judgment, this particular bill before the chamber is historic legislation. It is legislation with enormous implications for the indigenous people and, of course, for non-indigenous Australians. It lays the foundation for a real and lasting justice for both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, while establishing a just and workable framework for land management. The High Court ruling on Mabo was remarkable in that it recognised that some Aboriginal people still have rights, despite the destruction and dispossession of their culture. The Native Title Bill acknowledges that within the law; it acknowledges the historic legacy; and it outlines clear mechanisms for dealing with native title claims in the future. This bill will set a solid foundation for a genuine reconciliation between black and white Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the historic context in which we are operating, and the more recent developments since the 1967 referendum, it is important to recognise that this government is doing more than just talking about change. It is actually moving in a historic and courageous way to address those basic issues of social justice for all Australians. Taken in the historical context, this step forward has developed over quite a considerable period. It has been more than 20 years since the federal referendum in which 97 per cent of Australian people&mdash;an overwhelming majority&mdash;voted that Aboriginal people had the right to become citizens. Indigenous Australians are still the most disadvantaged Australians despite that. What this measure does is move towards closing Australian society to ensure that all people are able to participate within it and be more actively involved; and allowing all people who live in this country to be part of that society. Of course, in doing that we have to recognise that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people still suffer enormous disadvantages and enormous injustice in terms of unemployment rates, health, education and basic housing. No matter what measure is chosen, those disadvantages are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly for people in the south of Australia, this legislation provides enormous opportunities, but not necessarily for the granting of land through the claiming of native title, as has been indicated by other honourable senators here. This legislation will not do much in terms of just claiming a title for the Yorta Yorta people in Victoria&mdash;that is, unless their claim is actually granted; and I believe their claim should be granted. But apart from people such as the Yorta Yorta, for most Victorian Aboriginal people there is not a lot of opportunity for the granting of land. So the social justice measures contained within this provision are going to be very important. The Yorta Yorta people of Barmah are one group that has a continuing link to the land. Great amounts of evidence are available to support that claim and I trust that, under this legislation, they will be able to achieve real justice very soon. At this point, I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my remarks in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the best legislation possible under the circumstances. The government has recognised the legitimate rights and concerns of all major interest groups and produced a balanced response.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government realises that this legislation will not deliver anything to those indigenous communities who are unable to establish continuous links with their traditional land due to dispersal and dispossession. A land acquisition fund will be established under legislation to allow such groups to purchase land and thus satisfy their land needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key aspect of this legislative package is the government's intention, as part of its comprehensive response, to formulate the social justice package of measures to address the land, cultural and economic aspirations of indigenous people in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is, of course, of fundamental importance to Victoria's Aboriginal community. A majority of Victorian Kooris are the descendants of past generations of Aboriginal people who were forcibly removed from their traditional lands, systematically dispossessed and thereby deprived of their native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Yorta Yorta Aboriginal community from northern Victoria have an unbroken record of using and protecting the land around the Barmah and Moira forests for traditional cultural and other pursuits. There is ample archaeological evidence of a continuous indigenous presence over many thousands of years. The local Aboriginal community have been claiming a special relationship with the land on either side of the Murray River for over one hundred years. Their's is a reasonable claim which will be facilitated by this act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mining sector has the right to express concerns related to possible impediments to their economic activities. However these concerns have to be put in perspective. Reasonable people with an appreciation of the larger picture agree that you can't measure everything in terms of economic gain for one sector of the community. The diverse claims and expectations have to be recognised and reconciled and the bill before us has the capacity to provide a viable result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A great deal has already been stated about this bill by the opposition. The overreaction to the High Court's response by the conservative forces in this country are based on a minimal number of assertions which, if you scan the records of the Aboriginal struggle for recognition have been trotted out many times in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunate public statements on the matter by the likes of Tim Fischer, Ian McLachlan, Henry Bosch, Richard Court and Hugh Morgan attempt to perpetrate the myth of racial inferiority. They clearly regard the land aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as not worthy of consideration. They see progress in this area as running counter to their own interests and those they purport to represent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been a disturbing lack of substantial statement on Mabo from the opposition. They have attempted to whip up hysteria and mistrust on this process rather than enunciate a position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition have chosen to treat "native title" as a recent invention of the Australian High Court. They have failed to publicly acknowledge that it is a concept which can be traced as far back to the United States Supreme Court in the 1820s and 1830s. The treaties and settlements with the North American Indians and Inuits in Canada was and is based on the settlement of native title. Closer to these shores, in New Zealand the concept of native title as part of the common law was applied in 1847.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition has shown their desire to entrench the convenient view that what happened in the past should be forgotten. The conservative fear campaign has elevated the principle of "potential uncertainty" to new heights of absurdity. There is constant reference to Mabo generating economic confusion and being socially divisive. It is the conservatives themselves that have deliberately spread alarm and fear over this issue. They have consistently misrepresented the consequences of this legislation. In fact, they complain about the consequences of their own actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comments made in this chamber in recent months go to the heart of the coalition's moral malaise. They have reduced key principles in this issue to simplistic terms. They have turned their back on a mature response to a complex issue and applied the ideological blinkers of the new right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Kemp's statements in the adjournment debate on 19 August have illustrated how far he has strayed from the "true liberalism" of his party. He has betrayed a tradition that even Bob Menzies espoused, an understanding that liberalism had to affirm responsibility for the disadvantaged. Senator Kemp has confused "liberalism" with "reactionary conservatism".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Kemp made reference to the "unitary Australia of the federal fathers" and cites the motto&mdash;"one people with one destiny". This seeks to deny the historical truth. In the past the fact is that the Commonwealth ignored the existence of another people. It failed to incorporate the Aborigines as citizens. It allowed that if they had state voting rights, they would have federal voting rights, but otherwise denied them the vote. It provided that Aboriginal people were not to be counted in state populations for the purpose of working out Commonwealth representations. It denied them social welfare benefits. The current Mabo decision recognises long after the event that Aborigines cannot be excluded from full Commonwealth citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Kemp in the same speech also cites Professor Geoffrey Blainey who has been properly accused by Henry Reynolds of Promoting the black armband view of Australian history. Professor Blainey is a nostalgic conservative who refuses to see that Aboriginal dispossession might be righted. He promotes publicly whenever he gets the chance the concept of indigenous Australians being the "enemy within" and perpetrates the notion of "irreconcilable differences" being a justification for no change to race relations in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is telling that, in coming to terms with the Mabo decision, Senator Kemp chose again in the adjournment debate speech to cite a paper given to the Samuel Griffiths Society. Of course it was Samuel Griffith, former Premier of Queensland and Chief Justice of the High Court, who helped formulate the exclusionary and monocultural version of Australian nationhood that Senator Kemp and his side of politics wish to perpetuate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Kemp joined the black armband bandwagon to suggest that the High Court has failed to provide analysis to support the Mabo decision. This denies well documented historical evidence that in the early 19th century the British authorities were concerned that Australian colonists were acting illegally in their expropriating the land of the native peoples. The High Court has belatedly acknowledged this. It has not "indulged in specious reasoning". It has rectified an injustice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we have to accept is that we are not dealing with legislation that delivers perfection. The Native Title Bill 1993 is the culmination of a long process of negotiation and consultation with a wide range of interest groups including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, state and territory governments, mining and pastoral and other industry groups. The outcome is a reasoned and reasonable response. It must be appreciated that this is a complex piece of legislation which responds to a complex situation and has resulted in compromise. The Mabo judgement and the government's response have established the foundation for just future land dealings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now incumbent on states to formally recognise and embrace the principles and practice of indigenous rights under the law and set up a statutory land claims procedure to ensure that native title holders enjoy property rights to the same degree as others.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Developers, pastoralists and miners will have to deal with indigenous people on an equal footing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The referendum of 1967 recognised Aboriginal people as citizens. Following the High Court Mabo decision and this bill, the conservative reactionaries cannot retreat but finally accept that indigenous Australians are part of the constitution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I will quote from the evidence given by Ms George before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in Perth on Friday, 3 December 1993. I might say that Ms George is a woman who has worked for the Aboriginal community in Western Australia and is a woman of Aboriginal descent. At the end of her evidence, she stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the years Aboriginal people, especially the older generation, my mother's generation, have been subjected to the full range of inhumane treatment referred to in the bill as dispossession and the injustices of the past. Those injustices include direct knowledge in their lifetime of massacres, murders, exploitation of labour, dispossession, rape, the exploitation of women and the ripping apart of families. However, the only way in which the marginalisation of Aboriginal people can be turned around, in my opinion, is if we become participants&mdash;not passive, powerless victims becoming increasingly dependent on welfare, and I must say that it pains me to see the state in which most Aboriginal people continue to live in this state, notwithstanding huge injections of government funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Since the founding of this continent in 1788, the history of this country has been largely one of hardship and endurance. In that process, the record of treatment of Australia's indigenous people has not been an enviable one, and I do not shy away from that for one instant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these historical aspects, Australia as a country has achieved much and offers great opportunity for its inhabitants. It is with this in mind that I say that the Mabo decision is one of the most significant decisions made by the High Court since Federation. The coalition has stated that it acknowledges the High Court decision and the relevant definition of native title. The coalition is of the view that the Racial Discrimination Act is of ongoing application and should be followed. The coalition is also of the view that the constitution of this country should be followed without exception. Therefore, it is within that framework that we look at this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government states that this Native Title Bill purports to provide a legislative response to the High Court's decision in Mabo No. 2. In the process of doing this, the government maintains that it has acted to protect the rights of all its citizens. Let us look firstly at the efficacy and constitutionality of this bill. If the bill is to achieve either of the purposes stated by the government, it firstly must be constitutional. This bill is of no use to anyone if it is bad at law. I dismiss entirely any suggestion that I am taking too legalistic a view in starting with this premise. The legislation must also be competent; it must achieve what it sets out to do. The efficacy of any legislation is the primary responsibility of the legislators, and we, being a house of review, bear that responsibility even more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, of which I was a member, concerns were expressed that the Commonwealth could not exercise its powers pursuant to subsection 51(xxvi), being the one dealing with race laws, and 51(xxix), dealing with the external affairs power, to the exclusion of the state's absolute jurisdiction to involve itself in land management. In 1901, when this Federation was formed, the states ceded power to the Commonwealth, but one of the powers they did not cede was that of land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specific powers upon which the Commonwealth exercises its authority can be found in section 51 of the constitution, and so the Commonwealth sets out to rely on those two powers I have mentioned. There was a good deal of concern expressed that it could use those powers to prevail over that exclusive jurisdiction of the states on land management. Furthermore, the Commonwealth would need to justify in clause 11 the retrospective enforcement over the states of an indefinite doctrine of common law. The bill also purports to place an undue financial burden on the states, and I refer to clause 203, which could be seen as infringing the rule in the boilermakers case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have touched briefly on those constitutional concerns. I will leave it there because other speakers will deal with them. However, honourable senators must remember that not one Aboriginal will be helped, not one Australian will be helped, if a bad law is passed. Not one citizen of this country will be helped if the law is incompetent and does not achieve what it sets out to do. I ask honourable senators to remember that. I place those remarks on the record, and history will prove me right. I will not hesitate for one moment to remind this chamber of my comments today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matters dealt with by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs were concerns involving the Aboriginal people of this country. In our dissenting report, appendix 2, some 50 witnesses are listed&mdash;if one includes the witnesses from the Northern Territory who were unfortunately omitted&mdash;who stated that further time was needed for consultation and consideration of this bill. The majority of those witnesses listed in appendix 2 were representatives of Aboriginal communities, and they all asked for more time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns expressed covered a wide spectrum. They ranged from the fact that the Racial Discrimination Act was being overborne by this bill&mdash;and I share that concern&mdash;to the fact that native title was not vested in the Aboriginal native titleholders, as Mabo No. 2 said it should be, but was vested in a prescribed corporate body. That could be done without the consent of the native titleholder. There are no checks and balances in the bill in relation to those prescribed corporate bodies. That was also of concern to some witnesses who appeared before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that hearing I questioned David Ross, from the Central Land Council of the Northern Territory, about whether there had been any improvement in the lot of Aborigines in the Northern Territory as a result of the Aboriginal land rights legislation brought in by the Fraser government in the late 1970s. His answer was that, socially, there had been no improvement. Unfortunately, Aborigines are still drinking themselves to death on the outskirts of townships and communities. I refer to the comments from Ms George which I read at the outset. Huge injections of money will not solve any problem, especially the complex problem associated with the process of reconciliation or native title. We have to have a piece of legislation which accommodates the rights and interests of indigenous people as this country moves into the next millennium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at other aspects of the bill as well. I say unreservedly, and I think the government agrees, that this bill will have more effect on my state of Western Australia than on any other state or territory. Western Australia has the third highest population of Aboriginal people of all states and territories. Some 76 per cent of all pastoral leases are in Western Australia. Some 36 per cent of Western Australia is vacant crown land. The mining industry in Western Australia contributes 15 cent of the total income of this country. So Western Australia, with its mix of farmers, miners, Aborigines and vacant crown land, has the greatest potential under this bill for claims, for conflict, and for litigation to occur under this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing that in mind, we have to look at this vast continent on a state by state or regional basis. Considerations that apply to a factory worker in Dandenong in Victoria cannot be applied to someone who lives in the remote area of the north-west of Australia. I asked David Ross from the Central Land Council whether he was saying that considerations for Aboriginal people in other states might be different from considerations for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. I do not think it would be appropriate. You have got to remember that Aboriginal people here on the east coast and throughout the southern areas of Australia have been colonised for the 206 years that colonisation has taken place. Throughout the north, it has probably been for much less. So you have the differences there in Aboriginal people still being a lot more culture oriented, whereas the people in other areas have been stripped of a lot of that because of the welfare mentality that existed. We all grew up under different rules and regulations and so we have to survive under different ways, and that is just the way things are.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a very perceptive comment from Mr Ross, because the considerations that apply to Aboriginals in the Kimberley and the Pilbara in the north-west corner of this continent are very different from those that apply to Aboriginals living in Redfern, Sydney. At the moment, 16 per cent of Western Australia is subject to a Mabo-style claim, and it appears that there are more claims to follow. So the question of native title in Western Australia is very much a live issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the National Farmers Federation did not take into account the effect this bill would have on pastoral leases in Western Australia in particular. I believe that in Western Australia future acts, as described under this bill, will provide problems for the renewal of pastoral leases. All pastoral leases have to be renewed by the year 2015 in Western Australia. The fishing industry in Western Australia, notably pearling and aquaculture, could face problems of access to their beds and waterways as a result of the artificial definition in the bill of the difference between onshore and offshore areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this move by the Commonwealth, the Western Australian government moved to legislate for Western Australia, and we now have enacted the Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Bill 1993. With regard to comments that have been made in relation to that bill, I refer to Senator Chris Evans's comments that the bill was not ratified or upheld by any independent legal opinion and that there had been a Law Society committee opinion to the effect that it conferred lesser rights and was incompetent law. I point out to the chamber that the three members of that committee, Ian Viner QC, Stephen Churches and Michael Barker, are lawyers who have been involved in the Aboriginal cause. For years Ian Viner has stood by his introduction, when he was a minister, of the Aboriginal land rights legislation in the Northern Territory. Stephen Churches has acted for Aboriginal plaintiffs in the Utemorrah claim, and Michael Barker has already made known his philosophical criticism of the Western Australian legislation. I merely place that on record because, if Senator Chris Evans is to rely on that legal advice as being independent, it is important that this chamber know the details I have just summarised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler mentioned that numerous grants were going ahead in Western Australia as a result of the enactment of the legislation. My inquiries of the Crown Law Department have revealed that in that state the Crown grants are being processed in the number and in the normal manner the department would be using in any other circumstance. In fact, when Mr Morland, from the Department of Land Administration of Western Australia, appeared before the Senate committee, he stated that there were no plans to flood the system with land grants in order to extinguish native title. Whilst I am on the Western Australian legislation, it was Father Frank Brennan who said that he thought that piece of legislation would not be ruled invalid by virtue of the Racial Discrimination Act and that its compensation scheme would, to use his expression, `pass muster'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have traversed a good deal of ground. Before closing, I wish to touch on just one more matter, which is of economic importance. This bill has to be a balance of interests and rights. I do not wish to place any undue emphasis on economic matters at the expense of others. I say this merely to balance the ledger. Fifteen per cent of Australia's total exports come from mining in Western Australia. Mining in Western Australia is not just a parochial concern; it is one that has substantial ramifications for the nation's economy. In fact, the export earnings for the mining industry in Australia in 1992-93 came to a total of $16 billion, or 26 per cent of the total income of this country. That is a feature that cannot be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had figures bandied around today to show that funding for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders is in the region of $1.3 billion to $2 billion. What we have to recognise is that, if the money is not earned, a government cannot bestow adequate services on its citizens. We cannot for one moment deny the economic considerations. Just this week the mining company CRA stated that it is going to increase its overseas exploration by 50 per cent as a result of this bill. As a result of this bill, the mining industry could face delays of up to 18 months for approval of any developments. Any future acts involving mining have to go through a native title determination process, followed by compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I mentioned that this legislation should be competent. To be competent, it has to offer to the citizens of this country a judicial process which is efficient. It is not only the mining industry that is going to suffer by these delays, but also any native title claimants. They could well be tied up in courts and tribunals for that period. In Western Australia last year, 5,702 mining applications were processed. If there are going to be the attendant delays with those applications, we will be looking at a situation of chaos and great expense to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a recommendation by the coalition that this bill be referred for further consideration. That, unfortunately, was defeated. I believe that further consideration could have improved&mdash;in fact, revised entirely&mdash;the operation of this bill, which I see as incompetent and bad at law. I believe that it offers no-one in this country anything and, if implemented, it will only involve the judicial system in chaos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the government has seen fit to put forward 74 amendments, which it says come from the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. When I read the majority report I am afraid I could see only four recommendations. I could not see where the 74 came from. I will tell honourable senators where they came from. They came from recommendations in the minority report. We annexed in appendix 1 some 150 amendments from Aboriginal groups and the mining industry. We put them forward to show the people of Australia just what concerns there were out there with this bill. People who support a headlong rush to pass this bill are short-sighted and will one day rue that enthusiasm. They will rue the fact that in the first instance we did not get it right. </PARA>

I noticed that my colleague Senator Herron qualified his comments on this bill by saying that he had had very little to do with Aboriginal people all of his life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I should say that I have had some involvement with Aboriginals, living very close to an Aboriginal community all my life. My children attended school for 12 years with Aboriginal children. In my younger days I played football both with and against Aboriginals and knew many of them very well. That does not mean that I have any particular knowledge about Aborigines that nobody else has, but at least I have had contact with Aborigines for all of that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to speak on this bill particularly as a concerned Australian, but also with concern for the future of Australians. I may repeat some of the statements that have already been made, both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, but I feel very strongly that this bill should not be passed, and I would like my opposition to this bill to be placed on record. I do not believe that this Native Title Bill is, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) claims, a well-intentioned social justice policy. It is in fact yet another example of the Keating government's arrogant deal making. The bill is arrogant because it will benefit only a very small proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and because at the same time it attempts to take away the states' rights to manage the land within their state boundaries. In his address to the nation on Mabo on 15 November this year the Prime Minister said that the world and future generations will judge Australians on Mabo. </PARA>
<PARA>His argument is that the rejection of this bill will see Australia branded as a racist nation. That may be so in his opinion, but I totally resent and reject the Prime Minister's attempt to stifle debate, publicly in particular, on the principle of native title by implying that supporters of the bill are politically correct and opponents of the bill are racist. To me, political correctness lies in ensuring that we are all treated equally by the law, that is, that all men, all women, all races, all cultures and all religions are treated equally, no-one better than anyone else, and that everyone has the same rights and the same responsibilities and, in my opinion, the same right to own land in the nation we call home, Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that there is a difference between the theory of being treated equally by the law and what actually happens in our society. We do not approve of racism and sexism and lots of other `isms', but they still occur. We all know that sometimes, maybe even often, women are discriminated against in the work force, children are brought up in appalling circumstances and migrants suffer racial discrimination. I am sure that my colleague Senator Panizza, during his lifetime in Australia, could give us many instances where he personally, and many people he knew, suffered discrimination because of their migrant origins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that many Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have suffered terribly at the hands of our ancestors. Many died because of introduced diseases or, in some cases, were killed. They lost their land and, in many cases, had children taken away from them and from their surroundings. But I believe we have to put all this in context. When our ancestors took Aborigines from the land or when, in some cases, Aborigines were put into missions and their children were sometimes taken away and sent to live with white people they honestly thought what they were doing was the right thing. It was not done with malice. Many of those people involved at that time with the taking of children thought they were giving those children a better opportunity. It was done for all the right reasons, not the wrong reasons, although we know now it was not the correct thing to do. It is certainly not something that we would approve of today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing applies to declaring Australia terra nullius&mdash;an empty land. I cannot really imagine that the first white people to arrive in Australia in 1788 really thought that no-one lived here, but at that time it would not have occurred to them, or probably to people of any other nation in the world, to classify the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders as anything but the primitive inhabitants of the land. In those days it was not considered the wrong thing to treat them in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1990s, this view is obviously totally and completely unacceptable. I think it is also wrong to state or imply that the first white Australians should have acted according to what would be acceptable today. Two hundred years ago what they did was acceptable, and it is wrong for us to imply that they should have acted according to what we would call current standards of the 1990s. We cannot rewrite history. I would like to point out to senators that in the year 2193 some of the decisions that we may be taking, maybe even the decision that the government would want us to take today, may also be the cause of much discussion and much criticism and much anguish. There really is no point worrying about how society will judge us in 200 years time because we have no idea how things will have changed by then, just as the first white Australians in 1788 would have had no idea that their actions would be the subject of so much argument in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standing here in 1993, I believe the real issue facing us is the equality of the indigenous Australians in our society. I am not placing any value judgments on that statement. It is not for me or any other white Australian to decide that equality of indigenous Australians means that they should become completely assimilated into our largely Anglo-Saxon society, nor should we perhaps suggest that they should assume a lifestyle as close to their traditional lifestyle as possible. I believe if we had true equality before the law indigenous Australians would have the freedom and the power to choose to follow whichever path they desired, and this is something we should be striving to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know in some small way as a senator I have played a very small part in trying to prevent, in one instance, an Aboriginal hostel&mdash;the Wami Kata Hostel at Port Augusta&mdash;from being closed. I was truly disgusted, not only at the reports of the terrible conditions at this hostel, which would not be considered acceptable in a non-Aboriginal hostel for the elderly, but also that the then Federal Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services could even consider closing Wami Kata Hostel knowing the majority of the residents would have no choice but to go back to their remote communities or live on the streets of Port Augusta. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It saddens me to say that just last year this government, which talks about reconciliation with indigenous Australians, wanted to close an Aboriginal hostel putting people like 103-year-old Beno Murray, who was an Aboriginal veteran of Gallipoli, out onto the streets. It saddens me that, despite all the money that Australian governments, state and federal, have spent in the last 30 years or so, we are really no closer to a healthy or happy indigenous community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this genuine sadness, I do not feel any personal guilt over the actions of white Australians previously, and I am angered that the Prime Minister should suggest that any of this guilt should be placed on me and that, because of this, I should support the Native Title Bill. This bill will do nothing for the residents of Wami Kata, nothing for Aborigines at Point Pearce&mdash;a community near where I live in South Australia&mdash;and nothing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who no longer live on their land. Yes, it will enable some land to be handed back to Aborigines who can demonstrate a connection with the land and, yes, I can see that the concept of native title is, for many Aborigines, attractive. Some would claim that it is a victory for Aborigines. I believe that it will be a hollow victory. There will be a price to be paid, that is, the goodwill of the majority of everyday, ordinary working Australians who, like me, believe that in 1993 all Australians should be treated equally, in every respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that most Australians agree that one of the most fundamental rights we cherish in this democracy is equality before the law. I am also sure that this bill seeks to entrench in the law a fundamental inequality which I believe is un-Australian. I know that it is not considered politically correct to say that this Native Title Bill discriminates against non-Aborigines and non-Torres Strait Islanders but, in truth, that is what it does. This bill says that only indigenous Australians can hold native title so, by virtue of my ancestry, I am excluded. It is true that most non-indigenous Australians are in a far better position to buy a house and land than Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. I do not dispute that. I agree that the actions of many of our ancestors has resulted in indigenous Australians being in a poorer position to buy land than are other Australians. However, I do not believe that the Native Title Bill will overcome this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the lack of land ownership by the majority of indigenous Australians is one of economics and the availability of money. We must turn our minds to the issue of what we can do to change that, so that the majority of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have the same access to income, the same access to an opportunity for jobs, and the same access to loans, so that they too can use this to their benefit. The Native Title Bill creates a separate class of title based on a person's race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of all the good intentions expressed in this chamber, I cannot see how entrenching racial discrimination will remove it from our society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make it clear that I do not oppose the government giving land to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in circumstances where they can show a connection with the land, under the terms that have been laid out; but this can be done without the introduction of a separate title known as native title. Of course, the issues of the preservation of the land and the sacred sites arise, but these are not insoluble.

In fact, I think the government and the supporters of native title are in grave danger of being incredibly hypocritical. On the one hand, the government says that Australia is a multicultural society and that we should encourage people from all over the world to contribute to producing a truly multiracial and multicultural society. On the other hand, we are promoting separatism and distinguishing Australians by virtue of their race. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I ask the minister whether he agrees that growth in small business provides the best opportunity for creating large numbers of real, sustainable jobs. If so, how will adding a new jobs tax to the many new and additional taxes his government has already imposed&mdash;including the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee charge and the increases in wholesale sales tax and fuel taxes&mdash;encourage the investment necessary to create such job opportunities?  Will not this tax just be another burden on the wider tax-paying community and on small business, in particular, and result in fewer real jobs, rather than more?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4663" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly there is no argument but that growth in the economy is overwhelmingly the best means by which jobs can be created. The problem with long-term unemployment&mdash;probably the most crucial social and economic problem we have in this country at the moment&mdash;can be best addressed in that context. Equally, I have no disagreement with the proposition that a good deal of the mechanism by which that growth in the economy at large is likely to be translated into employment is through growth of small and medium businesses and job opportunities within those businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, untroubled as I am by the opening propositions of Senator Hill's question, the suggestion, however, that the government is in some way committed to a jobs levy or a jobs tax and the suggestion, in turn, that if we were to be so committed this would have some wholly negative impact on the small and medium employment sector are both propositions to which I do not accede at this stage. Certainly the government has not made any decision at all about the funding of the kind of job compact that we are talking about, the mechanism by which that would be achieved. That is a matter for decision. One of the things that will have to be taken into account in making that decision is the very question at issue of whether such a tax, if it were to be introduced, would have these sorts of negative impacts or whether, in fact, they are exaggerated. That is very much the kind of issue that will need to be debated, along with a lot of other related policy issues. So it is simply quite premature to be making the sorts of assumptions that underlie Senator Hill's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I take this opportunity to say how much the government welcomes the green paper, the report of the committee on employment opportunities, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restoring full employment</EMPHASIS>. It will be a major contribution to the resolution of the unemployment problem, which is the No. 1 priority issue for the government. The report is the product of a wide-ranging examination by the committee. It canvasses a whole range of options on which the government is and will be seeking comment before we consider our response to it. I add that the committee will undertake an extensive process of consultation and report back to the government on the outcomes of that process at the end of March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will involve meetings throughout the country and feedback will also be received via a toll-free number and written submissions in response to the report. Our intention is then to respond to all of this process in the form of a white paper in May 1994. Until we reach that particular point, until we have completed that process, it really is quite premature to be proceeding on the kinds of assumptions which underlie Senator Hill's question. I conclude by formally tabling the discussion paper, the green paper, and the accompanying summary document.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Has the minister's attention been drawn to the preliminary results from the Russian elections which show strong support for the nationalist leader, Zhirinovsky? What implications does this have for the character of President Yeltsin's government and the prospects for the evolution of democracy in Russia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4664" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing that should be said about the Russian elections is that the consensus among international observers is that they were conducted on a free and fair basis. That was certainly the conclusion of our own parliamentary observers, Senator Loosley and Michael MacKellar, who reported no major irregularities in the area that they were scrutinising or monitoring in Pacific Russia. That experience has been repeated, as I say, throughout the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preliminary figures show a fairly low turnout, with only 53 per cent of registered voters participating. Of these, some 55 per cent did support the draft constitution and Russia now at least has a popularly endorsed constitution, and that is a very important stabilising factor in the period immediately ahead. So far as the parliament itself is concerned, initial and official estimates do suggest very strong support for the nationalist leader, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the rather incongruously named Liberal Democratic Party, which looks like winning on present projections 67 out of the 225 seats that were contested on a party list basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other projections based on initial results are as follows: on the conservative side of the ledger, in addition to the seats won by Zhirinovsky's group with some 25 per cent of the vote, 11 per cent of the vote, or 31 seats, looks like going to the communists, who are properly regarded as conservatives in this context, and eight per cent of the vote, translating to something like 29 seats, to the Agrarian Party. On the pro-reform side of the ledger there is 15 per cent of votes translating to some 38 seats for the pro-Yeltsin bloc led by Minister Gaidar; seven per cent, or 15 seats, for Grigory Yavlinsky's group; 5.7 per cent, or 13 seats, for the Party of Russian Unity and Accord; and 5.5 per cent, or 12 seats, for the Democratic Party of Russia. There is no doubt that this result is a setback for those favouring continued radical economic reform and reflects a strong protest vote against the hardships of the reform process to date and certainly in addition, one should say, the upsurge in crime that has accompanied that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to bear in mind that the figures available on voting for the new parliament are still very incomplete. For a start, they only represent half the lower house seats, namely, those to be elected from party lists. The remaining 225 seats are single member constituencies where over 60 per cent of the candidates in fact stood as independents and where it may be that reformers will fare better than in the party list constituencies. Moreover, no figures at all are available for the 176 seats in the upper house. So the composition of the new parliament will not be known for some weeks, and it may be even longer than that before the kinds of alignments of forces emerge with any clarity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would make is this: under the new Russian constitution, powers are very much concentrated in the hands of the president, rather than the parliament. The selection of the prime minister and cabinet is the prerogative of the president; it does not depend in any direct way on the composition of the legislature. Parliament's role is basically limited to that of passing legislation. It does seem that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin is likely to continue in office, not least because Zhirinovsky has indicated he would not  oppose that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real significance of Zhirinovsky's ascendancy is probably to be seen not just in the difficulties that are likely to be apparent in the legislature versus executive relations in the period immediately ahead; the real problem is what this might presage for the emergence of this character as a credible presidential candidate by virtue of the exposure that he will now have and the status that he will have by virtue of this election which, when combined with the extraordinary powers vested in the presidency as a result of the new constitution, does create a situation which is a cause at the moment of very genuine concern right around the world given Mr Zhirinovsky's track record. Whether he will prove to be any more moderate in practice than he has been as a campaigner in the past remains, of course, again to be seen.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it has to be understood that, since 1984 when Medicare was introduced, there has been a subsidy paid for private patients in public and private hospitals. Obviously, that has escaped the notice of some people in the gallery, some people in the opposition and one or two on my own side, I suspect, as well. That private subsidy is made up of two things: 75 per cent of the medical benefits schedule, which is paid to the doctor who is performing whatever procedure is taking place; and also a reduced hospital charge for private patients in public hospitals.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These indirect subsidies are worth about $1.4 billion this year. All that has happened in respect of my proposals is that the government will look at allowing state governments to get full cost recovery from the funds. Obviously that simply means that if they are to get the money from the funds they will not need it from the Commonwealth. Therefore, the Commonwealth will cash out the subsidy which will go to the funds and, one would have thought, save one further administrative step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the Medicare benefits schedule payments, it is the same thing. Rather than have payments made to patients who then have to run to Medicare offices, funds, doctors' offices and hospitals trying to pay bills, we will simply have that money cashed out. The patient will get one bill in the end, so there will be a saving at least to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to note is that this is a zero sum game; there are no winners or losers in terms of money. The states are well and truly aware of the fact that we will be taking back the windfall gain. They expect it; they support it. There is no argument from them about it. It will have no effect on the number of private patients or private beds in public hospitals, which is running at about 20 per cent of public hospital beds at the moment. That will not be changing and the Medicare agreements, as honourable senators would all be aware, guarantee that public bed days will rise over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as public hospitals are concerned, they will get the same as they do now for their existing private patient numbers. They will just get the money from the insurers rather than from a mixture of insurers and Commonwealth grants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware that the Treasurer said yesterday that ongoing fiscal stimulus was unnecessary. I think he did say that we do not need as much fiscal stimulus in times of improving economic growth as we would otherwise. The important thing is that it is very welcome news that employment is growing faster than the budget estimates.

They still envisage a significant deficit next fiscal year but less than this fiscal year as economic recovery picks up and also because with economic recovery, as Senator Kernot would know, the deficit tends to fix itself because revenue improves and expenditure goes down.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the issue of investment in infrastructure, there has been no explicit decision by the government to reduce infrastructure investment by $1.3 billion. I do not know the origin of the figure but it may well flow from the fact that the One Nation spending will wind down. It may well also flow from the way some investment decisions of future years are presented in the forward estimates. I am not sure whether it is a presentational issue or a matter of substance. There would be a little of both in that figure. I do not know the origin of the figure so I cannot be certain, but I assume that it has to be either one of those two or a combination of the two.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody in Australia can be happy that unemployment is as high as it is or that it is reducing as slowly as it is, but everybody should be pleased that employment is growing as quickly as it is and that all the prospects are that the situation will continue to improve.

In the first 11 months of 1993, deaths on South Australian roads increased by 27.7 per cent, but in the last three months the toll in South Australia has been 152 per cent higher than in the same period last year. Just to give an indication of how real that concern is, I note that 58 deaths have occurred in South Australia, compared with 23 last year. The November statistics, released today, maintain this disappointing national trend, with 165 people dying on the roads, compared with 150 in November 1992. Police and other authorities throughout Australia will be doing their best to ensure that this national tragedy is not continued during December.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure everybody was as pleased as I was to be advised of this very generous initiative by Arthur Boyd and the statement by the Prime Minister about it last night. I think it is worthy of proper recognition. I realise that the delicate sensibilities of some opposition senators are offended by people raising such positive messages around here, but I intend to do it anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arthur Boyd has assigned the copyright on all his works equally to his children and to the nation, and I think that has very profound significance for our cultural development. As most would be aware&mdash;and I know everybody on this side welcomed it&mdash;Arthur and his wife, Yvonne, generously gave `Bundanon', that wonderful property on the Shoalhaven, to the nation to be developed as a living arts centre. In March, the government made a commitment to provide $5.4 million to the Bundanon trust to develop and manage the property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity to visit the property. It is an outstanding property in its own right and a great base for an art centre to be developed in Australia's interest, as it has been the inspiration for that wonderful Shoalhaven series of paintings for which Arthur Boyd is particularly famous. I am sure some of our Victorian colleagues welcome this initiative because so much of this work is on public display in the Victorian Arts Centre. As his art has been an inspiration to Australians, so should his generosity also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain the significance of the gift of copyright in these circumstances. What we are talking about here is a collection of more than 400 works, which contains works by four generations of Boyds, including more than 150 watercolours and pastel works by Arthur Boyd, and paintings by Sir Sidney Nolan, Albert Tucker and Charles Blackman. Income from the reproduction or publication of these works will flow to the Bundanon trust and will be used to continue to develop Bundanon as a living cultural centre for the creation and presentation of art, music, dance and other performance works.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to conceive that over the years the value of what flows from this will be a more significant contribution than the $5.4 million contribution which the Commonwealth has made. It is that sort of partnership between government, artists and individuals through their individual acts of generosity that will over the years enhance the cultural development of the nation, make the best that is provided by Australians available to all Australians and give young Australians with talent the facilities in places like Bundanon to develop that talent and turn it into a career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By any measure Arthur Boyd is an outstanding artist. I think his generosity, with regard to both Bundanon and this contribution to the trust, says he is far more than that. He is an outstanding Australian. On behalf of the government, and I think the whole Senate&mdash;notwithstanding some earlier interjections&mdash;I am sure that everybody would share the view that this is an outstanding act of generosity which we all welcome.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The AIFS, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, plays a very important role in promoting the wellbeing of Australian families. It has established a world reputation as a research institute, and that reputation continues and only grows. The AIFS, it is fair to say, is one of the key sources, if not the only source, of information and research on families in this country. The work it produces is an invaluable resource in assisting both the government and the community in looking at how best to assist families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the work of the AIFS is ongoing research. At the moment it is producing a series of reports contributing to the Australian living standards studies. That reference was given by predecessor minister Brian Howe in this portfolio area. Already two of the reports from that study have come out. I launched one of them about Box Hill not too long ago&mdash;a very interesting series of data about Australian living and what Australians say are important issues for them in terms of where they live and what sorts of factors are important in how they make their decisions about where to live. I refer to things such as transport, access to schools, child care and so on which feature in these considerations, as so also do decisions about the cost of housing&mdash;although interestingly enough, the report shows that the cost of housing is not the highest priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIFS will be playing a very critical role in 1994&mdash;the International Year of the Family. It will be introducing a series of studies for the IYF, including an important study on family values in a multicultural society. It will be developing an important publication for service providers on the rights of children and an important compendium of study and research on work and family issues in Australia, which will tie in very much with the work done by the Department of Industrial Relations and Minister Laurie Brereton on just that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institute is also aware of the importance of making what it does known to the community. It produces a quarterly publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Matters</EMPHASIS>. I suspect many honourable senators have already received copies or looked through that publication. Its intention in 1994 is to make sure that it contributes to community discussion about issues of the family for the year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add to a question that Senator MacGibbon asked yesterday regarding the resignation of pilots. In the period since 1 July 1993 no F111 or FA18 pilots have separated from the air force. In the same period, six FA18 and two F111 pilots have applied for resignation or transfer but are yet to leave the service. The air force is aware of one further FA18 pilot who is considering his resignation. Any RAAF officer may submit an application for resignation or transfer to the reserve, which is considered on its merits. In the case of FA18 and F111 pilots, the air force is naturally concerned to retain their valuable expertise. Hence, if such pilots have not paid back a return of service obligation incurred for basic pilot training, a conversion course or similar training, their applications would normally be rejected. Where pilots do not have a return of service obligation, providing the required notice is given, their applications for resignation are normally accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are provisions under air force regulations for applications to be rejected in certain circumstances, such as in time of war and defence emergency, but these do not apply at this time. Pilots resign from various units throughout the year but the training system is designed to provide graduates to replace losses through separation or posting. Additionally, where necessary, experienced pilots may be posted back to flying units from non-flying positions to boost experience levels. While there has been a recent increase in applications for separation from FA18 pilots, providing no further separations occur before mid-1994, graduates from present training courses will replace these losses. Similarly, the two F111 pilots will be replaced through training and posting action.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), to a question without notice asked by Senator Patterson this day, relating to mental health and the Burdekin Report.</PARA>
<PARA>The question posed by Senator Patterson today was very important and went to the heart of the recent Burdekin report into mental illness. It is obvious that there is a major difference of opinion between the senior portfolio ministers. Senator Richardson today mumbled and fumbled, walked away and implied that somehow the government was going to get back into the budget process next year and look at this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, said in the House of Representatives yesterday. At question time he clearly indicated that this process of considering the Burdekin report into mental illness would not be responded to overall for a period of, I think, 12 months. That is shameful. I think that certainly would heighten the concerns that Senator Patterson rightly brought to us this afternoon in her question about the effects on many Australians, both old and young, with mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe, of course, is seeking to protract, delay and get out of the budget process. He wants to introduce this into another debate and transfer it to next year. Of course, he will say that he will want to have the time to consult with the states and territories. They will be the scapegoats. If Mr Howe cannot get on with the job simply by calling Commissioner Burdekin into his office for a chat about the report and identifying some of the principal and major issues that were raised in the Burdekin report, he has a serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that Mr Howe yesterday referred to complex solutions and a change in culture&mdash;a bit like the culture change that obviously Senator Richardson is seeking to impose in the health portfolio. What culture change is so necessary in the area of mental illness or mental health? The fact is that Mr Howe yesterday went in to bat by saying that it would not be in next year's budget process; that it would be towards the end of the year before we start to get any consideration. And then today he came out with a press release which talked about surveys and studies of attitudes in employment for people with mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely there is an absolute dichotomy here between what the minister says one day and his then seeking to pass the buck by conducting more surveys, et cetera. This is the way in which this government approaches culture change that it wants to achieve. It carries out more assessments, reviews and inquiries, and then conducts surveys to convince people about what it wants. It is a matter that the minister must address with priority. My concern today is that Senator Richardson and Mr Howe obviously are not talking about the same issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the coalition task force on mental health met and had comprehensive and satisfactory discussions with Commissioner Burdekin a week ago. I would share Commissioner Burdekin's concerns that budget priorities should be flowing in the first part of next year. I am a bit suspicious about this 12-month deferral, because Commissioner Burdekin's own appointment currently has only been renewed on a limited tenure for another 12 months. Is this matter designed to keep the monkey off the government's back? Commissioner Burdekin has identified a lot of issues that need thorough and proper consideration. Mr Howe, by now pushing it out for another 12 months, is obviously trying to keep Commissioner Burdekin at bay&mdash;and I find that intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that needs major consideration. I certainly know that Dr Hewson and members of our coalition task force have given this matter priority. We certainly accept that initiatives must be taken to ensure that the response is positive and that inroads are made to the problems faced by people with mental illness, their families and carers. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will do that in a way which will allow us to consult relevant ministers at state level in March or April next year and to respond to the Burdekin report overall in 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not good enough. Where there is a will there is a way. It is obvious from the Deputy Prime Minister's response that there is not a will and the government cannot find a way. At least Senator Richardson had the judgment to suggest that if the government could not do it by May, it should try to do it earlier. I was pressing him on whether it should be before the 1995 budget and he seemed to indicate that a possibility would be to have some sort of additional estimates to look at that. I call on the government to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I go into nursing homes and hostels, which I do over and over again, I see that the lack of flexibility in nursing home and hostel funding is a major issue, especially with regard to people who have dementia. For example, when I was in a country town in eastern Victoria there was a gentleman with a wife who was only in her early 50s with full blown Alzheimer's disease&mdash;the early onset of dementia. He had been locking her up at home so he could continue to go to work. Obviously, that was not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no way that he could get assistance until a local hostel, because it received some bequests, had some money and was able to take this man's wife during the day and for two evenings a week to enable him to meet with some of his friends in the evening and maintain some semblance of social life. In that way he was able to look after his wife and, at the same time, maintain his employment and have status in the community in the sense that he was caring for his wife at home with assistance. There is no funding for that&mdash;it is so inflexible that he was unable to get any&mdash;yet if he had stayed at home, he would have got a carer's pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see case after case&mdash;and that could be any one of us caring for people in their early 50s with full blown Alzheimer's disease. Another friend who was in a youth organisation with me when I was young has a husband who is 51 with full blown Alzheimer's disease. She leaves him at home for three days a week on his own and for one day a week leaves him in a facility for young people with brain damage. That is the way we are dealing with things&mdash;people are making do. These people have been put at the bottom of the pile, and the government has put them at the bottom of the pile yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on Mr Howe to go and talk to some of those people, especially those who are caring for people with dementia at home. All these people were highlighted in the Burdekin report. Obviously, as the shadow minister for aged care, I have taken particular interest in that area. When one goes out to special facilities for people with dementia, one finds that they are threatened with closure because there is no funding for people with dementia in that sense in the aged care sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see those people and their carers being deprived and having to wait longer than they should have to wait&mdash;and longer than I think Senator Richardson thinks they have to wait. I call on Senator Richardson to put pressure on Mr Howe for this government to respond to the Burdekin report and respond to the very real needs that exist in our community for both young and older people with problems associated with mental illness, and do it by the May budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wanted this budget early and it should not now use the excuse that because the budget is early it cannot do things. The government cannot have it both ways. Either it brings on the budget and speeds up the process, or it leaves the budget until later, addresses all the issues and brings the budget back in due course when it has been planned. Obviously the government has not planned for this and the excuse will now be, `Because the budget is early, we can't deal with it'. I call on the government to deal with it because those carers out there&mdash;thousands of them throughout Australia&mdash;demand action and demand a response to the Burdekin report sooner than Mr Howe would give us one. </PARA>

<PARA>The Senate will recall the question was: on how many occasions has the Minister for Resources&mdash;either this minister or the previous minister&mdash;actually taken advice and acted on advice from the Australian Heritage Commission with respect to the protection of old-growth forests with high conservation value? Honourable senators will recall that Senator Richardson's reply was that he refused to table either the advice or details of the action which the minister has taken. The reason for that, quite simply, is that in the last three years neither this minister nor the previous minister has ever acted on advice from the Australian Heritage Commission. As a consequence, one has seen the destruction of old-growth forests being driven very much by exploitation at any cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The factors which the Australian Heritage Commission, and indeed the conservation organisations and the departments in the various states, are feeding in in relation to the damage which is going on, the threatened species which are disappearing, the habitats which are being destroyed, are carrying no weight whatsoever in the decisions in relation to the renewal of woodchip licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was asking my question, there were interjections also from Senator Boswell, who said, `There the Democrats go again&mdash;only concerned about the forests, not concerned about jobs'. The Senate will also recall that this morning I gave notice of a motion stating that Manildra, a company operating out of Nowra, as a direct consequence of the bounty scheme which the Democrats negotiated with the government in the last budget, has now committed itself to a $37 million investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This relates very much to the forest because what we are primarily concerned about is not just development at any cost but development which is sustainable, development which does not destroy the job opportunities for the next generation by destroying the very environment on which those jobs are going to be based&mdash;development which in fact produces jobs now and at the same time protects the environment on which future jobs will be based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a direct consequence of that $37 million investment, Manildra, which is currently making 1.825 million litres&mdash;these figures are significant&mdash;of ethanol a year, will make 33.3 million litres in the next financial year, 44 million litres in the following year and 60 million litres in the year after that. This is a fuel which will substantially replace petroleum for transport. It is a fuel which is totally renewable. It is a fuel which is produced in regional centres. It provides the sort of employment which should not be provided by tearing down old-growth forests and sending away low-value woodchips and provides a solution to many of the environmental problems which the present consumption of petroleum is causing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also launches us on a massive attack on our balance of trade problems. Last year we imported $4 billion worth of petroleum. The bureau of resources and the Australian Institute of Petroleum both say that we have seven years supply of petroleum left in this country and that by the year 2000 we will be importing over $9 billion worth of petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of alternative sources of energy in this country, particularly for transport, is absolutely crucial if we are going to bring together a solution to those three problems: an attack on our balance of trade, a move towards sustainability, and producing the sorts of industries which will provide employment in the long term. So, quite contrary to Senator Boswell's interjection, the Australian Democrats are very concerned about job creation, but job creation which is sustainable and which is not at the expense of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I enjoin Minister Lee to take on board the advice which he gets from the Australian Heritage Commission, which is coming from state departments of conservation and land management and other departments around Australia, to recognise that there are very few jobs in the forests and that those jobs are temporary because other countries have done what we have not done.

The second tier of his program is to get the insurance organisations to go with the private hospitals and then negotiate capping fees for doctors who treat patients within those private hospitals. That just will not work. It has been tried in the US with preferred provider organisations and it just did not work. Those organisations, those hospitals, do not want to admit patients that are going to go over the diagnosis related groupings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson does not even understand diagnosis related groupings. He said to Paul Lyneham last night, `It's far too complicated. I can't spend the time trying to explain it to you because it is too complicated'. In politics, if somebody cannot explain it within one sentence, he does not understand it himself. He gave a classic example of that last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the minister's benefit, I will explain to him what diagnosis related groupings are. When somebody is admitted to hospital, the hospital has a fixed sum with which to treat that patient for that disease. It is as simple as that. He could have said that in one sentence last night. But he did not understand himself, so we cannot blame him for not being able to explain it to Paul Lyneham. That system will not work. It has not worked in the United States; it has not worked anywhere in the world. Private hospitals do not want to treat patients that are going to cause them to exceed the fixed sum allowed for that disease process. As somebody said, it gets the patients through faster and sicker, and they are put back into the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister is doing is trying to treat a haemorrhage with a bandaid when it needs radical surgery. He knows that. This little bandaid that he is putting on in relation to this so-called reform is no reform; it is tinkering at the edges. Senator Richardson knows the problem, and we know the answer&mdash;and that is to encourage low and middle income earners to take out private insurance. Then we will get Medicare working in conjunction with the private health system, as it was 15 or 20 years ago, when about half the patients were treated in public hospitals and half were treated in private hospital. People should be encouraged to take out private insurance so as to correct the imbalance. </PARA>

<PARA>This report was tabled subsequent to the remarks I made this morning on the native title legislation wherein I mentioned the Wami Kata hostel in Port Augusta. In relation to region seven&mdash;South Australia&mdash;the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The past 12 months has seen a continued effort to provide residents with an improved standard of service.</PARA>
<PARA>It later states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A highlight of the year was the featuring of one of our hostels on what is arguably the largest outdoor mural to be painted in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that the highlight of the year was some nine months ago when we were able to keep Wami Kata hostel in Port Augusta open as a facility for aged care for Aboriginals. In this year of the indigenous people when this government says that it is doing all it can to make things better for Aboriginals, particularly those who are disadvantaged, the funding for Wami Kata&mdash;a 24-bed Aboriginal hostel which is run by the Umewarra Mission Inc.&mdash;was being completely cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only after some considerable pressure was placed upon the department&mdash;particularly through the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), and particularly through my office&mdash;that we were able to make sure that the Wami Kata hostel stayed open. Honourable senators may remember that one of the residents of that hostel who was 103 years of age, an Aboriginal by the name of Beno Murray, a Gallipoli veteran, looked like being forced on to the streets because of a lack of funding for this hostel. There was no other place for him to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal people who find it the most difficult and the people who require the most attention are the older Aborigines who require aged care. The government relented on this issue only after considerable pressure was placed on it from the residents, from the hostel and, particularly, through the work that was done from my office. We were able to make sure that funding was made available. I am surprised that no mention is made in the report of Aboriginal Hostels Ltd of the problems which were encountered by Wami Kata prior to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that it was probably a good thing that an election was pending because I am sure that that made it possible to place more pressure on the government to make sure that the Wami Kata Aboriginal hostel was kept open, and that the needs of these disadvantaged people who can no longer look after themselves were met. The aged people in the Aboriginal community were certainly looked after and treated in the manner in which they deserve to be treated. </PARA>

<PARA>Unfortunately, I have not had an opportunity to read this report in detail. It is a shame that these reports are rushed through towards the end of the year and we are not given sufficient time to look at them and digest them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry is one of the best in Australia, one of the greatest export earners for our country, and one suffering this recession that the Labor Party organised for Australia. In spite of that, it has continued to grow. Whilst the tourism industry is buoyant throughout Australia, I am always very pleased and proud to note the growth of tourism in Queensland generally and in North Queensland in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Far North Queensland region continues to leap ahead in tourism activities. International airlines announce new flights into Cairns every couple of months. Tourist destinations in Far North Queensland range through the Cape York area, the Daintree wilderness, the wet tropics, the Barrier Reef and many man-made facilities that have been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt the ATC does its part in promoting Australian tourism overseas. I have been concerned about some of the appointments to various federal government boards in the past. It seems to me that, although my state of Queensland is one of the principal areas of tourism in Australia, its representation on the various federal government bodies that are set up to promote the tourism industry is very much lacking. I raised this in the estimates committee. It seems that a lot of the appointments are made from areas close to the current minister's base. One wonders why those parts of the tourism industry which contribute so much are not involved in the higher echelons. Senator Burns, from Queensland, would share my concern at the dearth of Queenslanders in these important areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have not had an opportunity to read this report in detail, a quick glance at it suggests that the tourism industry's enormous concern about the Labor Party's proposal to tax the industry yet again with a fringe benefits tax on business travel and conventions has not been mentioned. This proposal by the Labor Party was successfully diverted from the budget legislation, but it is still around because the matter has gone back to Treasury and, hopefully, the tourist department, for them to look at it again and a green or white paper is supposed to be coming out in relation to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax was proposed by the Labor Party with no understanding whatsoever of small business or our tourism industry. The government is desperate to get money from anywhere. Because the tourism industry was one of the few industries that had continued to grow, it looked like a fair target, so the Labor Party has hopped into it as usual. The tourism industry is made up mainly of small business enterprises. So the Labor Party is again taxing small businesses&mdash;usually family companies and partnerships, which are the mainstay of tourism&mdash;to grab a bit more money out of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That tax is still around. It is one that I know the tourism industry is very concerned about. Somewhere along the line there is the thought that whenever the government needs a bit of money&mdash;which this government always does to fund some of its more outrageous projects&mdash;it looks at the tourism industry and grabs a bit of money off it. That cannot go on forever. The Labor Party has to put aside its greed and envy and realise that small business in the tourism area has to be supported and not taxed out of existence. The sooner that message gets through to the Labor Party, the sooner the tourism industry can continue to expand with confidence and reach a potential the surface of which has only just been scratched. </PARA>

<PARA>I will not delay the Senate for too long on this matter because I know we are all so keen to get back to the Native Title Bill and have it passed. The obvious line to start any address to the Auditor-General's report No. 22 of 1993-94, which deals with the cash management of Commonwealth government departments, would be: another day, another Auditor-General's report and another wastage of millions and millions of dollars by this Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that we considered yesterday, which dealt with the Commonwealth government's corporate card, identified millions and millions of dollars wasted in unnecessary transaction costs within the Australian government. After I had addressed yesterday's report, I found out that the Commonwealth government is now using its corporate card&mdash;or the Commonwealth credit card, as it has become known over the past couple of days&mdash;to pay itself. One Commonwealth government agency is using the corporate card to pay bills owing to another Commonwealth government agency. Last year one agency&mdash;I think it was Telecom&mdash;incurred costs of $823,000 just in unnecessary transaction fees by using credit cards to pay itself. It is quite phenomenal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, most of us know that Commonwealth public servants and many people employed by the Commonwealth have access to fuel cards. That is the way that the Commonwealth ensures that, because of its massive purchases of fuel, it receives significant benefits from bulk purchasing agreements and also from exemption from excises. Yesterday's report, which deals with the management of the Commonwealth's cash and how the Commonwealth pays for things, found that the corporate credit cards&mdash;not the fuel cards&mdash;are also being used to purchase fuel and are costing the Commonwealth taxpayer roughly $800,000 a year. That was the amount incurred just from the small sample of departments that the Auditor-General looked at. An amount of $800,000 a year is being wasted because the Commonwealth is not getting the benefit of agreements, such as bulk purchasing, that have been negotiated. So yesterday I found that a few more millions dollars are being wasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report the Auditor-General refers to the Commonwealth adopting more sensible cash management policies in the way that it deals with cash moving around the Commonwealth and going out to its suppliers, payment of wages and all of the other enormous flows of cash that we could only be horrified at which are moving around this amorphous mass of Commonwealth government. On the first page of the report, the Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arising from the audit findings to date, a number of issues have emerged which have common application across a range of departments and which have the propensity to save many millions of dollars of the Commonwealth's net cost of borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA>All of us know that the Commonwealth has enormous borrowings, that we owe enormous debts to international banks and other financiers and that we have an enormous deficit problem in this country. As I said, here we have another day and another Auditor-General's report showing that inefficiency in handling money by this Commonwealth government is costing taxpayers millions of dollars that do not need to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just reinforces the view that many taxpayers have reached, particularly since the March election&mdash;and it is a shame that they did not come to that realisation before the March election&mdash;that this Labor government cannot be trusted with people's money. It could not be trusted to run a local corner grocery store; it would mess that up. But in running this enormous business called the Commonwealth government of Australia it wastes millions and millions of dollars every day. I remind honourable senators on both sides and anyone who is listening the Senate today, including those people in the gallery who look fascinated by this, that all of these dollars are extracted from the back pockets of Australian taxpayers who are already struggling under higher taxes. They are about to be hit by jobs levies, Mabo levies, Medicare levies and every other levy that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and his ministers can think of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has identified once more inefficiency, mismanagement of cash handling and money within the Australian Labor government. The opposition calls on the government not to keep passing the buck and saying that it is someone else's fault. Let us find a minister&mdash;be it the Minister for Finance or the Treasurer or the Minister for Administrative Services&mdash;who will take responsibility for some of these issues and say, `We have the evidence. We know how to fix it. Let us get financial management in the Commonwealth back on track. Let us make it accountable. Let us make sure it can be scrutinised properly. Let us try to  save the poor old over-burdened Australian taxpayer some money and ensure that what taxes are raised are spent on areas of need&mdash;those tens of thousands of Australians who are living in poverty, the Aboriginals and other people who are suffering under this government. Let us make sure that when we do raise taxes, the money goes to those people in need and not to organisations like Westpac in transaction fees that are totally unnecessary'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report relates to the protection of confidential client information from unauthorised disclosure. On 16 April 1991, I gave notice that the following matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs:  The question of whether there are effective legal and administrative deterrents to prevent the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of information, as discussed on pages 14 to 16 of the Privacy Commissioner's 1989-90 Annual Report.</PARA>
<PARA>This inquiry was conducted by that Senate committee. In its report to the Senate, the committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the government provide as a matter of urgency its response as to action it has taken, is taking or intends to take in relation to the matters raised in the report, in particular: sanctions against public servants who disclose personal information held by a government agency without authorisation; the criminal law as it applies to those who procure the unauthorised disclosure of personal information held by a government agency; and the coverage of the Privacy Act in relation to the Privacy Commissioner's power (a) to investigate the unauthorised procurement and disclosure of personal information held by a government agency; and (b) to award damages to those who have been harmed by the unauthorised disclosure of personal information held by a government agency.</PARA>
<PARA>I bring these recommendations to the Senate's attention because they demonstrate that the issue of the `protection of confidential client information from unauthorised disclosure', which is the subject of this audit report, has been in the public arena for a considerable length of time. In fact, this issue goes back even further. One of the first tasks of the New South Wales ICAC, or Independent Commission Against Corruption, was to examine the unauthorised disclosure of government information. In each of his first three annual reports to the parliament, the Privacy Commissioner referred specifically to this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, upon the release of the report of the ICAC inquiry, this issue has been the subject of a committee of inquiry in the House of Representatives. This audit report relates specifically to the Department of Social Security, and this is pertinent because social security holds personal details about vast numbers of Australians. Social security was also mentioned by ICAC as a source of personal information which had been disclosed to third parties on an unauthorised basis for financial gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this background, what has the auditor concluded about the protective mechanisms that social security has in place to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of personal information?  In summary, the auditor has concluded that social security does have a commitment to the protection of confidential client information. I would be horrified if it did not, given the amount of information that it holds. However, the auditor has found that there are significant vulnerabilities in DSS's protection procedures. Obviously, policy formulation in the area of information protection involves striking an appropriate balance between managing the risks of unauthorised disclosure and measuring the financial and other costs of such procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is apparent from this report that the auditor does not believe that DSS has struck the appropriate balance. The auditor has highlighted two areas in which DSS's current procedures are deficient. First, the auditor is concerned about the number of officers who have access to confidential information. In the introductory note, the Auditor-General refers to the fact that part-time staff members who have not necessarily had security checks are included in this group, which I find fairly amazing. I am sure that most Australians who have anything to do with social security would also find it fairly amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the auditor is concerned that DSS does not have any effective audit trails which can be used to track the use of personal information by departmental officers. Despite the widespread attention this issue has attracted in recent times, the auditor found that DSS has not conducted a cost-benefit analysis or evaluation of its procedures since 1985. Again, I find that fairly amazing, given the enormous pressure involved and the interest that has been taken by both senators and House of Representatives members in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disturbingly, the auditor has also noted a degree of confusion in DSS about who has responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality of client information. There should be no confusion; it should be very clear both to the senior officers and to the junior officers, some of whom may wish to bring some concern to the attention of the relevant person. They should know exactly who is responsible for the protection and control of the very personal information that is kept in the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auditor has concluded that DSS's information technology systems do provide some protection against the unauthorised disclosure of personal information, but they do not provide maximum protection, and there is significant room for improvement. For example, currently virtually all DSS officers have access to the personal details of DSS clients throughout Australia. Obviously, there are valid reasons for making this information universally accessible within the department. However, it must be debatable whether every DSS officers requires this amount of information to carry out his or her daily duties. I presume it would be possible to restrict accessibility of the details of interstate clients and clients from other social security areas and have some mechanism when somebody wants to get from one state to another into that database. Why is it not possible to introduce a two-tiered system of inquiries?  Surely this could be done without jeopardising the services provided to clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auditor has also identified a distinct lack of audit trails of personal information accessed by departmental officers. It was found that such trails are virtually non-existent unless a specific allegation has been made. It is a case of shutting the door after the horse has bolted. It was also found that the printing facilities attached to personal computers are not subject to an audit trail. I raised concern about the very issue of personal computers and the amount of data they would hold when officers went out into the field with these personal computers. I remember asking&mdash;it was in estimates or somewhere&mdash;what sorts of safeguards were in place as a result of these personal computers being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also found that printing facilities attached to personal computers are not subject to an audit trail. This allows officers unquestioned access to information both on their screens and in printed form. More disturbingly, the auditor found that no audit trails apply to the hundreds of DSS application programmers who, if they were so inclined, would be able to download data onto computer discs. Nobody need question the commercial value of large databases of information regarding people on social security who may not be in a position to afford a certain item and who could be integrated into another mailing list.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I had almost completed my remarks prior to question time, I would make only one or two more brief comments. Just before question time being called on, I was making quite clear that I personally had no opposition to the government giving land to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in circumstances where they can show a connection with the land under the terms laid out by the High Court.

I recall that, during my speech on marine native title during debate on the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, I made comment about some matters.

When compared to the national average, the unemployment rate for Aboriginal people is six times higher; their average income is significantly lower; their life expectancy is 20 years less; and their child mortality is three times higher than the national average.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is undoubtedly the most damaging and divisive ever introduced into this place because it goes to the heart of Australian culture. If the intention of the federal government in this bill was to unite black and white Australia, it has failed.

If it was to establish in concrete rights of ownership of land, it has merely served to make land title more complex and legally muddled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has the potential to unleash a racial backlash the like of which we have never witnessed in this country. It will unleash a run of legal challenges for which, ultimately, the taxpayer will be charged.

This federal Labor government, this Keating government, will undoubtedly be written up in the history books as the most misguided and mischievous of any government since federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Green senators are seeking to become legends in their own lunchtimes, they will probably succeed with their support for this bill. However, I suggest that all famous lunchtime legends are forgotten by afternoon tea, and so it will be with the current brace. The Native Title Bill itself is some 155 pages; the explanatory memorandum, in two parts, is no shorter; so to suggest that the government has made every effort to produce a concise and clear document is patently wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is to be commended for its efforts to canvass genuinely the views of a cross-section of Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of these meetings demonstrates the anger, frustration and concern about this legislation.

<PARA>I wonder whether the government consulted many people at all. This same man claimed that the whole consultative process and the $1.4 million given to ATSIC was concentrated on the central Australian Land Council. He claimed that New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland got nothing and were not consulted. His views are shared by the Chairman of the Birri Gubba Land Council and, indeed, all the Birri Gubba people who are traditional owners of an area bounded by Townsville, Charters Towers, Clermont and Marlboro. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Paul Coe from the Wiradjuri Nation expressed similar views, particularly about the unseemly rush. He called the legislation a `hall of mirrors', `an illusion'. The New South Wales Legal Service says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our request to you is that you may consider deferring the present legislation until the Aboriginal issues are placed, and all Aboriginal people are accorded the internationally recognised right to self-determination and consequently the right to free and informed consent. Since the Native Title Bill makes reference to international conventions and minimum standards on human rights&mdash;those standards have to be applied.</PARA>
<PARA>That is coming from the other side of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Michael Back, the executive director of the Northern Territory Cattleman's Association, expressed concern that what could and should have been legislation accessible to all Australians is instead a non-lawyer's nightmare. Everywhere the committee went it spoke with people who felt that they should have been consulted but had not been. I am quite sure Senator O'Chee would agree with that. The committee spoke to representatives from industry groups and companies, individuals&mdash;young and old, black and white. That is hardly a sound basis for reconciliation and hardly a basis from which Australia should launch itself into the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of objections being raised by the coalition and I will deal briefly with a few of them. The questions of states rights is germane to the whole philosophy of the bill. Other honourable senators have spoken at length about this. As Senator Ian Macdonald said earlier in this debate, states rights are the same as people's rights. Mr Sam Hulme, QC, as legal counsel for Western Australia, asserted to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practical result is to wholly subordinate state land administration to Commonwealth control, and in Western Australia, of course, that is more than half the land of Western Australia. We list there the kinds of matters which arise, such as fishing, tourism, social welfare, water supply, mining and commerce of all kinds. These will all come under Commonwealth control. We say there is very little left of the state function in that enormous area and that the implications of that are particularly a matter for inquiry by the Senate committee, this Senate which was established as a states house.</PARA>
<PARA>His colleague, also legal counsel for the Western Australian state government, expressed similar views claiming the legislation was flawed and that given more time we would find some more flaws; it is not only flawed but also complex. For example, in evidence Mr Michael Eggleston, the executive director of the Department of Mines in Western Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand the bill you have to understand the definitions.</PARA>

A permissible future act can be impermissible in certain circumstances, and an impermissible future act can be permissible also in certain circumstances. I put it to you that it is extraordinarily confusing&mdash;almost incomprehensible&mdash;to the user.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . how can land administrators, miners, farmers, fishermen, pearlers, tourist operators and the Aboriginal community hope to even begin to make this work?</PARA>
<PARA>For rural Australians, the legislation is a potential legal nightmare. Where do farmers with pastoral leases stand? The noted legal firm, Blake Dawson Waldron, in an opinion it gave to the Mining Industry Council on co-existence of native title with pastoral leases, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are arguments extant that the grant of many leases, including pastoral leases, will not have extinguished Native Title, and that those leases and Native Title can co-exist.</PARA>
<PARA>The firm went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is nothing in the NTB which would prevent such claims being made, nor to prevent the registration of a claim for determination of Native Title to areas covered by pastoral leases. The Registrar may refuse to register the claim, but he is not obliged to so refuse. If claims of co-existence succeed, the following will transpire:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Real problems will occur if any of the arguments suggesting that Native Title co-exists with existing valid leases are ultimately accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the mining industry is already gearing up to move offshore, as the coalition has said it would be forced to do. An article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> written by Daniel Moss stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CRA Ltd will increase its overseas mineral exploration spending by more than 50 per cent to escape the full impact of the Government's native title legislation, the group's managing director, Mr John Ralph, said yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA>Here we are, a country with all the resources, with all the things that could make our country bigger and greater, forcing our industries offshore with this legislation. So this federal Labor government, not content with wrecking the economy with high interest rates which stayed for so long and soaring inflation which knocked so many people around in the late 1980s, is now about to put in place legislation that will drive our mining industry offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard similar comments from numerous sources in Europe earlier this year. People will not invest in Australia given that we have legislation that is a legal nightmare, open to challenge at every turn and likely to create economic and social mayhem. The coalition wants a just and workable solution to the issues of native title, but it must include validation of past grants of land titles; there can be no relaxation of the Racial Discrimination Act; and compensation must be non-discriminatory and available to be sought on equal terms by all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that this legislation ought to sit on the table to allow more discussion, more debate and more understanding. It is imperative that we get it right. But the timetable and tactics of the Labor Party and others in this place&mdash;such as Senator Chamarette on my left&mdash;guarantee that the bill will not be debated calmly and considered deeply. In the end, the outcome will depend on the last deal made by the Democrats or the Green senators in this place. This is no way to run a country but it is an excellent way to ruin one, and that is what this bill will do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words on the Native Title Bill 1993. Like my colleagues&mdash;those on this side of the house anyway&mdash;I have received numerous representations from different groups and different people in my state of Tasmania. They have genuine concerns about this bill and they have genuine concerns about the lack of community consultation which has occurred. I therefore take this opportunity to place some of my concerns on record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill 1993 has served to divide Australians rather than unite them. It is not the blueprint for reconciliation which our community needs, nor is it the blueprint which Aboriginal people deserve. As has been said by just about everybody who has spoken in this place, this bill is being rushed through at the end of the year. It is being rushed through so that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can achieve his own political objectives. As such, this bill is sadly lacking. If we ever needed any evidence that this bill is being rushed through, I remind the Senate that only this morning some 70 amendments to this bill turned up. That just proves the point that the legislation has not been well thought out. No doubt, more and more amendments will come forward as time goes by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position, as has been stated, was to refer this bill to a Senate committee. We believe that that would have allowed the opportunity for all Australians to have more input. But because of the deals which are done in this place, that opportunity has been lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really cannot understand why we need to have this great rush. At worst, a Senate committee would report back to this parliament in three months. What problem is there with another three months when Europeans have been settled in Australia for some 200 years? Why do we suddenly have to rush in and try to justify the High Court decision and put that decision into some sort of order? A lot of evidence could have been given to us, as happens in the case of a lot of other bills we consider. There is no problem with referring those bills to committees. But in this case, because the Prime Minister, for his own political reasons, wants to rush this legislation through, proper process has not been followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill should be about cooperation and consultation. Instead, the government has driven a divisive wedge between the Commonwealth and the states and territories, and between non-Aboriginals and the Aboriginal community. Even within the Aboriginal community itself there are varying views that have not been heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter where one goes, one will find that the failure to consult with the community will only make this bill more divisive. In fact, only yesterday I asked a question to which Senator Collins has been trying to get an answer. Today he came into the Senate and said, `Look, as far as I am aware, we have not had any communications from the government of Norfolk Island'. I have now furnished him with a letter which clearly shows that the Norfolk Island government wrote to Warren Snowdon, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, on 22 November making known its concerns about the lack of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that as Norfolk is part of Australia, the government of Norfolk Island would have been consulted. But, from what I can understand, there has been no consultation whatsoever. The Norfolk Island government is very concerned because it is of the view that terra nullius does not have any relevance to the island and therefore it wonders why it should be roped in by this legislation. That seems to be the general consensus of the government there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, only a few moments ago I was speaking by phone to a representative of the Norfolk Island government because I wanted to make sure that what I had accused the federal government of was correct. And it is correct. The federal government had not consulted with Norfolk Island in any shape or form. Tomorrow I will be interested to see what answer I get from the minister's department as to why consultation did not occur. After all is said and done, the department has a Mabo unit for that very reason. Here again, because of the rushed passage of this bill, a very important part of Australia has been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the Senate have always supported the principle that all Australians, regardless of their race or creed, should be treated equally. We initially endorsed the government's consultative process in relation to the Mabo decision, but in June 1993 at the heads of government meeting in Sydney it was made very clear by the Prime Minister that as the state and territory leaders would not accept his legal response to land management issues, that response was going to be forced upon them. That is what we are doing right here and now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June of this year, the coalition's Mabo subcommittee released its detailed discussion paper on the Mabo issue. In that paper we outlined our views that all Australians should be treated equally under the law, that title should be validated immediately, that native title is law, that jobs and development should not be jeopardised and that mineral rights should be protected. I think Senator Brownhill covered those concerns very adequately in his presentation just a while ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We further endorsed the viewpoint that, whilst reconciliation was an issue which should be resolved, it was important that the Mabo issue and reconciliation should be dealt with as separate matters. But for some reason or other, the Prime Minister has tried to muddy the waters by putting them together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's legislation was fundamentally flawed from the outset in that it claims that the purpose of the bill is to ensure the recognition and protection of native title. Anybody with a basic understanding of the law would appreciate that native title is already recognised by our legal system and is already protected by federal law. Native title was recognised in the High Court decision of June 1992. We know that the plaintiffs obtained a declaration of their native title and this means that the bill is an unnecessary duplication of a position which has already been ratified by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many reasons why this parliament should be more concerned about ensuring that the legislation we pass is correct in the first instance, rather than rushing it through for expedient political reasons. There are those who have argued that the bill should be passed immediately because of the divisive debate which would ensue in the interim period. If that is the case, surely that demonstrates that the basis on which the bill is founded is not one of the views that the widespread community understands. Therefore, this is another reason why this bill should be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there are many legal arguments at present&mdash;they seem to be coming forward on a daily basis&mdash;as to the constitutional validity of this bill. I believe it is inevitable that the legislation will be challenged in the High Court at some stage further down the track. It is also inevitable that any legislation which is passed in this place in haste will not stand up to the detailed scrutiny of High Court examination. Therefore, inevitably, it will be shown to be flawed and all this debate and all this worry will be for virtually nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest reason why this legislation should be deferred is the obvious divergence of opinion which is apparent in our Aboriginal population regarding this bill. Not only are sections of our Aboriginal community demonstrating differing opinions; in many cases they are also demonstrating a lack of understanding and consultation. Whilst the government may be pleading that it is seeking to assist the Aboriginal community, what in fact it is doing, again, is trying to push the views of the non-Aboriginal community onto the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of instances in my own state of Tasmania of differing views between the Tasmanian Aboriginals. We had a situation at Woolnorth, on the north-west coast, in which a group of local descendants of Aboriginals made it quite clear that they were not interested in native title; they were only interested in having access to some of the lands that are sacred to them. On the other hand, we had Mr Michael Mansell and his group attacking them for having that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that even in my own little state of Tasmania, which in the early days had a reasonably small population of Tasmanian Aboriginals and where there are many fine sacred sites that need to be preserved, a lot of descendants of Aboriginal people are not interested in native title. Because of confusion and lack of consultation, they are arguing amongst themselves, with other groups and, I suppose it is fair to say, with the Aboriginal industry in Australia, because that is what Michael Mansell represents. Yet to be resolved, as Senator Brownhill said, is what effect this bill in its current form will have on the mining, pastoral, fishing, tourism and forestry industries. They are all very important industries in my state, so we have more than a passing interest in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues from Tasmania and I have all received many letters of concern from industry&mdash;in fact, some of them have even been published in the press&mdash;trying to make the public aware of the effect that this legislation will have on business investment. I know from my overseas experience, as Senator Brownhill does, that many overseas investors are of the view that this legislation will certainly not be in our best interests. It is not good enough at this time in our history, when our economy needs to be improved&mdash;it is showing signs of recovery, but it does not take much to reverse that&mdash;to have the confusion in the community which is caused by this bill. It is not what we want. At the end of the day, it is certainly going to cost potential jobs in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many criticisms of this bill. These have not been confined just to the coalition. It is a very complicated bill. The bill itself, its explanatory memoranda and the introductory speech comprise something like 250 pages, and the bill has 238 clauses. As of today, another 70 amendments have come in. Goodness knows how many more we will see in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certainly grave concerns all over Australia in the rural community about the effect that this bill will have on existing land titles. It is possible that the pre-1975 pastoral leases could be subject to a claim for co-existing native title. Any farmers who find themselves in that position will be forced into the courts. Unlike some of the Aboriginal community, they will be unable to receive the legal assistance they will need to defend their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking to a farmer only last night. With the low wool prices, the overburdening of bureaucracy upon him, and droughts, he is just about at the stage where he thinks he might walk away from it. He and his family have been in the farming game all their lives. This is just another burden, coming on top of the hardships it has experienced over the last decade, that the rural community can do without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this bill will lead to expensive and prolonged constitutional argument between the Commonwealth and the states. I believe it is totally unacceptable for the Commonwealth to attempt to manage state land systems and for the Commonwealth to impose its will upon the states undemocratically. The states are never going to accept this scenario. Once again, because the opportunity for consensus has been lost, we will end up with a bill which will only be more divisive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already spoken about the effect that this bill will have on the rural and mining communities. Currently, something like 330 million hectares, or about 43 per cent of our total land, are held under pastoral lease. Areas such as South Australia and Western Australia, where the figures are up to 55 and 44 per cent, respectively, certainly must have a lot of worries about this bill. The bill will provide the native titleholders with the right to veto and impede the economic development of such land. This will place directly at risk some of our large export earning industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of compensation has yet to be fully addressed. As has been said earlier, it seems that the Prime Minister has virtually said that there is going to be an open chequebook. I do not believe that that is a situation the Australian taxpayer should be placed in. We have to look ahead and just wonder what effect that will have on future budgets. We know that we will have an early budget next year, in May. I wonder what allowance is being made in the budget for compensation claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that what we are debating today is not just another chapter in the entire Mabo scenario. This says very little for the government's real ability to assist the Aboriginal community. Our Prime Minister has chosen to play politics and, as usual, to prefer confrontation rather than mediation. Even the government acknowledges that this legislation will assist only between five and 10 per cent of the Aboriginal community. The other 90 per cent will gain nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will not solve the concerns of most of the Aboriginals in this country. It will do little to assist them in areas such as health. Recently a fellow Tasmanian, the Federal President of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brendan Nelson, claimed that health was the most important issue facing the Aboriginal community today&mdash;not native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will set back for many years the ultimate resolution of the problems concerning the Aboriginal community. I believe it is inevitable that the government, the Democrats and the Independents will regret that they were not prepared to adopt the views of the coalition and submit this bill to a committee for more detailed and thoughtful analysis, as it should have been. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 3 June 1992 the High Court of Australia handed down its historic decision on native title in Australia. The decision was greeted by Aboriginal people and many of their supporters with jubilation, joy and hope. After 200 years, the prior occupancy of Australia by Aboriginal peoples was acknowledged by white law. Incidentally, Australia was 175 years behind the United States in taking this position, but it, too, had come to this point 200 years after the foreign occupation and invasion of American Indian people's lands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Aboriginal peoples, this is one of the first steps on the path to true recognition and justice, but it still falls far short of what they really want. What they really want is an equivalent to the treaty that former Prime Minister Bob Hawke offered them in 1988, which would finally recognise them as equals in this land and, in fact, as the original owners and occupants of this land. These are the words with which Kevin Gilbert crystallised the Aboriginal demands for sovereignty in practical terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sovereign treaty is the only mechanism in law by which our sovereignty can be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sovereign treaty is negotiated between equals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sovereign treaty is automatically in the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sovereign treaty over-rides state and federal laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sovereign treaty must never extinguish Aboriginal rights, but enshrine and protect our rights forever, under the Vienna convention on the law of treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With all domestic options exhausted, a sovereign treaty is our only peaceful way to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no reconciliation without a sovereign treaty.</PARA>
<PARA>We owe it to the oldest continuing culture in the world to do the right thing. It is not only the people who have been calling for a treaty who see the High Court judgment as extremely conservative. It was a very conservative judgment. It was trying to balance the interests and rights of all of us who now live in Australia. It tried to act in a way that would be least disruptive to the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it recognised that Aboriginal land had been illegally taken since 1788, it did not order that such lands be returned. It recognised that to do so would be unfair to all those who legally, by way of grant or purchase, own land now. It also said that Aboriginal people could not claim compensation for the theft of the past, except where such dispossession contravenes existing laws&mdash;importantly, the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975. It further said that, where land had been validly granted in the past, native title had been completely extinguished in most cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision was extremely disappointing. The one seed of truth in it, which was the exposure of terra nullius as a legal lie, led us to a different position than the one that this present legislation is taking. Because the High Court went on to say that native title still exists, or potentially exists, on all vacant crown land and that future grants over such land could still extinguish any native title on that land but could only do so in a non-discriminatory way&mdash;that is, by doing it in a way that paralleled the process of extinguishing other titles&mdash;the High Court decision gave this country an opportunity to refound itself in a totally new way, on a basis of justice. I quote from Xavier Herbert:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until we give back to the black man some of what we have taken from him, and give it back in the same spirit that it was taken&mdash;without provisos or strings to snatch it back, we shall remain what we have always been, a people without a soul, not a nation, but a community of thieves.</PARA>
<PARA>There was the spirit of opportunity to redress the injustice of 200 years; nevertheless, there was good news and bad news for Aboriginal people. The good news was that opportunity, and the bad news was that the authorisation was given to governments to extinguish it. That does not mean that, at this point in time, we have to continue that extinguishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For non-Aboriginal Australians there was also some good news and some bad news. The good news was that their valid titles were not at risk. The bad news&mdash;at least to some sections of the non-Aboriginal community&mdash;was that Aboriginal native title interests in land would have to be taken into account in future land dealings. For many of us, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, the High Court decision has presented an opportunity to see a genuine process of reconciliation between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people and a measure of restitution and reparation for the wrongs of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the brutal and self-serving campaign run by conservative vested interests over the last few months has seen those opportunities recede further and further, to the stage that we are in danger that Aboriginal people will lose what little the High Court felt able to give them. Let us remember that the High Court decision was only about the six or so per cent of Aboriginal people who have been able to maintain their traditional links with the land&mdash;the traditional people with the remnants of a culture and a way of life that once covered this vast land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irony is that the High Court decision favoured those who have been least dispossessed and offered nothing to those who have been most badly affected or dispossessed by colonisation. The government had an opportunity to redress that and the Greens want to raise the issue and speak on behalf of non-Aboriginal people who believe that even the High Court decision was a travesty of justice to those people who have suffered most in the last 200 years. To detract further from the High Court judgment would indeed be a further travesty of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditional people want their rights to land, culture and their way of life to be recognised and protected. They want to no longer feel under continual threat of dispossession. They want to be masters and mistresses of their own destiny and they want to be in control of their own sacred places in ways that accord with their tradition and laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read into the record a letter sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) by the Mindibungu Aboriginal Corporation. It expresses all of this much better than I could ever hope to. I met with the corporation at Kununurra when it was discussing the implications of this legislation. It filled me with humility that people held out the hope to the government. It filled me with shame that this legislation is all that we can offer them. The corporation gave me permission to read this letter during this second reading debate. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for this opportunity to express ourselves in relation to Mabo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned that people have been misinformed on the basis of Mabo, that Kartiya people in the cities and the towns, are suspicious or scared, the way this subject has been discussed. We the people of Billiluna, do not want other peoples land or houses. We accept the Kartiya (white person) and wish to be one in friendship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like the Kartiya to know the truth, our story. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are the first people of this land, that because we have not put up rock walls or barbed wire fences, we have as strong a right to our homelands. By our nature, it is not our way to keep people out, nor to lock ourselves in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our culture the land is our Mother. We are born of this land; we live of this land and ultimately we are returned to our Mother.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our language is the corner stone and the fence posts that determine where we live. Our tongue may differ from that of the other tribes, but that is what determines where we live. In friendship we recognise the strength of the other tribes language boundaries. Here in the Kimberley as in the rest of Australia our culture is one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not possess land, we are a part of it. In Kartiya ways, even with title, over time possession is just a fleeting moment. A lifetime in the existence of this land is nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As aboriginal people we would like you to understand we are not greedy; but we want it clearly understood that we want rights to our mother land. Rights that cannot be taken from us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of importance is the right to have use of the land for our purpose. Be it hunting for gundi (bush potatoe), linga (snake), and other bush tucker; the freedom to move through our lands without being impeded; the right to perform business and law of significance to our culture. The right to determine the use of the land, whether it is good or not good for us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand time does not stand still; that development is needed for the growth of this country. It is not our desire to stand in the way of development, providing progress will be good for all people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to share in this growth, accordingly we want a fair deal for our people, our children and our future generations, that will follow in our footsteps. We are honest and fair people in our dealings and appreciate honesty and respect in negotiations. If Companies wish to use our land they must understand our culture and respect our ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like development to be done in consultation with us on these understandings. Special areas of the land hold deep significance to our culture and cannot be disturbed. We would not dream of digging up a Kartiya burial ground or drilling for oil in a Church.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With mutual respect and understanding we can make a way for the future. Develop strong links and forge fast partnerships in development, be it mining, forestry or industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we are people of an ancient land and an old culture, our eyes follow the sun to the dawn; that of a new tomorrow. We look forward to the day when Australia acknowledges our past. That we were here before the flag of the Union Jack pierced our soil. For in our time it is but a brief tear drop.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With your assistance, perhaps Mabo can unite us all. It will give to us our rightful recognition and respect, and destroy the hatred, bigotry and suspicions of the colonial past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We thank you for listening to us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chairman and Councillors of Mindibungu.</PARA>
<PARA>So how far does this legislation enshrine the High Court decision and match the hopes of Aboriginal people like the Mindibungu? Certainly, the rhetoric from the Prime Minister and others supporting this legislation has been very high sounding. But words come cheap, and nowhere more so than on the subject of justice for Aboriginal people. No issue has been so studied and investigated. No issue has generated so many reports. In no area has correspondingly so little been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the Woodward lands rights inquiry, the Seaman land inquiry, the Commission into Racism in Australia, the Law Reform Commission report into Aboriginal customary law and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. How fine were all the words written in these reports; how often the actions fell much short of the rhetoric. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is a very good example. Of the 339 recommendations put forward in its report, very few have been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how does the legislation measure up? Paul Keating, in his address to the nation on 15 November this year, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this week I will be proposing legislation to Parliament which meets both the spirit of the High Court's decision and Australia's responsibilities and needs.</PARA>
<PARA>Does this legislation really meet the Prime Minister's own benchmark? Does it meet the spirit of the High Court decision? Will it ensure that whatever the High Court gave will not be taken away and cannot be taken away by any government acting in bad faith?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Greens believe that this legislation falls well short of the Prime Minister's own words in a number of significant areas. It takes away from the High Court decision, and in some cases gives less to Aboriginal people than what the High Court judgment gives. In other instances, it closes off avenues that should have been left to the High Court to decide in the future. The Greens WA will not be a party to legislation that leaves Aboriginal people worse off than they would have been under the High Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of real concern is the relationship of the bill to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. While the Prime Minister says that the bill is a special measure in relation to this act, in our view in order to be a special measure it has to discriminate in favour of Aboriginal people. But many of the provisions of this bill discriminate against Aboriginal people. For example, where the bill extinguishes property rights, they are the property rights of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the bill validates past discriminatory legislation based on the legal lie of terra nullius, which could again be used to authorise further discriminatory acts. This bill does not make it clear that, where such inconsistencies occur, the Racial Discrimination Act prevails. It must be amended in order to make that quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the stated aims is to preserve native title to the maximum extent possible. The bill does the opposite. Native title rights to waterways and fishing have been extinguished in a wholesale way. This could have serious implications for coastal Aboriginal communities who rely on them as a source of sustenance. In the area of commercial leases, be they pastoral, tourist or other leases, native title will be extinguished if the lease is found to be invalid due to native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not required in order to validate. Leases could be validated with the concept of coexistence. There is a certain irony in the fact that, while it does not seem to be obvious to the government in the way that it has introduced the legislation, it is, surprisingly, an area where Richard Court is in agreement with our perception. I quote a letter from him which I received this week. He referred to the federal legislation and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. It contains major departures from the Mabo principles; </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-it requires the extinguishment of native title rights as a condition of the validation of pastoral leases. Under the Mabo principles, native title rights are capable of co-existing with pastoral leases and other interests in land . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Another reason he cites for the failure of the federal legislation is that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-it requires the extinguishment of native title rights by compulsory acquisition before pastoral leases and certain other interests in land and waters can be granted in the future. Under the Mabo principles, native title and other interests can co-exist in respect of the same area.</PARA>
<PARA>I hasten to add that this in no way indicates my support for the WA legislation, which extinguishes native title and replaces it with a form of traditional usage. But it indicates how ironic it is that the Premier of Western Australia, who has put up such discriminatory legislation, is also capable of seeing the way in which the federal legislation discriminates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of pastoral leases is a very serious one to the Greens. It is of fundamental importance because many traditional communities in Western Australia live on pastoral leases. What is very worrying is that little effort has been made to find out exactly who and where the people are whose native title rights will be extinguished by the action of this legislation that is under consideration today. It may well be that these people will not know until the day arrives when they are denied access or are thrown off their traditional lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, in his address to the nation, described this legislation as an opportunity to restore the age-old link between Aboriginal land and culture. If native title is summarily extinguished on traditional lands under pastoral lease, this bill will achieve just the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of this is the Miriuwung and Gajerrong people in the Ord River areas of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Ninety per cent of their traditional lands are under pastoral lease, yet they have never given up their connection to their country. They have maintained their traditional connection, despite the disruptions and dispossessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They wrote to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In their submission, they said that they simply refuse to accept the extinguishment of their rights by this legislation. They believe that the coexistence of native title and leases is the right way to go. I will quote from their submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Council's view&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Miriuwung Gajerrong council&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that native title is extinguished on nearly all Miriuwung and Gajerrong land as a result of this Bill and as such it is unjust, contravenes the Racial Discrimination Act, and destroys the traditional social structure of the Miriuwung and Gajerrong Traditional Owners, and traditional groups across the north of the continent generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even though existing statutory usage and habitation rights are confirmed by this Bill they remain statutory rights only not common law rights. As such they can be removed from the statutes depending on the policies of successive administrations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Vested pastoral interests are already pressing an uncompromising and aggressive line with this Council in stating that they consider native title to be extinguished as a result of the High Court's decision and the impending Bill. Therefore the Council's constituents register their mounting fears in this area and seek an advice from the Senate Committee and the Party members concerned what their Committee and Party position is on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a plea from people who, in Paul Keating's words, had a ribbon of rights that has been exchanged for a basketful of rights. That is, the provisions in this bill for the conversion of pastoral lease to the native title equivalent, if it is in the control of Aboriginal people, has been done on the proviso that Aboriginal people who would have had a potential for native title rights are having that extinguished. This bill validates any pastoral lease which may be regarded as invalid because of native title rights. </PARA>

I hope I can cover my remarks in the time available. I will omit all the bits that refer to the failings of this present legislation because, as has been pointed out, there will be an opportunity to discuss them in the committee stage. There has been detailed scrutiny given to this bill by the Greens and other groups which have brought submissions to us. We have severe concerns. Those concerns are not being addressed by the government's proposed amendments. If the bill remains in its present form it will be clearly unacceptable to the Greens. The bill requires amendments that are far greater than the government's proposed amendments. While there are some good points they really do go back on the intentions of the bill. That is an unsatisfactory position from the Greens (WA) point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite such glaring faults in the bill there are many people who believe the bill has merit and want to see it passed. They claim that the land acquisition fund, the social justice package, the conversion of pastoral leases to native title, the recognition of native title, the possible overriding effect of the Western Australian legislation and the tribunal claims system make up for any deficiencies in this bill. I am afraid that the Greens cannot agree with that. The reality does not come up to the rhetoric. While there will be some Aboriginal people who will benefit under this legislation, it will mostly be those who already have something in 1993 and those who have very little may have even less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mabo was about traditional people and their traditional lands and customs. Nothing in this bill should detract from that. However, there is an obligation on Australia as a country to deal with those people for whom Mabo did not represent justice or a fair reparation for the treatment that they have received at the hands of the non-Aboriginal community for 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also comment on the process used to design this bill. The whole thing has been done in a very political way, like a deal. It is a very white rather than an Aboriginal way. This has marginalised and distressed the very people that this legislation was meant to be all about&mdash;that is, the traditional Aboriginal elders, lawmen and women. The way Aboriginal law would have dealt with this would be to let the elders of each community speak for their land. They respect the right of other Aboriginal communities to speak for their own lands and they stay silent on it. What we have done is try to use our white bureaucratic system to wash over the voices and the needs of those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A small and self-selected group of Aboriginal people who do represent very different groups within the Aboriginal community have chosen to negotiate this with the government. In doing that they have been dealing with the rights of other Aboriginal people. Make no mistake, despite the claims to the contrary, the traditional people have not been fully consulted as anyone who heard the evidence given to the Senate committee would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly saddening is the response of the opposition to this whole issue. I would like to make it quite clear that there are not just two positions in the chamber; there are three. Firstly, there is the opposition's denial of the need to redress the injustices of the past 200 years and a view that it is unjust to positively discriminate for Aboriginal people. The second is the government's position. It has a fear of fully dealing with the historical injustice because of anxiety about the consequences on the country and a desire to placate everyone, including Aboriginal interests. The Democrats are supporting the government's view and are also speaking out on behalf of those negotiating with the government for Aboriginal rights not to be further undermined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens position is that until the truth of the historical injustice is acknowledged no healing or reconciliation is possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly to the Native Title Bill. It is an important bill. I want to put on the record my opposition to it. I do not propose to deal with the technicalities of the bill because we are going to have a very long committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with a few broad principles. I think the principles transcend all else in this case. The first principle that I want to enunciate is that Australia's destiny as a nation is as one people, as Australians, in one land, Australia. The common link that binds us all is the link of Australian citizenship. It links us all irrespective of our ethnic backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle that is very important in this case is the equality of everyone before the law. There are no special cases. There can be only one law. We are all equally judged before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the Racial Discrimination Act and its provisions. I also accept the High Court decision in relation to Mabo. Having read the determination of the High Court twice, I must note that the High Court had enough sense to carefully define the nature of native title. It certainly did not promote the general transposition of what it found in relation to Mabo to the Australian mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is quite unnecessary in its present form. It is far worse than that. It is socially very divisive for the fabric of the Australian community. That probably is its greatest defect. It is unconstitutional. It moves against the provisions of the constitution into the whole subject of land title&mdash;something which has always been the preserve of the state and is legally the province of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is confusing legislation. As the Chairman of BHP said, `it is like reading porridge'. It is complex. It is also commercially very destructive for Australia. Let us not have any criticism from the other side about the economic welfare of Australia because the welfare of all of us turns on having a strong Australian economy. We all have a vested interest in that. There are no exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is commercially very destructive for Australia because it operates to create uncertainty and extremely high risk in two industries&mdash;the pastoral industry and the mining industry. They are two industries which provide between them about 80 per cent of Australia's export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final criticism of the bill is that it is totally unfunded. As the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) on many occasions was forced to admit in question time, the government simply has no idea what this bill will cost the Australian taxpayer. The funding of bodies, such as the land acquisition scheme, for those Aboriginals who do not have the legal pathway to claim native title for land, the huge bureaucracy, the appeals tribunals and all the other things that this bill sets up, result in an enormous cost&mdash;a cost which runs into billions of dollars. It would be quite irresponsible for any legislature or any legislator to give the government an open cheque until it has done an economic analysis of what is involved here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court judgment was handed down about 18 months ago on 3 June 1992. It is only very recently that the Native Title Bill has been presented to the parliament. Late last night we had a dispute in this chamber when it was revealed that the government had more than 50 amendments to it. Goodness knows how many amendments the Democrats and the Greens have. We were asked to go into a debate on this bill without having seen probably well in excess of 100 amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appalling management that the parliament is presented again with a blank cheque. We just do not know what we are voting on. We have not had time to study the amendments. There is absolutely no hurry on this. The High Court decision was handed down 18 months ago, and yet the government is telling us that it has to have this bill by tomorrow night or Friday. There is no justification for that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the principal defect of the bill, namely, its divisiveness of the Australian society. It is very sad and very unnecessary. There is an enormous store of goodwill in the Australian population towards Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Australians are genuinely horrified at the child and adult mortality rates in that community&mdash;Aboriginals have a life expectancy about 20 years less than that of European citizens of Australia&mdash;and as to the public health of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, to say nothing of standards of living in general and the educational standards attained by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. There are very real concerns in the Australian community about public health, welfare and education. Above all, there is a readiness to pay big money to correct them, provided it meets the target of improving public health, reducing infant mortality and prolonging the lives of members of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find there is very genuine support in the community to look after those genuine welfare problems. But I have found no support at all in the Australian community for the Native Title Bill per se. The reason is quite simple: the public knows that there is nothing in this bill which will improve the real problems that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community faces. The protagonists of this bill have admitted that 95 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will not be affected. The things the people in that community suffer from, with respect to public health and education, will not be addressed in any way at all by the provisions of this bill. There is a real possibility, because of the divisiveness that could be created in the community, that they may well be worse off. That would be a tragedy. It is an avoidable tragedy and it need not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a community we have to address the health and educational problems of the Aboriginal community. They can be addressed and they must be addressed, but they have to be addressed on the basis of need, not on the basis of race. All Australians are entitled to the same standards of public health, education and welfare. That is not held in dispute at all by the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to my first principle, whereby one people in one country are equal before the law. It is a bit worse than that because this bill has exposed to the Australian community some people who are pushing socially extreme views. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) technically has committed an act in relation to this which would be described as a folie de grandeur. His emotion has completely replaced any reason in dealing with the matter. His Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is in precisely the same emotional state. Some commentators in the community have also presented a false and unbalanced view, and I will come to them in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not demean the Senate by descending to the Prime Minister's level and engaging in racist arguments. Suffice it to say though, that I will never be intimidated by the Prime Minister or anyone else who alleges that anyone who questions this bill is promoting a racist argument. Those people ought to reflect on the fate of Senator McCarthy in the United States nearly 30 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is for the living&mdash;for the present and for the future. I cannot undo the wrongs of the past and I will have no part of the guilt industry. I think there is a rather unbalanced view of history about which seems to say that all the faults of previous centuries were by the Europeans against the Aboriginals. If we go back and look at what happened sociologically in Europe with the predecessors of the Western democracies, we find that all social conditions were very repressive according to contemporary standards at that time. Some of the convicts were shipped to Australia because they stole goods that did not exceed half a crown in value. If the goods exceeded half a crown, they were hung; they were not transported. In those days society was terribly oppressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only try to see that fairness prevails in the Australian community with respect to contemporary standards. With the best will in the world we cannot go back and correct the wrongs of years ago. By all means let us correct the welfare and the health deficiencies that I was talking about before, but let us not bog ourselves down, flagellating ourselves about the wrongs that occurred in the past. They are beyond change; they just cannot be altered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that concerns me is the argument from the Prime Minister that somehow or other one group of Australians has a prior claim over another to support from the government in this direction. I do not feel inferior to the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community at all because it has been here for thousands of years longer than my forebears. My forebears have all been here for probably 130 or 140 years on average. For my own part, I do not feel superior to any migrant who came to Australia last week or last year. I see us all as Australian citizens and equal before the law in this country. If we have needs, those needs are to be supported, but we do that because of the condition that we are in&mdash;not because of the number of years we have been here, the colour of our skin or our ethnic background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier some of the commentators who have got into the public debate. There have been some people with a rather dubious and revisionist view of history. Tragically, they have incited the Aboriginal community to have higher expectations than can be attained or delivered by this government. Some of them even go so far as to virtually incite violence if those expectations are not fulfilled and talk about the comparison of minorities in other countries. I think that it is grossly and wilfully irresponsible of those people to take such a position in public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill is unworkable. There is no legal authority in this country that thinks that this bill can be turned into an act and implemented. The best that could be said about it is that it will be a paradise for lawyers and that hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent in legal fees. But the faults are far worse than the transfer of funds into the pockets of the lawyers. The bill is characterised by its directionless complexity. It will have an enormous effect on the pastoral and the mining industries because it creates massive uncertainty. I believe that as a consequence of that it will affect the welfare of all Australians because it will have a major economic impact on us. The bill cannot survive. If it passes this parliament, it will be repealed at some future date. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was also a history of extremely effective industry campaigns against attempts to legislate in favour of Aboriginals and land and no Western Australian can forget the harshness and I think the powerful impact on the Western Australian community of a quite brilliant anti-Aboriginal campaign waged in the mid 1980s, with the spectre of a black hand building a brick wall, presumably between the island residents of my own town in Perth and the El Dorado of the riches of the interior. It was powerful anti-Aboriginal propaganda, and I have absolutely no doubt that the capacity of people to whip up hatred against Aboriginal people is very great.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a letter dated 10 December 1993 from the Australian Mining Industry Council. Included with the letter was a booklet. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I attach for your information a booklet prepared by Messrs Freehill, Hollingdale and Page entitled "Native Title in Australia". The booklet was not prepared at the mining industry's request.</PARA>
<PARA>Those words led me to think that this might be an impartial document. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the comments made in the booklet certainly reinforce many of the points which the mining industry has been making&mdash;for instance:</PARA>
<PARA>I carried out a little further examination. I noted that the authors of the booklet were Bruno Camarri and Peter van Hattem. The two gentlemen named are not impartial to this whole debate. It cannot be said that the authors of that booklet, which was not commissioned by the mining industry, are impartial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs took evidence at public hearings in Perth on Friday, 3 December, Mr van Hattem appeared before the committee. He gave his name and address as Peter van Hattem, partner in Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, 15 William Street, Perth. His opening comments were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to explain that I am a legal practitioner. I have been asked to assist the pastoralists today and later the fishing representatives and also the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Camarri, the other author, also appeared at the hearing. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report, he is Mr Bruno Giovanni Camarri, legal adviser to the Western Australian government, 19th Floor, Capita Centre, 197 St Georges Terrace, Perth. His opening comments were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am here in my capacity as legal adviser to the West Australian government. The submission that I am part of has been prepared in conjunction with Mr Humphrey.</PARA>
<PARA>He was also with the Western Australian government. Clearly, the AMIC is attempting to distort the truth and change things around. Really, it does not need to do that. This is complex legislation, it is important legislation and it is valued legislation. The AMIC should merely address the facts. The subterfuge that has been brought to the fore and then exposed in respect of this letter and booklet says more about the representatives of the Australian Mining Industry Council than it does about the subject matter of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another Liberal Senate colleague of mine, Senator Sue Knowles, has also contributed to this debate. Senator Knowles was very indignant about the fact that a large number of government amendments were presented to the Senate today. She expressed some difficulty in dealing with them. I have looked at the amendments that the government has prepared. Some of them reflect the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which met for over four days, not three and a half days, as Senator O'Chee said. Included in the very first amendment is one of the recommendations that the committee made about setting up some form of monitoring body&mdash;a joint parliamentary committee&mdash;to oversee how the legislation is geared up. From memory, the government has presented to the Senate 14 pages of amendments. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has legislation which is supposed to reflect the High Court's decision on Mabo. This government inspired bill was introduced into the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia. How many pages of amendments did the Western Australian government present when its legislation reached the second reading stage? It had 20 pages&mdash;not 14 pages&mdash;full of amendments to put into its own legislation. This feigned indignation that we heard from Senator Knowles here today has not made its mark at all. </PARA>

Indeed, all 12 senators in this chamber from Western Australia have responsibilities to the electors who put us here. They made their decisions at two general elections. We have responsibilities to them. I know it is a vain hope, but I make a plea to my colleagues on the other side of the chamber to stand by their constituents and act in a way that reflects the common law of Australia that was made in the High Court decision in June last year. They should forget their vested interests. They should not worry&mdash;all they can give them is a quid. By voting the right way on this piece of legislation, they will be protecting their own dignity. It is, after all, the Year of Indigenous People. It will only be so for a few more days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Native Title Bill obviously generates a great deal of emotion and a great deal of feeling. Senator McKiernan's contribution to the debate shows that par excellence. I do not wish to go into all the points that Senator McKiernan raised. Many of them have been dealt with and debated already and I am sure that many others will also be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan raised one point that I cannot let go without comment. I say very sincerely and very seriously that it really concerns me greatly as an Australian to find accusations made that somehow or other, because people are opposed, for whatever reason, to the particular bill that is now before the parliament, they are somehow or other engaged in a campaign of hate. In my view, that is a quite unacceptable statement to make. I certainly reject it absolutely and totally on behalf of myself, I am sure all members of the coalition and, I would think, all those millions of Australians who have expressed genuine concern about aspects of this bill. I would have to say that the old argument of Lenin, `If you are not for me, you're my enemy' is a very dangerous route to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the consequence of the debate that has been taking place not just in this parliament but in the community for a long time now and certainly since the High Court's Mabo decision came down in June 1992, particularly as reflected in the legislation now produced by the government and being debated here, is that that bill will divide Australians rather than unite us. Indeed, the debate is showing the extreme way in which that is happening now. From my own personal position as the coalition's shadow minister for multicultural Australia, citizenship and immigration, I have a very deep abiding interest, as do all Australians, in ensuring that what we do in our very culturally rich and tolerant society does not work against the unity and strength in diversity that we have in our society. This bill does in fact do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill for that reason&mdash;let alone the technical and other problems associated with it&mdash;really ought to be taken back to the drawing board and given much longer and more detailed consideration. Although I know it is late in the day and a further plea will probably fall on stony ground, once again I continue to urge the Australian Democrats to think much more carefully and closely about this bill having to be rushed through before Christmas. If this bill is to be passed before Christmas, despite the fact that we will have a very long debate on it here, it is still being rushed through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one reason that the government wants to have this bill passed before Christmas is based on the claim that, if it is not passed in that period, it would have difficulty in holding together the necessary coalitions of interest. In other words, the fragile consensus would fall apart if the bill were deferred until February or March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is perhaps the most important piece of legislation that any of us here will ever debate while we are in the parliament. To think that this legislation will be based on a fragile consensus which, in the government's own thinking, will fall apart if its passage is deferred for a couple of months is surely the strongest statement that one could make to urge its deferment and further consideration. As I think was said by my colleagues who were members of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which produced the report on the Native Title Bill, national legislation on such a vital policy issue should not stand on such fragile foundations. For the government to suggest also that somehow or other this bill is the only appropriate response to the High Court's decision on Mabo is absolutely improper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay great tribute to my colleagues Senators Vanstone, Ellison and O'Chee for the great job they did on the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in the very limited time available to them, because the minor parties were not prepared to see this bill given proper legislative committee consideration. My colleagues have rightly made the point that there are many responses, legislatively or in terms of the parliament, to the High Court's decision on Mabo which in no way would take away from the High Court decision but, on the contrary, enable it to be recognised in administrative law in a proper way that brings the nation together and does not divide it. It could be done in a way that brings Australians together and does not divide them, that seeks a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the states rather than the approach contained in this bill, which is a truly centralist bill of enormous proportions. Because of that, this bill strikes at the whole fabric of our federal system. But even worse or equally bad, it smacks of the worst possible form of paternalism that one could imagine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is surely the ultimate and bitter irony for this government&mdash;a government that preaches that it wants to enhance the rights of all Australians and to enable them properly to participate in the running and decision making of this country&mdash;to take such a paternalistic approach to arguably the most important piece of legislation we are ever going to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not just being said by people on this side of politics; it is being said across the spectrum. It is being said by many leaders in the Aboriginal communities. It is being said by people like Charles Perkins, by people like Pat O'Shane, and by people like Lois O'Donoghue. It was said in my own state, in my local newspaper in Brunswick a couple of weeks ago, by the Chief Executive Officer of the Aborigines Advancement League, Reg Blow. He quite rightly said that this bill will affect only 10 per cent of the total Aboriginal population in Australia. Therefore, by definition it will disadvantage the other 90 per cent, particularly those members of the Aboriginal community who are urban Australians. They are just some of the reasons why the coalition feels so strongly, along with so many other Australians, about the difficulties and the dangers of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill will have major effects on the future economic, social, judicial and probably political structure of this country. First, let me say&mdash;and others have said it, but I think it bears repeating&mdash;that the High Court's decision on Mabo 2 really was an extremely dangerous example of the court making a political and social statement under the auspices of legal interpretation. Overturning terra nullius and establishing a new form of land right, native title, regardless of whether one thinks that is a good or bad idea, is surely the proper responsibility of the parliament and of the people, not of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court in effectively parading itself as an alternative legislature is irrevocably politicising itself, its decisions and its members. As my colleagues have said, it will inevitably embroil the High Court in political controversy; it is certainly a new direction for the High Court. There are already signs that this approach has lowered and will further lower its standing in the community. That outcome would be most regrettable because the High Court is the pinnacle of our judiciary and the judiciary, of course, is one the fundamental cornerstones of our system of government and institutional arrangements in Australia. It is of the utmost importance that that court maintain and be seen to maintain its integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real criticism that has been levelled at the High Court's decision is not, as the Chief Justice has suggested, that courts do not make law. The real criticism has focused on the revolutionary nature of the court's Mabo decision in overturning 205 years of settled land law. This issue or principle of the role of the High Court is critical and of national importance. As I have said, the parliament is the fundamental element of our basic institutions that should make the law, not unelected judges. As my colleague Mr Reith said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any attempt by the High Court to make the law and usurp the role of the Parliament, in circumstances where it concludes that the Parliament has abrogated its responsibility, will only ignite a furious and damaging debate in which the Court's reputation could be severely damaged . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I would add, that would be accompanied by all the dangers that holds in respect to our whole system of institutions, institutional arrangements and federation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's approach to the bill has been based on three essential pillars of principle. They are worth restating because I think there is an impression in some areas of the community, fanned by quite false and misleading interpretations of the coalition's attitude to this matter, that somehow or other we want to buck the High Court decision on Mabo. That is absolutely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first basic pillar of principle on which our whole approach to this is based is in fact a recognition of the High Court's decision that native title exists nationally at common law. We may have differing views amongst ourselves as to whether the High Court decision was good or bad but the fact remains that we recognise that the High Court decision does exist nationally at common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second basic pillar of principle is the recognition that native title is protected by the existing federal law; namely, the Racial Discrimination Act. We reaffirm our support of the Racial Discrimination Act. The third basic pillar of principle is our recognition that the states have constitutional responsibility for land management and the need for this to be maintained, because to do otherwise would, as I said earlier, undermine the whole functioning of our federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three principles which we have brought to our approach to this particular bill are based on a detailed discussion paper released in June this year by the coalition's Mabo subcommittee after very extensive consultation with Aboriginal communities throughout Australia&mdash;a process of consultation that I must say is absolutely unparalleled and totally unmatched by anything that this government has done. This government has adopted the same corporatist approach to this piece of legislation as it has adopted to government during its period in office; that is, it picks out half a dozen people to talk to, namely, the big players in what the particular game is, forgets everyone else in the community who may have a vital interest in it and then presents to the rest of the community as a fait accompli findings, results and decisions based on that corporatist approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So our discussion paper was produced only after very extensive consultation with Aboriginal communities and others throughout Australia. The main points of that discussion paper very clearly demonstrated the consistency of our whole approach to this quite crucial subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, that paper said: first, that all Australians should be treated equally under the law; secondly, that titles should be validated immediately; thirdly, that native title is the law&mdash;we accept that; we recognise that&mdash;fourthly, that jobs and development should not be jeopardised; fifthly, that mineral rights should be protected; and, sixthly, that the process of reconciliation should certainly continue to be pursued but that the Mabo issue and reconciliation are two quite separate things and should be settled separately. Indeed, I would go further and say that the basic reason for our view on that is that if the government does not separate the two, it will muck them both up. That is precisely what is happening with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economically, the bill will lead to continued uncertainty about property titles and rights; hence, a reduction in investment in key mining, pastoral, exploration, fisheries, tourist industries and others. Jobs and export creating developments, which are currently under consideration, will either be shelved altogether, postponed indefinitely or reassessed to achieve higher returns in lieu of the higher risks or scaled back to minimise exposure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many business leaders in Australia have expressed their concerns. They are not the run of the mill business people; they are amongst the most responsible and non-political business people. I cannot think of too many others who would want less to get into a political fight than some of them&mdash;people like Mr Prescott from BHP, Mr Barnett from Pasminco, Michael Folie from Shell Australia and so on. They have felt so strongly about this matter that they have been taking out advertisements throughout the nation pointing out the dangers of this legislation and urging, not that the whole thing be scrapped, not that we forget about everything that has happened&mdash;we cannot do that because there is a High Court decision, which we all accept&mdash;but rather that the politicians, in particular, should go back and have another look at it to see whether there is not a better way of achieving the results that we all want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see Senator Margetts here because I say to her, and particularly the Democrats: please, let us have another look at this legislation; let us take our time on it. Another couple of months will not make any difference. Let us hope that we can produce something that will unite rather than divide this nation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the constitution, which was negotiated virtually by conservative parties who were then in charge of the colonies, it quite consciously froze out the Aboriginal people from being recognised in terms of their right to vote and their right to be recognised as people in the community. </PARA>

When people are given some rights, whether they are entitled to them or not, and there is some argument about it, there will always be division in the community. If our concern about possible division leads us not to give justice to the Aboriginal people, then I, for one, would be totally ashamed of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the role of the states, which of course looked after the Aboriginal issue up until 1967, when the referendum gave rights to the Commonwealth government, their record is shocking.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years back in the 1960s I was involved in an organisation called the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Its only support was its own activities and many of the left wing and fairly moderate trade unions. It did not get any assistance from governments as such, but it certainly did from some politicians on both sides of the house. For that, the council was grateful, and I recall `Nugget' Coombs being very helpful in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been brought about because people have not been dealt with equally before the law over time. I must reflect that there are many people on the other side of the house who say that people should be equal before the law but who have belonged to organisations that have never before raised this question when Aboriginals have been disadvantaged. In the 1970s we had situations like the one in the gulf where the police came in one day in boats and took away a group of people who had lived in a particular area for many years and burnt down their accommodation because it was not convenient for them to be in that area as far as a particular mining company was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot say that this bill is absolutely perfect and that there will not be some problems that will have to be dealt with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Short pointed out, the Native Title Bill is arguably one of the most important bills to come before this parliament, certainly in the experience of those in the chamber and possibly since Federation.

I believe, along with my party, that the consequences of this bill for Australia will be adverse to Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people alike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party is opposing this bill, and Senator Short outlined very carefully the reasons why. In summary, the bill is unjust and unworkable. The High Court decision on Mabo should have been left to the states to implement. Nothing the judges said in their decisions required this bill or anything like it to come before this parliament. The bill tramples on our constitution, which gives the states responsibility for land control and management. I say to those who support the bill: when you trample on a nation's constitution, you do so at great peril because that establishes rules which apply to one and all&mdash;your opponents and your friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inevitably, the Mabo decision of the High Court was going to cause a legal upheaval of significant magnitude, but this bill complicates an already difficult decision. Some 102 years ago, Sir Henry Parkes, one of the driving forces of our federation, made a speech in the Sydney Town Hall. The speech was entitled `One people: one destiny'. These words became the slogan of the federation movement which created Australia as we know it today. It aptly describes, in my view, the philosophy with which this nation should continue to move forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are radical groups with a separatist agenda. There is a move to encourage the United Nations to reinterpret the self-determination clauses in human rights conventions so that they apply to indigenous peoples who are already part of a sovereign country. Such a reinterpretation would enable Aboriginal radicals to argue that they had a right to establish a separate Aboriginal nation. This notion, happily, is rejected by most people in the Aboriginal community. Nevertheless, there are those who, rather than talking about one people with one destiny, would see a divided nation with separate destinies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is profound disquiet in the Australian community about the Mabo bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is great unease in the community about Mabo. This is not due to any lack of concern about the appalling conditions under which so many Aboriginal people live in this country. There is no question that many Aboriginal people suffer serious unemployment, health, educational and housing problems. Of course, Australia and the Aboriginal communities themselves must address these problems. There is no doubt that the ALP government's policies in these areas have failed to date and it is the expectation of us all that as serious problems have been identified they should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deep-seated concern about the Native Title Bill is not due, as some would allege&mdash;I think Senator McKiernan may have raised this issue&mdash;to complaints from the mining and pastoral industries, well based as those complaints are. It is fundamentally due, I believe, to the fact that there is a fear in the Australian community that we are setting up laws which, however much we attempt to gloss over it, address disadvantage on the basis of race, rather than the disadvantage itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Senator Ian Macdonald expressed this point very eloquently in his speech earlier in this debate. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>As in virtually all significant political debates, there are clashing principles which are very difficult to reconcile. On the one hand, as I have said, there is the great Australian value that all people are equal under the law and that laws should apply to all, regardless of race, religion or creed. I think Senator O'Chee made that point rather well. On the other hand, there is a view&mdash;and this is stressed by people on the other side of the chamber&mdash;that a historical wrong has been committed and the only way to right this wrong is through special laws which apply to particular groups. Senator Chamarette expressed the view in her speech that unless this historical injustice is acknowledged, there is no chance of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that for much of our history, Aboriginal people did not enjoy the same rights as others&mdash;and of course that is to be deplored&mdash;but in the last 20 or 30 years we have ensured, through quite a number of ways, and above all with the goodwill and support of our people, that all Australians must be equal under law. It is my fear that we are going to reverse this principled position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that no-one would look back on Australia's history of relations with Aboriginal people and feel anything but despair. Nevertheless, there is one lesson to be learnt from this appalling record.

If this bill passes the Senate, it will be seen as another historical failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether we make a mistake when we think we can only deal with the Aboriginal issue on the basis of thinking about a collective and a community. This chamber, with its diversity of people with different values and different views, deals with those people, essentially, by emphasising the individual relations between people. To an extent, we can look at what are seen to be common problems with the Aboriginal people and address those, but essentially reconciliation takes place between the individual people in the suburbs of our cities and in the country towns. The worst way to affect that process is to give people special rights and privileges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be an argument as to whether a bill granting native title is inherently racist or, as some would argue, is merely recognising a particular group of people who happened by historical circumstance to be the first settlers in this country. That is an intellectual debate, and people of goodwill will take different views. In my view, there is no argument that this bill, in the way it seeks to define native title and the legal superstructure with which it constructs that definition, does confer special and particular rights. For example, there is no reason why mining or the compulsory acquisition of land should be restricted in native title land in a way that is different from virtually all other interests in land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunals and the Federal Court, which will be used to assess native title claims, require that there be an Aboriginal assessor. This can be interpreted in no other way than as an attempt to bias the court decision. The original Mabo decision required no such assessment. This is a Mr Keating addition to the original Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fund applies only to people of Aboriginal origin. The purpose of this fund is to address the problems of Aboriginal people who will not be able to benefit directly from the Mabo decision&mdash;on some estimates, up to 90 per cent. This fund applies only to people of Aboriginal origin. We should be mindful of the comments of Senator Ian Macdonald on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court Mabo decision required no such fund. This has nothing to do with what the judges were talking about. There is an expectation that this fund will enable Aboriginal people in cities to purchase land. A non-Aboriginal person in exactly the same circumstances has no such entitlement or claim on the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great concern that this bill does not spell out in any detail how this fund will operate. I believe the government is being deliberately deceptive in the bill. The operation of the fund will be left entirely to subordinate legislation. These regulations come into effect until they are disallowed in this chamber&mdash;if they are. I would be very interested to see why the scrutiny of bills committee allowed this clause to go through without comment. With these actions, the government has raised fears in the community that special rights and privileges are being established. That is why support for this bill is eroding and will continue to erode. In my view, the Australian people will not accept a position which allows for two people with two destinies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me briefly list the huge uncertainties which Australia is now facing as a result of this bill. There is a question of whether the bill is constitutional. I think Mr Court has already signalled that there will be a High Court challenge. Under this bill, at this stage, there are no accredited states to administer the bill, and the Commonwealth has no titles office. How can anyone in Australia acquire a secure title with such uncertainty? The terms of the bill are so profoundly complex that they would encourage interpretations and legal challenges for every matter handled under it. The procedures specified in the bill create the potential for an effective veto on exploration and mining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recognition of the Senate's leeway earlier, I will not be using my full allocated time so that it will not be seen that the Greens are using more than our allocation in this debate. It is important at the outset to clarify what we are debating here today. The Native Title Bill is a response to the so-called Mabo High Court decision and, as a consequence, should be dealing with the concerns and needs of the Aboriginal people, not the desire of the mining and pastoral industries. I have used the word `should' advisedly, because the bill as it is presented here is more accurately described as a resource security bill. It is one of the most crucial aspects of the concerns of the Greens (WA).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette and I have been criticised in this place for striving for the perfect, the unattainable. This criticism is unwarranted. We have acknowledged in our discussions and negotiations on this bill that we cannot turn back the clock and, unfortunately, cannot undo the injustices perpetrated on the Aboriginal people in this country. Our concern, however, is that the compromises that are the inevitable result of negotiations on issues such as this have favoured white landowners and leaseholders at the expense of Aboriginal people&mdash;the creation of a new terra nullius. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining industry, perhaps surprisingly, has been very critical of this bill. The President of the Mining Industry Council, Peter Barnett, was reported as saying that this bill will jeopardise development and diminish and delay investment in Australia because of the uncertainty it created. CRA Chief Executive, John Ralph, also jumped on the bandwagon recently to claim that his company would be increasing overseas investment at the expense of local spending due to the uncertainty associated with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only suggest that such statements are part of the ongoing lobbying campaign by these industry groups whose only concern is their profit margins. In that regard, however, recent reports in the financial pages confirm that the statements by Mr Ralph and Mr Barnett are not supported by facts. I note from a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> dated 8 December 1993 that the minerals industry earned $2.3 billion in profit in the last financial year despite the `supposed threat of Mabo' hanging over its head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the often quoted claims from mining industry representatives is that mining investments and projects create local employment, both directly and through trickle down and multiplier effects. On a recent visit I made to Kalgoorlie, this claim was refuted by many locals who cited evidence of fly-in fly-out work forces who take their money back to New Zealand or the eastern states. Much of the profit from mining ventures also travels overseas with the foreign companies that invest in this country and earn substantial rewards from using Australia as a quarry for the rest of the world. This is the industry that the government is so keen to placate and for which we wish to provide resource security. The need for such security is questionable. Currently, the mining industry has the right to claim over 90 per cent of the land in Australia for mining, exploration and associated activities. What more does it want?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I wish to make in this debate is a philosophical one and relates to the need for all Australian people to learn from the Aboriginal people who have lived on and with this land for many thousands of years. Europeans are only newcomers to this country and, despite their legal control over much of the land, have failed to realise that it is not ownership that is the most important issue here but being part of the land and caring for the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have much to learn from indigenous people all over the world about the spiritual and physical connection with the land. In the short time that we have lived on this land we have managed to destroy much of the ecological value of the country. This is nowhere more evident than in the pastoral industry where pastures have been overgrazed and pastoral leases mismanaged to such an extent that many of these properties are virtually worthless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, for example, 47 per cent of the pastoral leases south of the Kimberley were found to be non-viable in the recent inquiry into the pastoral industry. In the Kimberley region, the Kimberley pastoral industry inquiry found that only 21 per cent of the 103 leases in the region had the productive resource capability to maintain a viable operation in the long term. The agriculture department has estimated that the annual cost of the resource lost to the pastoral industry in Western Australia as a result of land degradation is $37 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in that context, and in the context of this debate, the pastoral industry is lobbying the Western Australian government for perpetual tenure when the current leases expire in 2015. This will result a situation where 38 per cent of Western Australia will be effectively granted to less than 500 people. Where is the equity in that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal people have lived with this land for thousands of years and learnt to care for it because they realised, as many from the green movement realise today, that the ecosystems in which we live&mdash;the land, air, water and biodiversity&mdash;are our life support systems. Destroy them and we put our own wellbeing at risk. The point is crucial in the context of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be examining this issue in the context of ownership, economics, and profits. We should be addressing the concerns of future generations and looking for ways in which we can all live together in this land in a truly sustainable manner. A perpetuation of the economic rationalist approach to these issues will not address the fundamental concerns of social justice, social equity and ecological sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Native Title Bill is seriously flawed in its current form in that it does not adequately address the concerns the Greens have raised and it does not provide Aboriginal people&mdash;the first people of this land&mdash;with the opportunity to maintain or re-establish their connections with the land of which they are such an integral part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that this bill will continue to lock many Aboriginal people into a dependency cycle&mdash;a dependency cycle which is controlled by the descendants of the very people who robbed them of their heritage over 200 years ago.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discussion of what the High Court's "native title" decision really means has been obscured by legalistic terminology and extremist interpretations from both sides of the debate. An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> (July 31) summed up the need for rational consideration of the issue when it commended Deaths in Custody Royal Commissioner Hal Wootten's succinct explanation:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Mabo simply recognised that this continent once belonged to many Aboriginal peoples, each part being occupied by a particular group who had customary rights to it. Over two centuries most of it had been irretrievably taken from them piece by piece without compensation. Where this had happened, it could not now be undone. But, through all the travail of 200 years, some groups had managed to maintain their connections with their land, usually because it was in a remote area and was so economically uninviting that no white person wanted it. Simple justice required that the law respect their rights, no less than it respects the rights of other Australians who have inherited land."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The editorial writer concluded:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"who really believes those Aborigines who can lay claim to an uninterrupted habitation of tribal land throughout 205 years of white settlement, not to mention the thousands of years before that, should not be allowed a form of secure title now?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly the experience of 170 years of North American jurisprudence should enable Australians to more rationally consider the implications of our common law finally catching up with international legal practice. Last year I had the opportunity to meet Canadian government and indigenous peoples representatives to find out more about the effect of "native title" recognition in that country which shares a social, cultural, legal and political heritage similar to Australia. The articulated position of a conservative Minister for Native Affairs, Tom Siddons, was remarkable then and is even more radical when contrasted with the hysterical rantings of conservative spokespeople throughout the current Mabo debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Former Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, in May this year said at the signing of the Nunavut Land Claim in the North West Territories:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"My Government has a dream&mdash;a vision of economic and social development in the North in which all Northerners participate, a vision in which territorial governments will continue to acquire more jurisdictional rights and responsibilities."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here then we have a conservative Prime Minister linking indigenous rights with economic development and looking forward to indigenous self-government! This policy position remains unchanged as the Canadian government, now boasting a woman leader, faces a general election later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A study comparing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indigenous Resource Rights and Mining Companies in North America and Australia</EMPHASIS> (McGill and Crough, 1986) highlights the different ways in which the international business community has responded to indigenous rights and native title.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Indian Act of 1876 is still the main instrument of Canadian Indian Policy (Johnson 1984:65). Its origins lie in a policy of assimilation and accordingly it still has a very paternalistic style. There have been demands for the replacement of the Act both at the time of the proposed termination of special Indian status in 1969 and in more recent years as a policy of self-determination has come to be accepted at Government level. . . </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the veto rights that are contained in the Indian Act, it is surprising to find that despite the assimilationist policy embodied in the broad powers and discretions conferred upon the Minister, the veto powers of Indian people are absolute. The basic mechanism of this veto power is contained in the idea that no development may occur unless the Indians voluntarily agree to surrender their land. Accordingly, the Act provides as follows&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`37.Except where this Act otherwise provides, lands in a reserve shall not be sold, alienated, leased or otherwise disposed of until they have been surrendered to Her Majesty by the band for whose use and benefit in common the reserve set apart.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, in the United States, the regulations made under the Indian Mineral Leasing Act are the starting point in a discussion of resource agreements on US Indian land.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">These regulations specify, among other things, the rents and royalties payable for mining and petroleum production on Indian land. As the legislative scheme follows the US practice of utilising competitive bidding, tribes may also receive the amount of any successful bid. In the case of tribal land, the relevant minimum royalty rates are 12.5% of the gross value of any petroleum (Section 211.12), approximately 10% of the value of other minerals, and 10 US cents per ton of coal (Section 211.15). However, these royalty rates are now largely of historical interest (particularly in the case of coal), as not only are higher royalties required to induce tribal consent, but also the 1938 Act has been supplemented by the 1982 Act."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously if the High Court ruling recognising "native title" is a threat to investment in Australia, one can only speculate about why the international business community has been able to accommodate "native title" in North America for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the problems for Australians adapting to the new reality of "native title" at common law is a general ignorance of Aboriginal culture and the experience of early contact between Aborigines and Europeans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many sections of the Australian community are unfamiliar with the national economic contribution made by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in developing our pastoral, mining and fishing industries. While critics continue to dismiss Aboriginal culture as "stone age", they are perpetuating the myth that only Anglo Saxon settlers were responsible for Australia's early development. However, even the most cursory study of the history 19th century European/Aboriginal relations will reveal the dependence of pioneers on indigenous peoples' local knowledge and skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was Aboriginal land use practice of fire-stick farming which created an open landscape facilitating rapid pastoral development in many parts of the country. Similarly, Aboriginal labour incorporating tracking skills made possible an open range pastoral industry which Europeans could not have initiated alone. Early explorers were reliant on the local  Aborigines who provided food, water, shelter, translation and diplomacy. They were in modern terms the unpaid "expert consultants".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to recall that the recently declared North West Queensland Mineral Province was actually first located in the 1870's by Ernest Henry whose Aboriginal guide led him to the mineral deposits of Cloncurry, Dajarra and Mount Isa. Therefore, it would not seem unreasonable for local Aboriginal communities today to participate in the economic activity of this region and to share some benefits of an expanded mining interest in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major challenge for governments and business interests as a result of the long overdue recognition of "native title" is to accept third party involvement in development so that Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders take their place at the negotiating table. Just as early settlers faced the reality of utilising indigenous skills to facilitate development in the 19th century, this generation of "developers" must accept the reality of working in genuine partnership with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, especially in remote areas of Northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mining, business and government leaders concerned about the impact of legal challenges in relation to the High Court's recognition of "native title" have the solution within their own power. They can accept indigenous people as having legitimate land and economic interests. They can negotiate with local indigenous communities. They can respect their leaders and accord them the same dignity and status as other business colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of mining companies already have responded to this obvious solution and their negotiated practice should be regarded as models for more conservative companies whose leaders continue to sit on the sidelines predicting national economic disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is every reason to be optimistic about future negotiations between the business and mining sector and indigenous "native title" owners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mount Todd near Katherine is just such an example where the Jawoyn Association has negotiated with Zapopan NL to reach an agreement suitable to both parties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 has created the enormous problem of a lack of certainty in the area of title to land. The only thing that is certain about the Mabo No. 2 decision is that the law has now become uncertain. The decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2 has raised the problem of sovereign risk for Australia. In effect, it made law, which is the province and function of this parliament. It has created problems which have to be remedied by  legislature, not by the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will begin by quoting the decision of Mr Justice Sir Anthony Mason in State Government Insurance Commission (SA) v. Trigwill in 1979. In this decision, Mr Justice Mason explains very adequately why courts cannot and should not make law. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not doubt that there are some cases in which an ultimate court of appeal can and should vary or modify what has been thought to be a settled rule or principle of the common law on the ground that it is ill-adapted to modern circumstances. If it should emerge that a specific common law rule was based on the existence of particular conditions or circumstances, whether social or economic, and that they have undergone a radical change, then in a simple or clear case the court may be justified in moulding the rule to meet the new conditions and circumstances. But there are very powerful reasons why the court should be reluctant to engage in such an exercise. The court is neither a legislature nor a law reform agency. Its responsibility is to decide cases by applying the law to the facts as found. The court's facilities, techniques and procedures are adapted to that responsibility; they are not adapted to legislative functions or to law reform activities. The court does not, and cannot, carry out investigations or inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether particular common law rules are working well, whether they are adjusted to the needs of the community and whether they command popular assent. Nor can the court call for, and examine, submissions from groups and individuals who may be vitally interested in the making of changes in the law. In short, the court cannot, and does not, engage in the wide-ranging inquiries and assessments which are made by governments and law reform agencies as a desirable, if not essential, preliminary to the enactment of legislation by an elected legislature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These considerations must deter a court from departing too readily from a settled rule of the common law and from replacing it with a new rule.</PARA>
<PARA>Very wise words indeed. I wonder what happened in the 10 years or so that intervened. In the judgment of Mabo No. 2 the High Court quite radically changed its mind on that principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to understand the difficulties and complexities that have been introduced into title law in this country we have to understand what the High Court found. Firstly, it said that sovereignty was obtained by the crown by 1788 and that that was an act of state and it was beyond the competence of the court to go behind. Secondly, it upheld the doctrine of tenure that we all hold from the crown. Thirdly, it upheld the Blackstone doctrine that Australia was a settled land and was neither ceded nor conquered. Fourthly, it held that title to land, ownership of land, was acquired by the crown at the time that sovereignty was acquired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up to that point nothing new had occurred. But at that point the High Court then made it up. It overturned all precedent, as it is entitled to do&mdash;it is the only court in the land which may&mdash;and said that ownership came in two bits: ownership consisted of radical title and beneficial title. It said that radical title was that title which the crown could exercise to extinguish the beneficial title which was in existence at the time of obtaining sovereignty and which has become known as native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is from that point on that the uncertainty has arisen. Because the High Court is the only court in the land which can overrule itself and is not bound by precedent, it could have done one of three things in the future with the existing Mabo No. 2 decision. Firstly, it could have overturned itself again and said that it got it wrong. There is plenty of precedent for that decision. We saw the overturning of all case law with regard to the interpretation of section 92 in the Cole and Whitfield case. Secondly, it could have said that it will distinguish any future case. It could have said that it will apply the ratio of the case in Mabo No. 2 only if the facts are similar&mdash;that is, if there is a defined area of land, Melanesian people, villages, gardens trading in surpluses from the gardens. Or it could have said that it will take the broad principles that emerge from the various pieces of obiter dicta&mdash;that is, all the things the judges had to say&mdash;create a broad principle and apply that. The only thing we can say with certainty is that nobody but nobody can tell us which way the court would have gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of Mabo No. 2, therefore, was precisely that until the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) chose to make his infamous Redfern speech. It was a speech made with all the prudence of a man driving along next to a tinder dry bushland and throwing in a match. It raised the expectations, it raised the hopes way past those which were reasonable. We confused from that point on the two questions of solving the uncertainty that arose from the High Court judgment of Mabo No. 2 and the most important principle of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing that needs to be done it is to keep the two things separate. The government's legislation as it is before this parliament confuses those two issues. It does nothing to solve the uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Uncertainty comes in two parts. Firstly, there is the uncertainty that the court may find against a person and one may find that a investment one has made is lost because of the court's finding. Secondly, there is the uncertainty that arises from the fact that claims may be made and an investment that one has made can be tied up in the courts for 10 years, just as the Mabo case was tied up in the courts for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what is known as sovereign risk. This country of ours has been free of sovereign risk and therefore we have been a very attractive destination for investment funds. As a nation, we have always been the net importers of capital. It has enabled us to develop our resources, to improve our standard of living and let all citizens share in that improved standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have been a safe destination and title has been certain, investment has come and the servicing of that investment has been reasonable in terms of the length of time that an investor expects for a return on that investment and also the amount of return expected. There are plenty of countries that have sovereign risk and we are now competing with them. They are countries in our own region. This occurs when an investment is not certain but the return expected and the shortness of time in which that return is expected is far greater than we have had to pay before. Empirical evidence is that firms which would have made investments and developments in Australia are simply not doing so. Within my files I have empirical evidence of precisely that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Australia is now suffering from sovereign risk. This legislation does absolutely nothing to solve that problem. It sets up competing jurisdictions and competing tribunals where the final outcome may not necessarily be the one that is accepted. It has executive function intervening. When we look at it and the 74 amendments that came in this morning from the government, one could be pardoned for saying that it makes the income tax act look simple. It is highly complex, it is highly obtuse and it is not good law. That is why the opposition is opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Richard Court's legislation is relatively simple. It is easy to comprehend. It means that by extinguishing, that is excising, that radical title all so-called beneficial title as pronounced by the High Court he has supplanted that with statutory recognition of rights which Aboriginal people presently enjoy. They do not have to go to a court to prove them. They were theirs as of right from the moment the legislation received assent. If anybody wants to deal or change those rights of usage that Aboriginal people have, compensation must be paid. It is straightforward. It is easy to comprehend and the people who enjoy the native statutory rights have those not because they have to go and fight before a tribunal and/or a court but because it has been enacted that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple truth is that when the opposition comes into office we will have to clean up the mess that this government has left behind. Because the Greens have acquiesced, succumbed, or whichever verb one chooses to use, to pressure that has been thrust upon them, this legislation will probably pass through this parliament. Nothing will be solved. The law will be more complex. The costs of investing in this country will be greater and, very simply, the investment will be less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other things that arise from the findings of Mabo&mdash;the finding in Mabo No. 1 and the implications for the Racial Discrimination Act. The 1975 legislation was tested in the early 1980s in Mabo No. 1 against legislation passed by the Queensland government. It could foresee some of the difficulties that might arise from the way in which the High Court may deal with the question of possessory title, for want of a better term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court held that the legislation passed in Queensland was invalid because it was struck down by the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975. That means that all leases, grants and alienations of land by the crown since that date are at risk and need to be validated. The reason they are clearly at risk is, in part, due to the fact that, under our constitution, where there is a compulsory or other acquisition of land, just terms must be paid. So that complication also has to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in relying as it does upon the convention from which the Racial Discrimination Act flows, is open to question itself. As we know, under that act, one may not discriminate against people on the basis of race, but in certain circumstances one may discriminate in favour of people on the basis of race. But that discrimination is qualified within the act itself and within the articles of the convention. It is far from certain that this legislation meets the criteria as laid down pursuant to those two instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So not only do we have legislation which does not solve the problem of sovereign risk, but also it is questionable as to whether or not it is within the power granted by the constitution for the legislation to be passed at all. That will be tested in the courts. Without putting too fine a point on it, as I said, what we will have is a highly complex mess which, when we come into office, we will have to clean up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the options that has to be looked at&mdash;and we have to see what the state of that mess is by the time we have an election&mdash;and an option that must remain open is what I call a dose of democracy: a referendum. I am not going to stand here tonight and be an instant draftsman, but I simply say that it is an option that must remain open and on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I oppose the bill because it in no way solves the problems as they have arisen from the decision of the High Court, which has become an adventuresome court. The High Court is not above criticism, nor should it be. The only way that judges can be accountable is through criticism and discussion. The question of reconciliation must not be confused with this question of solving the uncertainties that result from that decision of the High Court. I would like to say a word about that. To me, reconciliation is one of most important items that can be on the agenda between now and the next century. To me, it means building respect between indigenous Australians and those of us who have come more latterly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to give a little example. Fairly recently I bought a painting in Darwin. It is a painting by an Aboriginal artist called Mary Kannyi. She is 68 years old and she has been painting for only two years. She has been painting for only two years because in traditional Aboriginal society it is the men who are allowed to paint, not the women. But more and more women are taking up the talent that they have and taking the knowledge that they have of their environment&mdash;the beauty of the flowering desert, the waterholes and the plants that are used for medicine&mdash;and are expressing it in an artistic form. They want to share the knowledge that they have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mary Kannyi lives at Daly River. She has lived there all her life by the billabong. I respect her knowledge; I respect her talent; I respect the fact that she wants to share both her knowledge and her talent. In return I want to see us share things with Mary Kannyi and other Aboriginal people. But I do not want it imposed in a paternalistic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, education and medicine are two areas where it is essential that there is a sharing, but merely to impose it upon a culture and say, `Here, take this and use it in the way we tell you' is not done with respect and it will not benefit those people who clearly need that knowledge. Fairly recently, one of the Boyer lectures was given by an Aboriginal doctor. He explained very well why there needs to be a change in attitude to the way in which I have said knowledge is to shared. The building of respect is key to reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I met Oodgeroo Noonuccal on one only occasion and that was at the Expo in Brisbane. I would disagree with her on almost every political point, but I admired her enormously. She was a woman who had taken her talent and exercised her will. She had reached a position in her society which would have been banned to her before as a woman. She stood for saying, `My people are entitled to respect'. I can only say she earned mine. That is why I say that reconciliation is a vital issue and must not be mixed up with the solution to the problems created by the High Court in Mabo No.2. This legislation offends on both counts: it confuses the issues and solves nothing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that must be made again and again is that, because of the Mabo decision, people may have vested rights in land. Whatever is done about that affects their rights in that land. This is not a matter where we say, `Look, the court has made a decision. It's not a bad sort of a day today. After all, we've got to feel generous towards a certain group of people; therefore, we'll give them the rights that we feel they ought to be given&mdash;not the rights that are declared by the High Court and not the rights that six of the seven judges so solemnly pronounced that they had, but some rights that we will determine in some way they should have'. That is a very dangerous, radical and revolutionary approach to take to the established structures under which we live. The constitution  that contains those sacred institutions must not be violated in the way that has been referred to today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I want to make some further points. Australian mining companies have a good case for being given security of title over the sites in which they are working. Pastoralists have a good case for being given safe tenure over their holdings. Fishing interests have a good case for being guaranteed access to relevant waters. The forestry industry has a good case for having its due entitlement protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those Aboriginal Australians&mdash;all of whom must, by dint of the judgment of the High Court have Aboriginal ancestry&mdash;who have title to the land under the Mabo decision have a good case for that to be preserved. All those groups of people I have mentioned have rights, but if all exercised those rights to their utmost limit there would be awful tension. So, as everybody has concluded, there has to be legislation to overcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that the legislation fails to be perfect. That is absolutely true. Of course it fails to be perfect. It cannot be perfect, given the number of rights that people of different groups allege and assert they have over the same piece of land. That is what this legislation does.

In the pursuit of perfection, perhaps, the good that might be otherwise done in legislation such as the government has put forward is lost, and lost tragically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any issue over land is going to raise problems and generate high emotion. That has been the case with the land law that we enjoy, which has come from the land law of England, with all the sorts of different rights that were enjoyed in that land. The history of that land law has been full of strife and stress. Even in Australia, there were the fights between the emancipists and the exclusivists and the difference between the view Commissioner Bigge took in his attitude to the emancipists and the view taken by Lachlan Macquarie is an example. The fight between selectors and squatters was much the same. But people went ahead and legislated. The famous Charles Gavan Duffy, from the country you used to grace, Mr Acting Deputy President, passed the laws in Victoria in the 1860s which led to the settlement of the problems down there. Some sort of action had to be taken, and he took good action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing has been done here with the Mabo legislation. It is a not a unique incident in the history of land law. It is in many ways typical of what happened before Mabo. It was not until 1677, I think&mdash;certainly Senator Vanstone will help me here&mdash;with the enactment of the Statute of Frauds that the conveyance of land had to be in writing. In the centuries before, not enough people were literate to put the transactions involving land into writing. So it was in a general way the same sort of system that operated, as far as we can gather, amongst the Aboriginals before 1788. In other words, the common law, in picking up native title, is picking up something that is not as unique and as strange as people might think. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like everybody else, I could say a lot more but I want to conclude by saying this: this legislation has been brought forward because it needs to be brought forward and needs to be brought forward expeditiously. People, whether they are miners or pastoralists, want certainty of title. Australian citizens of Aboriginal background, who have a claim under Mabo to land, want that matter resolved as soon as possible. I would have thought that this legislation could have been used as a basis for such amendments as people might want to make and can agree upon. But simply to throw it out holus-bolus without even having an alternative to put in its place is a stance which cannot be helpful at this time in the development of our land law. It is important that this legislation go through with the proper amendments. </PARA>

There has been no mention from the government of the costs and the benefits associated with the legislation. The bill proposes to greatly increase land options for a small proportion of the Aboriginal population. Land is important for the Aborigines, but it is also important for the economic and social wellbeing of all Australians. In that regard, let me quote the words of an 18th century American Red Indian chief:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>All Australians, whether their ancestors arrived 40,000 years ago from Asia, whether they arrived 200 years ago from Europe, or whether they arrived yesterday, should feel proud and privileged to have their ancient links with the past in our land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As something so important for Aborigines and for all Australians, and when the constitution clearly leaves land management to the states in our federal system, the bill before us should have the agreement of the states. As one of the state premiers said following the breakup of the heads of government meeting, negotiations should have continued over a complete weekend in order to get resolution on this matter. However, our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) presented the states with a take it or leave it position. As a result, cooperation went out the window. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many months ago the government made a political decision to go along the path of dealing with the Australian Democrats and the Greens. Basically, it said, `To hell with the states and to hell with industry'. Today we have a bill which most of the states agree has major problems attached to it. We should remember again that it is the states who have to manage the land. Our most important export and development industry&mdash;the mining and mineral processing industry&mdash;has been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I will concentrate on the implications of this bill for the Australian economy, and hence for all Australians. We need strong economic growth to give hope to the unemployed and to offer material help to disadvantaged Australians. To achieve this we need increased investment and increased exports. Whilst all our industry sectors are important, I would like to concentrate on the mining industry, which I believe will be the industry most seriously affected by this legislation. This industry currently contributes seven per cent of our nation's GDP. It contributes 25 per cent of our nation's exports. Last year it contributed 24 per cent of all the investment by the private sector in the economy. This is investment which we are trying to build to get this economy going again. This bill puts that quarter at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For continued economic growth of our resource based industries and for continuing mining investment for these industries, we need appropriate property rights and economic incentives. Property rights must be clearly defined and stable. Uncertainty about property rights leads to economic losses. Contrary to the traditional views of economists who have always relied upon interest rates, incentives, tax rates, et cetera, to provide a major explanation of the investment cycle, there is now a strong view that the major determinant for investment is confidence and security. The greater the uncertainty, the lower the investment. I have stressed in this place many times that the level of private sector investment in this country is the lowest it has been since World War II. We need to boost investment to create sustained economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view of the business community is that the most urgent task post-Mabo is the removal of uncertainty in relation to property rights. In addition, economic incentives are needed to encourage people to respond. The Industry Commission, in its report in 1991 on the mining and mineral processing industry, said that following the Aboriginal land rights experience in the Northern Territory&mdash;a matter about which I will comment more later&mdash;the most appropriate system was one in which either Aborigines had full property rights to minerals as well as land or they had no rights to minerals at all. A half-way house destroys all incentive to make the most economic use of those resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory situation provides some sort of example of what could happen with a prohibitive mining policy, such as is possible under this bill. In the Northern Territory the traditional system of crown ownership of mineral resources was replaced in 1976 with a system of Aboriginal rights under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. The act initially gave the Aboriginal owners a two-stage veto over exploration and subsequent mining. Because of the difficulties involved in such a system, the act was amended in 1987 to permit the veto only at the exploration stage. The evidence suggests that the implications of this system have been devastating for the mining industry in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even following the 1987 amendments, there was an average of only five exploration licences per year processed on Aboriginal land compared with 150 received, processed and granted on non-Aboriginal land in the territory. By comparing mining licence outcomes on Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal land, it can be estimated that some 3,000 exploration licences that would otherwise have been taken out over the past 20 years have not been pursued in that region. On the basis of average success rates, this has probably meant that three mines have failed to come to fruition in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 Industry Commission report on that industry that I referred to earlier found that there was a general dissatisfaction with the aboriginal land rights act in the Northern Territory. In spite of the findings of that inquiry, no substantial changes have been made to that act and many of its features are evident in the Native Title Bill. As one respected commentator put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The history of land rights in the Northern Territory has been that of 20 years of lost opportunity. The mining companies, the Australian community in general, and the Aboriginals in particular, are clear losers from unnecessary impediments and delays. The lessons from the Northern Territory experience are clear. Where unwieldy negotiation and veto processes are allowed to overlay a system of tradeable property rights, the impact on costs and consequent investment is stifling.</PARA>
<PARA>The attitude of prospective mineral exploration companies is just as important as the actual physical barriers they face in gaining security of mineral rights and access to land. In Tasmania, for example, a succession of attempts by the radical conservation movement in the early 1980s resulted in significant downturns in prospective mineral exploration investment. This phenomenon verifies much of the earlier argument about economic certainty being a very important determinant of investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Tasmania, exploration investment expenditure fell from $18 million in 1983-84 to only $8 million in 1992-93&mdash;a decline of 56 per cent. That decline, started by the creation of uncertainty about access to or tenure of potential mining areas that were the subject of argument as to usage, was further exacerbated by the election of a Labor-Green government in the latter part of the 1980s. The ongoing uncertainty and insecurity in the business community, particularly in the mining sector, virtually brought to a halt investment in exploration in my state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining rights in the Northern Territory are currently based on a system with a negotiation phase, followed by a land council phase, with the land council having a yes or no say on each application. There is also an arbitration system which exists to determine the necessary terms and conditions if land council approval is given. This arbitration system has never been used. The current Native Title Bill also provides for a negotiation phase. But in this case it is the appropriate tribunal which will have the yes or no say and which will also establish the terms and conditions. Thus, the outcome in each of the cases brought before it will depend on the workings of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look around as to what experience there has been in Australia to gain some insight as to how tribunals are likely to work. One good example is the case of Coronation Hill. This development was considered contentious on environmental grounds at the time, largely because there was a federal election coming up. The matter was passed to the Resource Assessment Commission, headed by a judge with appropriate experts. We should note the similarities that are proposed in this bill. It carried out a 12-month study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subsequent report found that there was no environmental problem with the mining of Coronation Hill. However, issues relating to Aboriginals' spiritual matters were raised with the Resource Assessment Commission, which recommended against mining at this site. It is no wonder the mining industry is worried about this bill. Such an approval process could, in effect, turn out to be a de facto veto process. Furthermore, the economic incentives are wrong. The Commonwealth has set a limit on compensation for disturbance on the basis of state compensation schemes. There is little incentive for native titleholders to negotiate. In reality, therefore, it would probably pay them to push for a veto of mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitudes, arguments and concerns of the mining industry have been clearly put to the recent hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Mr Jerry Ellis from BHP Minerals argued, firstly, that the question of the validity of existing mining leases has not been totally clarified and, secondly, that the major issue is that the procedures put in place by the bill would be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . time consuming&mdash;unnecessarily so in our view&mdash;and sometimes so time consuming that we believe market opportunities will be lost.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Mr de Crespigney from Normandy Poseidon argued that the bill is too complex, it is unworkable, and the tribunal procedures are neither fair nor practical. I quote two important passages from Mr de Crespigney's submission to the Senate committee. First, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having fulfilled that urgent need&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to tackle the Mabo challenge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">except in relation to the validation of existing titles, urgency ceases to be a requirement, and the point I cannot stress enough is that we are in a marathon, not a sprint, and all parties interested in reconciliation should now carefully, diligently, dispassionately and not hurriedly, review and address the whole reconciliation challenge, of which land is but one.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill in its present form, particularly because of the significant delays it will create, will completely fetter our ability to provide wealth for our shareholders, taxes for the nation and employment opportunities generally, but in particular for Aborigines. Obviously, if it will have that effect on Normandy Poseidon, just imagine the impact on national wealth and national job opportunities if the BHPs and CRAs and the Western Minings are all having the same problems. Remember, lost opportunities means lost jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will be aware that CRA announced on Monday of this week that it is reducing its level of exploration in Australia by a further 10 per cent and will be investing overseas instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, there is no hurry with this bill&mdash;it is a marathon. This is a very serious matter for all Australians, and it is imperative that we, as parliamentarians, get it right for all Australians, for all Aborigines. I oppose the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As quickly as I can, I will put those issues to the Senate. Of course, there is the crucial issue of the plight of Australian Aboriginals, particularly those who are suffering most&mdash;those who live in abject poverty, those who miss out when it comes to health care, educational opportunities, access to land, housing and the many opportunities that most of us, who live in a privileged part of Australian society have access to. By `privileged' I mean anyone who has a suit of clothes, a roof over their heads, access to education, and a family environment. I call that privileged because there are so many Australians who do not share that privilege&mdash;and many Aboriginals simply do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those issues are vital issues for Australia. I do not think anyone in this chamber or any Australians, no matter what their views on Aboriginal issues may be or are perceived to be, would dispute the fact that all Australians would like to see the welfare and opportunities for Aboriginal or indigenous Australians increased. Of course, it has been debated for decades as to how best achieve that. I am extremely sceptical about the approach that we have taken in the last 10 to 15 years&mdash;or at least those years that I have been cognisant of political debate&mdash;to the debate about Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further issue is the control of land and whether that should be carried out by state governments, as has been the case since and before federation. That, of course, is a crucial issue. It is an issue that has been canvassed in the Senate, and shortly I will just canvass it a little more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the issues which have dominated the debate are security of land title and the economic debate and the issues of sovereign risk and individual property rights, which are crucial to economic development and the fabric of our society, were particularly well canvassed by my colleague Senator Bishop. People do need to have some sense of belonging and certainty in relation to their own economic future&mdash;and that applies, of course, equally to all Australians. Of course, people from different backgrounds may put different emphases on the form of land title they hold. But amongst all human beings there is an essential feeling that we need a place to call home. Of course, some nomadic human beings on this earth may have a different sense of being when it comes to land, and that is something that we need to understand as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other crucial issue, which has made this a very hot political debate, a very important political debate, a divisive one, relates to Australia's economic future. But division is not all bad because it can bring out the best and worst in our society. At least if we have an active public debate on these issues, it involves the community and gets people thinking about bigger issues than their day to day woes&mdash;and that is perhaps a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic development is a crucial part of this debate. Whenever Australia's economic future is put at risk, be it by this sort of legislation or by industrial relations legislation, taxation legislation, health legislation&mdash;any sort of legislation that may impinge on Australia's economic development&mdash;the debate becomes heated, emotional and involves a lot of vested interests and, more often than not, the interests of those who are most affected are sometimes ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current climate in Australia, in 1993, one of those interests is that of the army of unemployed and underemployed people. They are an extremely underprivileged group in Australia because they get up in the morning, see their friends and relatives going off to work and they wonder when the hell they will have the opportunity to do so themselves, to forge their own economic security in the world and to have self-esteem. So economic development is not only crucial for the security and future of all Australians; I am sure it is also a matter of genuine concern to all senators on all sides of the chamber&mdash;no matter how many political points we might want to score in the economic and unemployment debate&mdash;and all members of this parliament in trying to solve the unemployment crisis. This, again, has made the so-called Mabo debate a highly emotional and highly important debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue is that of race, which many people do not like to bring out, but a piece of legislation like this which will create a form of title which will only be available to one race of people naturally inflames debate over race generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though I am happy to accept that the Mabo ruling exists and that we need to understand that it is reality, my opposition to it in the first place is that where we divide Australia on the basis that there will be various systems of titles throughout the states which are available to all Australians, regardless of their ethnic background, race or colour, and then create a form of title that will be available to only one race of people who have black skin, of course we inflame tensions within society, which none of us enjoy. One needs to address that. My fundamental starting point in this debate is that once we divide Australia by setting up a system of land titles based on race, we can set up as many councils for reconciliation as we could want, but it will create tensions within a society which no Commonwealth or state government or highly motivated politician will ever solve. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has been described by Senator Reynolds as a most important bill. I have been here for only just over three years and I have come across a number of debates where the bills have been described as the most important ever to come before this chamber, but there is absolutely no doubt that this bill is a crucial one. I shall never fall into the trap of calling a bill the most important one to come before this chamber because we never know when Mabo will come around the corner again. This bill is important because it changes some fundamental aspects of Australian society. One of the most crucial changes will be to the entire land management system. It will have crucial effects on the security of title, which Senator Bishop and my colleagues have already referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the saddest aspects of this bill is the corporatist approach which has been adopted in solving the problem. It does not take any cognisance of individual Australians, be they indigenous Australians or other Australians. It has gone through the normal Labor Party-Paul Keating approach to solving a problem; that is, pull in a few heads of a few groups&mdash;be it trade unions, Aboriginal groups, industry, state governments, whatever&mdash;and put together a deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has put together a deal in the process of coming to this lowest common denominator so-called solution to the so-called Mabo problem which I know that even my Green colleagues from Western Australia doubt is a solution. In fact, just about every honourable senator who has made a contribution, including Senator Cooney and my former colleague Fred Chaney in Western Australia, has said, `This is far from perfect but, gee whiz, we have to rush it through, because if we do not get it through, it will be worse and there will be these nasty political campaigns which will hurt Aboriginals'. That may or may not be true, but what is very worrying about this is the corporatist approach that has been taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My friend and colleague Senator Ellison described one of the other corporatist aspects of this bill&mdash;that native title under this bill will not be vested in individuals or communities; it will be invested in some sort of corporate body. I think one of the most crucial things that we can do to reconcile Aboriginals and the rest of the Australian community is to ensure that wherever possible, and as far as possible, the rights and responsibilities of Australian citizens are equal, regardless of one's ethnic background, where one was born or the colour of one's skin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By creating a set of titles which can only be vested in some sort of corporate entity and another set of titles which can be vested in an individual or another corporate entity, we are creating more separatism; we are dividing this nation even more on race.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to control of land and states rights, honourable senators on both sides of this chamber, including my Western Australian colleague Senator Chris Evans, from the Labor Party, have said that they believe in individual rights and not states rights. Of course, the Liberal commitment to a federal system is based on keeping government close to the people. Land and land management have been controlled by state governments before and since Federation. The value of that is that management of land&mdash;the issuance of titles, control of land, licences to mine or conduct other activities&mdash;requires day-to-day management. It must, just in a practical sense, be managed as close to the ground as possible. That is the value of our Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no intrinsic faith in state governments. I have little faith in governments as a solution to woes or problems at all. But if one has to choose a government to try to create an environment where people can maximise their own liberty and freedom, it is better to have that government as close to the people as possible. So if that government infringes on people's liberties, at the next election the people can pass their democratic judgment on that government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, the people of Australia and the people of Western Australia will cast judgment on the decision this parliament and the Senate is making to grab control of land management from state governments. It is interesting to note the responses to research conducted by the Roy Morgan Research Centre last week, 8 December 1993. Western Australians were asked, `In your opinion, should the federal government's Mabo legislation be allowed to overrule the WA state government's Mabo legislation or not?'. Sixty-six per cent of people agreed that the state government should not be overruled and only 27 agreed with Mr Keating's proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to my friend and colleague, Senator Teague, that this is something akin to a more substantial result than that achieved as a result of the fantastic effort in the South Australia state election, described across Australia as a landslide. I am trying to give the Senate an understanding of the strength of feeling in Western Australia, the state from which I come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixty-six per cent of Western Australians answered yes to the question, `Would you support a request to the High Court to determine which Mabo legislation should deal with the Mabo problem?'. On the other crucial question, `In your opinion, which government's Mabo legislation should the High Court rule in favour of, the federal government's or the state government's?', 60 per cent of Western Australians supported the Western Australian state government approach and only 25 per cent supported the approach of the federal government, which is, of course, to control it all from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous distrust of this federal government, particularly in states like South Australia and Western Australia. We do not trust the federal government and we generally do not trust decisions being made 3,000 miles away from where they will take effect. The opinion of the Western Australian population, reflected in the Roy Morgan survey, is indicative of that. I repeat that that is an even stronger opinion than that passed on the South Australian state Labor government only a few days ago when South Australians ejected the Labor Party from government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only a minute left in which to speak and I have many more points that I would like to make.

I thought it incredibly hypocritical that Senator Chamarette should have had to seek an extension of her speaking time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that I might mention in closing is that it was Senator Chamarette who put before this Senate a notice of motion that basically said that, when the Mabo legislation came before this chamber, she would move a motion to suspend standing orders to allow a delegation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives to appear before the bar of the Senate. She was so determined to ensure that this legislation got a full and fair hearing that she was prepared to move that motion. But when the opportunity came to ensure that the legislation got a full and fair hearing through a proper select committee process, she decided not to do that. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be brief in my remarks. I listened most carefully to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, and I commend every word of his speech. In my view, he very aptly summarised the position of the opposition. He talked about the current international debate with regard to land law, of the move away from any notion of terra nullius in various countries around the world and his acceptance, reflecting the views of the opposition, of the High Court's parallel decision on this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to refer to the speech of a new senator, and increasingly my friend, Senator Chris Ellison. His technical grasp of this bill, of the Senate committee inquiry, of which he was a prominent member, and of the consultations that have taken place in regard to this bill were very aptly summarised in his speech. I have much to learn from his contribution with regard to some technical elements of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard a majority of the speeches, mostly when I was out of the chamber and in my office. I wish to refer to two of them. Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia&mdash;another new senator&mdash;was the first speaker from the Labor Party. I think he summarised the Labor Party's approach to this matter very honourably. I disagree with his conclusion, I disagree with a number of his arguments and assessments, but it was clear from his speech that he was sincere and that he had thought through his own approach to this bill. I regard his views as typical of those expressed by the present Labor government. He was very fulsome in his support of the Prime Minister&mdash;it is not surprising that a new Labor senator would speak in this way about the Labor Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Cheryl Kernot, gave a very considered, carefully prepared, speech in which she put forward the strong commitment to justice for all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, that she has expressed over recent months as a member of the reconciliation commission. I have had discussions with her in past months and many of us in the opposition would express in similar ways much of her commitment for justice for the Aboriginal people. I disagree with Senator Kernot's final assessments with regard to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been in fact quite divisive. This divisiveness has been expressed to a greater extent in the speeches that were made in the House of Representatives and in the Senate than in the four contributions that I have specifically mentioned. There has been divisiveness in the way the press has handled this issue over the last six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it has been divisive chiefly because of the inherent uncertainty that flows from the High Court's Mabo decision. When there have been various alternative approaches to try to limit that uncertainty and when there have been differences of assessment as to the right pathway to limit the uncertainty, we have seen division grow in the debate and in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All sorts of wild statements have been made by the government that it actually did have a solution that was going to work. This is so manifestly not true that it leads to a huge reaction by those who have current real interests in this country of ours, such as those with a rightful and lawful use of land in the form of such things as pastoral leases and mining leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Prime Minister in his failure to consult sufficiently with representatives of these groups has by his very isolation not solved this growing sense of division. We now have a sincere senator like Senator Chris Evans saying that we should not delay this debate because there is a fragile consensus that the Prime Minister has put together and that, if it were to be put off even until next week, let alone next year, that fragile consensus would evaporate, the bill would fail and maybe no solution would emerge. I do not agree with Senator Chris Evans's assessment. On the other side, we have had a very credible response from many in the opposition, and some in the minority parties, that this legislation has been put together without a convincing legal foundation and so unprofessionally that it is going to fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference has been made by many honourable senators in the debate to the approximately 200 amendments that we will be debating in the committee stage, presumably tomorrow. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in front of us a bill, the Native Title Bill 1993, and yet introduced only today were government amendments, totalling 75 or thereabouts, as well as about 50 amendments from the Greens and about 50 amendments from the Democrats. We are supposed to have some confidence that after a committee stage, with up to 200 amendments&mdash;carefully assessing which word, which clause, which phrase, which approach and which legal vocabulary&mdash;we will eventually end up with a workable bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this is not a reliable way for this Senate to determine legislation that will serve Australia well over the middle and longer term. It will not even serve us well over the short term. So we have this division of opinion. I hear a sincere and fluent senator from the Labor Party such as Senator Chris Evans and I disagree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually it will come down to the numbers in the Senate. It is haphazard at the moment because we do not know what will happen to the amendments from the Green senators or the amendments from the Democrats. We in the opposition are so lacking in confidence about this legislation, so opposed to some key elements within it, that we are not interested in trying to find a set of amendments that would satisfy it. It is genuinely the opposition's view that this whole bill should be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me reaffirm a number of principles that I believe are typical of the approach to native title not only of the opposition but also of many other senators, despite this difference of opinion about this legislation&mdash;legislation that the government wants adopted and legislation that the opposition seeks to reject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some principles and objectives that are pretty common to all of us. Firstly, we accept native title, we accept the legitimacy of the High Court to have made that determination, and we accept the High Court's decision. Many advances have been made in common law over the last several centuries in the tradition of British common law, including Australian common law. Some of our real advances in the rights of people and individuals have been won through a common law approach by enactments in courts such as the High Court. I accept the High Court's decision. I have looked at it in detail. If I had been on the bench, I believe I would have come down with a similar conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had quite an unusual conjunction of circumstances in Murray Island, in the Torres Strait. We had a succession of ownership from ancestor to inheritor in a long, unbroken line. That inherited land was actually in the possession of the heirs and there was no other title issued with regard to it. So we had traditional owners actually occupying traditional land and no other title having been given in respect of that land. It is my view that the High Court made the right decision in awarding that land, with the concept of native title, to those owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not there is any other community, or more than a few or more than a handful of communities, amongst the Aboriginal population of Australia which has the same conjunction of characteristics as those in Murray Island is still to be tested. For example, in my own state of South Australia, those that come nearest to that conjunction of circumstances have already been given title to land by statute law. I refer to the Pitjantjatjara people. I was present when the Pitjantjatjara land title was handed over by my friend David Tonkin, then Premier of South Australia, in a ceremony in a creek bed near Ernabella. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle is the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not believe anybody wants to abrogate that act or its principles. We do not wish to see racial discrimination in Australia. Thirdly, I subscribe&mdash;and I believe most of us do&mdash;to one Australia, with one law for all. That should not be taken to mean that there is an overlooking of any particular right of a particular group of Australians that is a part of the one law of Australia. I see native title as being an appropriate law, or appropriate ownership of land, for a particular people and as a part of the overall one law of Australia. Fourthly, I believe that there must be just recognition of Aboriginal land interests. I believe that most Australians, and most members of this chamber, in all parties, recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fifth point concerns the principle that where land is denied to owners, there is just compensation. Sixthly, I believe that until December 1993 such compensation arising with regard to native title should be met by the government rather than by those who had lawful possession of the land prior to this issue arising, whether by freehold or even by lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final principle that I refer to is the practical one of trying to limit uncertainty for investment in Australia&mdash;investment that generates wealth for Australia, jobs for Australians, and mineral, pastoral, forest and fishing products. The whole reason for this debate and for this bill is to try to weigh the impact of the High Court's decision with regard to native title and then, by statute, to limit the uncertainty that various implications of that decision would have for various industries and various users of land in Australia. Why then, in the last few minutes available to me in this debate, do I reject this bill and why indeed does the opposition reject the bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I really do believe that the bill leads to more uncertainty, not less. It certainly involves uncertainty for pastoral leaseholders and mining leaseholders in Australia when we&mdash;especially those of us who fully accept the High Court's decision&mdash;should have been intent from the beginning to map out how to limit to the maximum extent and to a just extent this degree of uncertainty. Miners, farmers, foresters, fishers and anyone else with a legitimate use of land should not have to be anxious. They should be able to follow through with their investment or with their own work to the fullest extent in the confidence that they have the same access to land that they had two years ago, 10 years ago and 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we reject this bill because it compounds the uncertainty that I have just referred to by a complex system of tribunals to determine any claims. This will inevitably lead to lengthy and complex litigation&mdash;to more uncertainty. I defy anyone in the chamber to say that there is a simple line as to what is, by this bill, made more certain and how we can see the limits of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, this bill trespasses on native titleholders. It projects land ownership in the name of Aboriginal people by way of certain corporations, certain groupings of Aboriginals, which are not necessarily the native titleholders. I believe that, should this bill be passed, there will be disputes between native titleholders and various Aboriginal corporations or entities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, this bill trespasses on the Australian constitution's apportioning responsibility for land matters to the states. The uncertainty is serious because it affects us all. It jeopardises investment in pastoral industries, mining, fishing and forestry. It diverts economic activity away from Australia. It increases the fears and anxieties of Australians and divides Australians from one another. I reject the bill because it increases the uncertainty of the question of native title in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike Senator Teague, I have deliberately not listened to anyone's speech on the Native Title Bill, because I wanted to say what I wanted to say and not get involved or be tempted to get involved in responding to other people. For a number of reasons, I am opposed to Prime Minister Keating's response to the High Court decision.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I believe that it increases the uncertainty of that decision and, secondly, I believe that it has caused an enormous amount of fear and concern amongst Aborigines and other members out in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key problems with this legislation, apart from its complexity, is that it expands the High Court decision far beyond that which was brought down. A situation will be created where this legislation is challenged in the courts. There will be court cases on all aspects of it. It will become a battle of the lawyers. We know before we start that it will be the lawyers who finally determine what all of this legislation really means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is flawed because it will cause conflict. Its very complexity will ensure that. In Western Australia&mdash;most of my speech relates to Western Australia and the concerns which exist there&mdash;there will be conflict between the Aborigines who live in the south-west of the state and the urban areas, those who live in the pastoral areas and those who are still involved where crown land exists. In Western Australia, something like 80 per cent of the state is crown land and pastoral land combined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will cause conflict between Aborigines and the rest of the community, between Aborigines and miners and between Aborigines and pastoralists. The legislation does not properly address those problems. It does not work through in the best and most comprehensive way, I believe, the handling of those problems. I have already mentioned court cases. Not only will there be court cases over the claims but there will be a number of challenges to this legislation in the High Court. A lot of that will be brought about purely and simply because the consultation process between the states has not been satisfactory. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and those on the other side of this chamber will regret the isolation of Western Australia in that consultative process long into the future. I will say a little more about that in a moment or two. </PARA>

That will have a huge impact on the total structure and fabric of Australian life. But the area where it will hurt most is in the jobs that the mining industry generates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Burns can laugh all he likes, but it might even destroy it. We have heard comments from Mr Keating, Mr Walker and Mr Tickner to the effect that Western Australia had nothing to worry about with the Commonwealth's approach because it would not have a large impact on that state. However, some time later Mr Keating came to Western Australia and he was questioned by journalists. One article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> of 10 October 1993&mdash;I will hold it up for all to see&mdash;had the headline `Prime Minister admits WA has a lot to lose with Mabo'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolute tragedy that the Prime Minister of this nation was not prepared to effectively address the legitimate concerns of Western Australia. It is obvious from the Prime Minister's statement that WA is the state that will be most affected by this legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy for Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania to go down the route that this legislation puts before us.

Of all the Aborigines in Western Australia to whom I have spoken&mdash;obviously, I have not spoken to them all&mdash;not one of them has told me that he or she supports this legislation. I want to put that comment on the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of land system allocations, usages and access, I believe that Western Australia has the best record of all the states. I say that for a number of reasons which I will briefly go through. First of all&mdash;and Senator Teague gave an example in relation to South Australia&mdash;14 per cent, or approximately 325,000 square kilometres, is now held in various forms of titles relating to the Aboriginal people. We have legislation to cover sacred sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put in place a program of buying stations&mdash;I think it was in 1985 or thereabouts, certainly in the 1980s&mdash;and now 39 stations out of the 400 leases, that is approximately 10 per cent, are owned and run by Aboriginal people. I emphasise that point&mdash;owned and run. Like other stations in Western Australia, there are good ones, there are not so good ones, and there are some that need some help. I again point out that those particular people are frightened out of their wits by this legislation. They are very concerned that they are going to find themselves locked into court battles. On top of that, we have excision legislation. I think there are now 33 excisions or thereabouts in terms of that particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that I want to make in terms of that and the traditional usage, which exists in Western Australia and goes back to the days of Lord Forrest, is that there has been a statutory right for land usage on virtually all pastoral land in Western Australia. There are similar situations in the Northern Territory and in South Australia, but not to any degree, if any, in the other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that I wish to raise deals with the constitutional problems of this bill. It will be challenged on a number of grounds in the High Court. To give one example, it will be challenged on the fact that it interferes with the constitutional right of the states as far as land management is concerned. If this legislation is passed, it will totally rewrite the statute books in regard to the management and allocation of land in Australia. That will mean, as I have already said, long and lengthy legal debate and battle. The validity of this legislation will be in doubt for years and years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point that I want to raise relates to the role that the National Farmers Federation, particularly Rick Farley, has played in this matter. I have to say that I found very offensive a letter that appeared on my desk today addressed to Dr Hewson. I found it offensive in two ways: firstly, as to the accusation contained therein, which I will deal with in a moment; and, secondly, in that the letter was written to Dr Hewson requesting some assistance in terms of a particular aspect and that the letter was circulated low, high and wide. The author of the letter has done it purely and simply because of the things that he has consistently been saying. In my view, he has totally misled the pastoralists and the farmers or the member organisations of this nation for months and months. He suddenly discovered that what he was saying was not correct. I must make the record absolutely clear and say that the letter was signed by the President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Graham Blight, and not by Mr Farley. But I have no doubt who was the author of the letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read the answer to a question that I put to Senator Gareth Evans, who was with us in the chamber a minute ago, on 20 October 1993. I will not read the whole answer because it is on the public record. Part of that answer stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether they have been extinguished absolutely or whether they have been extinguished to the extent of any inconsistency is an issue that remains to be determined by the High Court. That is the language that some of the judges used&mdash;`to the extent of any inconsistency'.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time many of us made it quite clear to the NFF that there was an enormous amount of doubt about whether or not pastoral leases were actually validated. There is a significant difference between validated and valid. That point was not listened to. We see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of 6 December that Mr Farley stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view and on our legal advice, the bill will provide security of tenure for pastoral leaseholders. The bill provides that any lease which is found to be invalid at any time, provided that lease was issued before 31 December 1993&mdash;any invalid lease issued before that time&mdash;will be validated and the act of validation will extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA>I apologise to Senator Vanstone because she has heard all this before. Later in the proceedings he was questioned by Senator O'Chee. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How do you see clause 214 being in any way different from 213, given that 214 presumes that the leasehold in question is already a past act?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Farley</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Let me make the point that the legislation, as it exists, deals only with the validation of those acts which are previously found to be invalid. The legal advice we have received in relation to the valid grant of particular leases is that the valid grant of a lease has extinguished native title. In the absence of native title, the renewal of a valid lease should not be open to question.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we have before us this letter. What this letter tries to do is put the blame back on the coalition if this matter is not dealt with. I said to Mr Farley of the NFF going back many months that there is a serious problem. The pastoralists must lay the blame for any problems they have with this legislation fairly and squarely at the feet of Mr Farley. By not telling the whole story he has created an enormous inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my remarks by stating a couple of points. I firmly believe that the reconciliation process must be kept separate from the Native Title Bill. I think we will confuse a lot of issues if we put these issues together. I also want to ask a question in terms of the reconciliation process because I have some problems with it. I raised this matter in the press some time ago. Why, in Western Australia under the administration of ATSIC, was $8 million out of $50 million allocated last year for housing not used? Why was it returned to the central system when 1,300 Aboriginal families were looking for housing in Western Australia? I think that is something that needs addressing very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation may give about 12,000 Aborigines native title but what about the rest of the Aborigines? This legislation is divisive and it discriminates against Western Australia. The elders I have spoken to in Western Australia do not want this legislation. I will not support legislation that is unfair and unjust. Australia is one nation and I wish it to remain that way. </PARA>

The library officer was adamant and in no doubt that this is what he was told by the Australia Council. Prior to my making the statement in the Senate, I was also told by another unrelated source that he had also been told that Mr Keating was at the meeting at which the decisions were made.

Had the minister not tabled that letter addressed to me, I could have dealt with the matter by replying to the Australia Council; but since it is on the public record and some doubt has been cast on the ability of the librarian to accurately convey what he was told, I felt the need to put my point of view on the public record.

The error could have been made by the person asking the question or by the person taking it down.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly tonight on a matter relating to the extraordinary story of Mrs Magda Bardy, who, by an ironic twist of fate, found that she was living very near a person in Sydney whom she believed to have been responsible for the imprisonment, which led to the death, of her first husband in Hungary in 1951. I first raised this matter in the Senate on 20 May this year. Since then a number of developments have occurred which I want to bring to the attention of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Bardy, who has an OAM and who for many years has contributed a great deal of time and energy to sheltered workshops in Sydney, and her son, Ivan Somers, have been seeking from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, information concerning the processes that led to the approval of Mr Vajda as a migrant to Australia in the 1950s. Mrs Bardy and her son have also sought documents under freedom of information. These have now been received. They show that a Mr Vajda, a dentist, who arrived here under the assisted passage scheme in 1957, made no mention of a job that he had in Hungary as an officer with the AVH, the Hungarian secret police, or that he had served two years of a six-year gaol sentence imposed by the Military Court of Budapest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 30 May 1993, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> program, Mr Tibor Vajda, a retired Sydney dentist, acknowledged that he had been the deputy head of Department 6 of the AVH&mdash;or as he described it, a `political police force'&mdash;under the head of which department he had questioned prisoners. He had also said on this program that it was not impossible that it was his signature at the bottom of the page of the secret police document concerning Mrs Bardy's husband's imprisonment, although he also said that he had only very occasionally signed such documents when his superior officer was away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has also said that this document was an administrative document which came into existence after a person had been arrested and interrogated so as to record the decision of the head of the State Defence Authority, or AVH, as to what should be done with the person. He believed that it did not show that he had a major role to play in the imprisonment of Mrs Bardy's first husband, despite acknowledging the signature `Tibor Vajda' as possibly being his own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult for any of us here in the Senate to assess the facts relating to this case and to respond appropriately. My purpose in drawing attention to the matter again, following my raising of it in May, is to highlight the very complex issues that arise from it. If Mrs Bardy's claims are correct, then clearly it is possible that someone obtained firstly, permanent residence, and, secondly, Australian citizenship by withholding information which would have resulted in a rejection of both applications; that is, to settle, and that of citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Vajda entered Australia when the Immigration Act 1901-1949 was in operation. That act provided that any person convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for one year or more was deemed to be a prohibited immigrant. Prohibited immigrants entering or found within the Commonwealth were guilty of an offence under section 7 of that act. If convicted, a person would be liable for up to six months imprisonment or deportation from Australia. However, there was a 12-month time limit for commencing criminal proceedings under section 7. The current Migration Act 1958 does provide the minister with powers to cancel any valid visa at his or her discretion. The Australian Citizenship Act, however, does not allow a minister to revoke citizenship if fraudulent information was provided to obtain citizenship more than 10 years prior to the fraudulent information being presented. I think that is section 50(2) of that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 10-year provision is longstanding and has been in the act since 1958. I believe, however, that this particular case shows that it is possible to discover new information many years later relevant to whether or not the government of the day would or would not have bestowed citizenship on a foreign national. I raise the question of whether there should be some grounds on which it can be revoked, no matter how long ago the fraud&mdash;as it would be&mdash;took place. I acknowledge that the reason for the 10-year provision was to give certainty to the status of Australian citizenship, and that is a very important consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope, therefore, that this case and the issues that arise from it may come forward in the context of the current review by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations of the Australian Citizenship Act, as it is relevant to section 50 of the act. That will depend, of course, on whether the submissions on these matters are received by the committee in the course of its inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I raise in conclusion is that this matter, in this particular case, highlights the importance of our immigration checking procedures. It is a matter that has concerned me for some considerable time, as I think you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President. There are a lot of questions being asked and concerns being expressed in this area. The case I have referred to tonight goes back almost 40 years. We do need to be confident of the integrity and quality&mdash;particularly the quality&mdash;of our checking procedures in the 1990s. This case highlights the critical importance of the government ensuring that full character checks are undertaken in assessing all new settler arrivals and that there is, to the extent possible, the information necessary to enable those checking procedures to be carried out in a way that makes us all feel confident about the integrity of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of Mrs Bardy and Mr Vajda is a very interesting one. It is a very sad case in many ways. I do not know how it is all going to end, but it is one of those cases that captures the imagination from time to time and&mdash;more than the imagination&mdash;captures the heart. It is a matter that should certainly be of interest to the Senate, although I do not pretend to suggest that the Senate ought to have a role in its solution. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to distinguish between Macedonia, as I see it, as a northern part of Greece and a country which has been a province of Yugoslavia in the past and which uses within the title of its name the same word&mdash;`Macedonia'. The authentic and, I believe, genuine use of the term `Macedonia' is by the Greek people in the north of Greece with regard to the whole heritage that we now know as Macedonian. I believe that the use by slavonic people in the south of former Yugoslavia of the term `Macedonia' throughout this century is confused and usurping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me be clearer. In the northern part of Greece, based on Thessaloniki, the language spoken by the people is Greek. The Macedonian cultural heritage includes Alexander the Great and Philip, both of whom were Greek speaking, and the scholar Aristotle, who with other Macedonian writers wrote in Greek. The Macedonia of the Greek cultural symbols includes the star of Vergina, the white tower of Thessaloniki and the Dmitria festival. The predominant religion of Macedonia is Christian, as expressed for centuries and now today by the Greek Orthodox Church. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The confused and usurping use of the term `Macedonia' is by the former part of southern Yugoslavia, which is mostly a Slavic people, with a close affinity to Serbia and Bulgaria, where the Greek language is suppressed, even though spoken by a minority of residents of Greek origin. This southern province has now become an aspirant, independent country distinct from Serbia. It is currently admitted as a member of the United Nations under the name which has the initials F-Y-R-O-M. The name submitted to the United Nations is `Former Yugoslavic Republic of Macedonia'. The people of this emerging new nation have Slavic names&mdash;not Greek&mdash;the Slavic language and a predominant church which is neither Greek Orthodox nor Serbian Orthodox but independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 November last year in the House of Representatives, Mr Ron Edwards, the former member for Stirling, spoke urging his government to recognise FYROM under the title `Macedonia' as an independent nation. This led to others debating this matter. The government has not agreed to the request of the former member for Stirling. Since then he has lost his seat and this issue has been taken up by others, particularly in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 October, Senator Chamarette, also from Western Australia, put two questions on notice, No. 641 and No. 642, both directed to Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, asking him about matters arising from her concern for a Slavic oriented minority in northern Greece and others of this disposition, living now in Australia and calling themselves after FYROM, whose human rights are alleged to be restricted by the governing authorities in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it quite clear that I believe all of us in the Senate&mdash;certainly including myself&mdash;would want all minority people in every country to be accorded the full human rights set out in the United Nations conventions. On 1 September this year Senator Spindler also referred to the same issues referred to by Senator Chamarette. He based his adjournment speech on Amnesty reports, Helsinki Watch reports, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> of London and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of months ago, on 21 October in the House of Representatives, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), a New South Wales Labor member who claims to represent more people of the FYROM background than anyone else in Australia, made an adjournment speech in which he urged the Australian government to recognise the FYROM. Again, the government has not done so&mdash;I believe for reasons which are the basis of my own views as well and which I am reflecting in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 28 October Mr Hollis then placed a question on notice asking the foreign minister matters of fact with regard to the United Nations membership of the FYROM and with regard to why Australia had not recognised this emerging country in the Balkans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) As at 12 November 1993, forty (40) countries are known to have announced, or acknowledged, recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRM). For many of these countries recognition flowed automatically from their support for the FYRM's membership of the United Nations in April 1993.

Australia supported UN membership of the FYRM but this did not in itself amount to recognition, which in Australian practice requires a separate and deliberate act and cannot be inferred from any other action taken by the Government. Only duly accredited consular or diplomatic representatives can carry out the functions which are the sole prerogative of a consul. The opening of an office by the FYRM to perform consular functions and the accreditation of a consular representative cannot proceed until Australia recognises the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

Some of those refused entry were child refugees from the Greek civil war (1946-49).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A number of Australian passport holders were refused entry into Greece in 1988.

The Australian Government supports the observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights, and has made representations to the Greek Government when there is evidence to suggest that allegations of abuse of human rights may have some basis in fact.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition strongly believes it would be inappropriate to recognise a new state under the name of Macedonia against the objections of Greece.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition recognises that the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is in a difficult position as it is effectively in a state of international limbo. We recognise also that such a situation should not continue indefinitely as it is not in the interest of the people of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and it has the potential to further destabilise the region.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in Prime Minister Papandreou's words, giving up any "irredentist claims", Greece has indicated its desire to pursue economic and political cooperation with the new state.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst Mr Pangalos' comments may have ruffled diplomatic feathers, they certainly demonstrate that the spirit of October 1940, the spirit which led Greece to say "Ohi" [OKHI] to Mussolini's demands, has not dimmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the depth of Greek feeling on the issue, the Coalition would not prescribe to the Greek Government solutions to this very complex issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would, however, urge Greece to keep the lines of dialogue with Skopje open, because as events elsewhere in the Former Yugoslavia have demonstrated, the stark alternatives to dialogue and negotiation can be conflict and bloodshed.</PARA>

With a few other criteria, it would be subject to recognition by this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)-(8) As the then Minister for Trade, I met with the then Senator Bentsen in 1986 on official business.
