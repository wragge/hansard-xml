<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of the Australian Mining Industry Council's blunt refusal to take at face value Commonwealth assurances that its proposed Mabo legislation will validate all previous titles, will the minister now settle this matter once and for all and give the Senate an unequivocal assurance that all past titles for land will be fully secured and will not be affected by native title? Further, is it correct that, even where a possibly invalid mining lease is validated, native title rights will not be extinguished and will be restored at the end of the lease so that any proposed extension will need to be negotiated and paid for by mining companies?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2465" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mining industry, like industry and investors generally, does need predictability and security. That is exactly what this legislation is all about. We will allow validation of any existing grant which may have been invalid because of the existence of native title, including all rights under those grants, including rights of renewal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said all along that our legislation deals with the concerns of the states and industry that as a result of the Mabo decision there may be invalid grants. There is no point in legislating to validate grants that are already valid and there is no point, accordingly, in the legislation addressing that issue. AMIC's position does appear to be based on misconceptions about the government's proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation protects the rights of all existing titleholders. It does allow, as I have said, validation of existing grants, including rights of renewal. Any grant of interest in land which is invalid because of the existence of native title will be validated or able to be validated by the states and territories as a result of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not give native titleholders any new veto, de facto or otherwise. They will have the right to negotiate on actions affecting their land, but in no way do the tight but very fair provisions for negotiation and arbitration, if necessary by a tribunal, constitute a veto. There will be stringent criteria for registration of claimants to avoid delays through vexatious claims. Nowhere have we ever proposed that consideration of native title will have to precede other approval processes, which seems to be another thing that is worrying the industry. That is a complete misconception of our proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the revival of native title after mining leases expire is hardly a source of uncertainty because any native title will be subject to the grant during its life and the life of any legitimate renewals. Additional conditions or costs will not be imposed on existing exploration and mining titles. Generally, when you put all of that in a pot and look at the total picture, it is evident that we are providing a workable system that will be quite fair both to native titleholders and to the mining industry. Far from driving away investment, we are providing the certainty and the fairness that will encourage it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seems to be totally lacking in the appreciation of many commentators, whether fair-minded or otherwise, is an acknowledgment that the Mabo decision itself by the High Court introduced a degree of uncertainty. What the legislation is about is avoiding a protracted process of litigation to test the parameters of that uncertainty. Rather, we will by this legislation resolve a great many of the issues that, in the absence of it, would be left unresolved. That is the reason this legislation does make total sense from the point of view of the mining industry, the pastoral industry, the state governments and anyone else that is seriously minded to deal with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, I do not think the second part of it was answered. I ask, firstly, whether the answer given is an assurance that all past titles will be fully secured and not affected by native title. Secondly, do I take it the minister concedes that, at the expiration of a mining lease, it will be necessary to renegotiate and take into account not just any valid claims which might be established in due course but, indeed, as the mining industry says, that applicants for future grants would have to deal not just with native titleholders with proven claims but also with those who merely claim native title?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not dealt with because it has been dealt with a dozen times in previous answers. In the case of valid leases, which the legislation is not directly addressing, the government of course believes that the chances of success for any native title claim that may be made in respect of such leases are negligible. The legislation will ensure that the existing rights of those leaseholders are protected. That is because the legislation will validate any rights available to existing leaseholders if they would otherwise be invalid as a result of the existence of native title.

The states will have the capacity to do that if they choose to; they will be empowered to do so. That is as I understand the intention, and that is what again makes utterly inexplicable the approach taken by Richard Court. If we do not legislate to close off these particular avenues, create certainty through the legislative package that we are creating, we will leave ourselves open for endless litigation and endless uncertainty. That is the virtue of the Commonwealth legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NE4">Senator BEAHAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Following the passing of the budget bills in their amended form, can the minister inform the Senate of the current status of the government's medium-term deficit reduction strategy? Are there any implications to be drawn from this for future budget processes and for economic strategy generally?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2466" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="ARTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Beahan for raising what is an important issue and one which requires, I think, more consideration from some in the opposition in the Senate than it has to date received. The deficit reduction strategy which the Treasurer articulated on 17 August 1993 remains essentially intact. Of the extra revenue sought from the revenue measures passed by the Senate last week, the government will gather in 1996-97 some 97 per cent of the budget night estimate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this outcome cannot be overstated. We now have in place a medium-term deficit reduction strategy that will deliver progressive deficit reductions over four years: from $16 billion in 1993-94 to about $6 billion in 1996-97&mdash;that is, about one per cent of GDP in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have pointed out on several occasions to those who have paid any attention&mdash;and who now happily constitute a majority in the Senate, even if not all&mdash;international financial opinion, including that of the IMF, has placed great emphasis on governments having established credible medium-term fiscal strategies. They recognise the need to have a short-term increase in deficit for stimulus purposes. But they do believe it is very important that we have a medium-term deficit reduction strategy to deal with questions about interest rates&mdash;because a failure to do so would put up the pressure for increased interest rates&mdash;and to reduce the scope for capital formation and job creation. A failure to do so would lower the growth of output and income.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe most Australians, even if not the opposition, think those are issues worthy of serious consideration. I think they are concerned about interest rates. I think they are concerned about jobs, about investment and about output and income. Of course, they take as much notice of those interjections as I am proposing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of the few industrial nations that has put a credible medium-term fiscal situation in place. Other countries have tried to do so. For example, the very valiant efforts of the President of the United States have brought that country's deficit target for 1996-97 down to three per cent of GDP, whereas ours by 1996-97 will be approximately one per cent of GDP. Locking such a strategy firmly into place is very important. The business community recognises that it is important and welcomes it, because it knows that it provides certainty&mdash;certainty to plan, to invest and to expand. In achieving that outcome, the minor parties in the Senate have played a key role.</PARA>

In looking to the future and the new issues and challenges that will inevitably emerge, the Treasurer has indicated the need to establish processes that allow a continuing constructive role for those parties. I welcome that. A more open budget development process will be a bit of a test for all of us&mdash;a test for the budget development process and for our democratic processes. I think it is a very worthwhile endeavour. It can give us an improved budget process and, if it comes to pass, an improved budget outcome. The medium-term deficit reduction strategy is in place. It is important and it is welcomed by responsible commentators. Everybody except those opposite always knew that it was a good idea, and they will eventually wake up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said a moment ago that it is the government's judgment that the chances of success for a native title claim in any such context would, in our view, be negligible. The right to pursue an action through the courts, however, is one open to all Australians, whether they are likely to succeed or not. The government has been absolutely adamant, and remains so, that native title claimants should be able to do what all other Australians can do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition really is showing its true colours by running an argument that essentially would deny Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples the fundamental right to take legal action simply because of the effect it might have on other Australians. I repeat that the government believes that the real effect on other Australians will be negligible and certainly does not justify this kind of assault on routine individual rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is very interesting in this respect is how, increasingly obviously, Dr Hewson, in his leadership of the party, is being isolated on this issue and progressively disowned by members of his own party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. The question related to earlier assurances that title would be secured. Senator Minchin is asking why the government has departed from that position. It has nothing to do with what Dr Hewson might say or what Premier Court says. The minister should answer the question that he was asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The balance struck by this legislation, as we have said over and over again, is to take as given title which on the face of it is valid and not purport to do anything to remove people's rights in relation to that, on either side&mdash;just let people take any course of action they might choose to. What we do need to do to remove uncertainty is to take action right now to validate those titles which are&mdash;if there are any&mdash;manifestly invalid right now so as to ensure continuity of economic use of the land in question and to make provision, as I said in answer to Senator Alston a moment ago, to validate any title that might be found invalid by a court as a result of some process initiated by Aboriginal claimants based upon native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite are not satisfied with a process that produces that result, which makes provision right now for the validation of titles which are now invalid and which makes provision for the validation of titles which may be found invalid, they are simply incapable of satisfaction by any reasonable argument. That view is taken by their own party members. Former senators Chaney and Durack have a civilised appreciation of the balance that has to be struck here.</PARA>

Is it not a fact that there will be nothing in the legislation which will in any way immunise valid&mdash;that is, pre-1975&mdash;leaseholders from potentially successful challenge in the courts by any native title claimant believing that his or her rights still coexist with the rights of existing leaseholders?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal claimants are not stupid and are not going to waste time, money and emotional energy pursuing claims that obviously have not got a hope in Hades of succeeding, but nonetheless it is conceivable that in some cases claims will be pursued in order perhaps to clarify the native title status of some common law reservation, statutory reservation or something of that kind. It is conceivable that a claim of that kind might be pursued in order to establish the extent to which the native title interest can live alongside the previous valid interest. In order to cover that situation, the legislation provides exactly as I have stated. There is no ground for uncertainty there either.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should say first that my discussions with Mickey Kantor, my US counterpart, on 14 October were extremely fruitful. He has promised, as he said at a joint press conference at the conclusion of our talks, for the US to work with the Cairns Group and Australia and for him to work with me on completing the Uruguay Round and on securing the Blair House accord in its current form. He has undertaken that we will be involved&mdash;that is, the Cairns Group&mdash;in any talks that might come in the future over that agreement. He is not in favour of reopening or watering down the Blair House accord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the discussions in Europe, we first began on 18 October with a Cairns Group meeting. That has positioned the Cairns Group as the third force in the multilateral trade negotiations in the world and sharpened our tactics for the end game. In Europe, we lobbied in Paris, Bonn and Brussels. We saw governments in all those cities and had extensive media coverage internationally, nationally and in the city press of the cities that we were in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is about especially France. Until now, the debate in France has been one-sided. There are signs that it is now turning. In recent days, former French Prime Minister, Raymond Barre, former French President, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, and the current president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, have all said things in the French debate in France which are helpful to a conclusion of the round in a balanced way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the wine and spirits exporters have also come out supporting the round and, coming from the agricultural stable, that is quite significant for France. Recently, the SOFRES poll in France indicated that 48 per cent of French voters thought that the round would end with France signing the agreement, even though it was unsatisfactory for French interests. It should be remembered that four per cent of the French economy is devoted to agriculture and six per cent of the work force derive employment from agriculture. A completion of the round for the French economy would be worth in US dollars $25 billion, in French francs $150 billion, in extra income, and it would create half a million jobs in France. These figures are now increasingly part of the public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Elsewhere in Europe there is a view that for the round to be successfully completed `something' has to be given for France. I do not know what all that means but I think it comes down to this: the signs are that there could be some sort of change. I do not know what that change will be; it will depend on something happening. Australia and the Cairns Group will be involved in any of those ongoing debates about that and we will play our role in order to protect the interests of the agriculture fraternity in Australia and the best interests of our trade account in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next most important dates are Friday of this week when there will be a special European summit&mdash;I do not expect that will deal with GATT; it will deal with Maastricht&mdash;and 8 November when there will be a European Council meeting which I do expect will deal with GATT issues. Meanwhile, on the US side, the NAFTA bill goes to Congress shortly. It will be out, on the predicted timetable now, on the 17th. So we are shaping up to a last round of the Uruguay Round in the last month. That will be crunch time. We have positioned ourselves, I think, to exert as much influence as we could ever be expected to exert in order to get a good outcome for this round completed on timetable by 15 December and to ensure that the outcome is not a partial solution but a global package which features agriculture in a bold and balanced outcome for the round.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the full text of Professor Garnaut's reported remarks and I do not think it would be fair to him, under those circumstances, to seek to respond directly to what he is reported as saying. So far as the government's own position is concerned, it really is as has been stated on many occasions, and that is that our concern about human rights takes its place as one of a number of issues that we seek to pursue in a balanced and total way in our relations with all our regional neighbours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do, of course, regard trade and political relations as important. We regard as important our capacity to influence our neighbours on matters of traditional political diplomacy and matters of trade and economic policy. Our capacity to be influential in that respect depends, among other things, on our willingness to approach those issues, as others, in a reasonable and balanced way. But, at the end of the day, none of those concerns will stop us raising human rights issues where we believe it is appropriate and likely to be productive to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judgment we make about the effectiveness of the action will often determine the precise nature of the action that is taken&mdash;whether it is a public statement that is made or a private representation; whether it is an exercise in seeking to apply economic sanctions, or whether it is simply the taking of political action; whether it is doing things bilaterally or whether it is trying to do things multilaterally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my very firm belief that this approach that Australia has taken is well understood in the region, that it has been increasingly effective in recent years, and that it has not prejudiced our capacity to work with other countries in a balanced and effective way on a whole variety of other strategies in the region. The government certainly has no intention of accepting advice from any quarter to moderate to any greater degree than we are at the moment our human rights stance. Our judgment, I repeat, will be based always on the likely effectiveness of that stance, not on any anxiety about its implications for other policy areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past five years Defence has constructed new special training facilities for the Special Air Services regiment at Swanbourne, Western Australia. As the new facilities are being delivered, temporary facilities constructed in 1979 for interim use have become surplus to requirement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian government believes that all UN member states, without exception, should pay their assessed contributions in full and on time as is our practice. It is a basic obligation for member states under the UN charter to make these payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government is concerned that the 1994 budget bills passed by the US Congress last week, 21 October, will mean that the US will, in fact, drop further behind in its payments of UN regular budget and peacekeeping contributions. This can only have a negative impact on the ability of the UN to fulfil the heightened expectations that now exist of its role in the maintenance of international peace and security. Nor do I believe that the conditions that have been set by the US are likely, in practice, to contribute much that is helpful to the UN reform process. I will come to that point if I have time at the finish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is aware that the Clinton administration is working very hard to improve the US record in making financial contributions to the UN and we very much appreciate that the challenge that it is facing in this respect is coming more from Congress than from inside its own administration ranks. In fact, the Clinton administration on 6 October made a very substantial contribution of something over $500 million to clear the US pre-1993 regular budget arrears, and to also make a substantial payment towards its peacekeeping arrears. The trouble is, however, that new obligations continue to accrue, in particular, so far as peacekeeping operations are concerned, of which currently 17 such operations are in progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the administration requested the US Congress to appropriate $291 million for its 1993 regular budget payment and $66 million as a contribution to catching up on its arrears to the UN and a range of specialised agencies which were accumulated during the 1980s. President Bush had undertaken to clear those arrears by 1995. President Clinton himself repeated that commitment, including in his recent address to the UN General Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week Congress appropriated the $291 million for the 1993 regular budget, but directed that 10 per cent of this figure should be withheld, pending the appointment by the Secretary-General of an inspector-general as a watchdog against fraud and waste. It also decided to cancel entirely the $66 million in repayment of arrears. Moreover, so far as peacekeeping is concerned, the administration sought $619 million for peacekeeping operations in the year ahead, which was itself something of a low estimate, given that the anticipated requirement of the US will be in the order of $1.2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Congress has appropriated only $401.6 million of that and, in the process, directed the US administration to continue to work to reduce the US share of new peacekeeping operations to no more than 25 per cent of the total, whereas the United States' current assessment is 31.7 per cent. What all that means in hard percentage terms is that the US Congress has made provision for only about 30 per cent of the likely US UN peacekeeping bill this year. It has withheld 10 per cent of the US assessment to the regular budget and it has not made provision for any arrears payment in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the implications of all this for UN reform, which is part of the justification for the congressional attitude, let me say that while we certainly agree with a number of the specific objectives the US has in this respect&mdash;in particular, we are sympathetic to the proposal to appoint an inspector-general to combat fraud and waste&mdash;we do, nonetheless, take the strong view that reform can occur only in an atmosphere of mutual confidence based on member countries meeting their obligations. The UN really would become unworkable and consensus for reform unachievable if countries withdrew unilaterally their financial support. We certainly hope that the majority of members of Congress will recognise that the United States' capacity to influence UN reform simply is not aided by a failure to meet its financial obligations to the UN.</PARA>

I refer to the Acting Prime Minister's shameful response to the Burdekin report on people with mental illness in which he said, firstly, that funding is not the issue and money is not the answer; secondly, that the government will not approach the states until March 1994; and, thirdly, that much of the report is anecdotal and not based on any expert study. Does the minister support this blatant repudiation of Mr Burdekin's findings? Does the minister stand by his own claims made in the Senate when he said, firstly, that it would be difficult for any government to look at the Burdekin report and not realise that more money had to be spent; secondly, that additional Commonwealth funds were inevitable; and, thirdly, that Burdekin showed there was a paucity of services right across the nation?</PARA></TALK.START>

The pilot who carried out the landing was a fully qualified B707 co-pilot who had recently commenced upgrade training to become a captain. The pilot was under the supervision of a currently fully qualified B707 flying instructor. In accordance with RAAF training policy, available flying hours are fully utilised for the training and development of aircrew. For that reason, on both B707 and Falcon 900 flights which are not carrying a VIP, the co-pilot, who is the backup and safety pilot for the captain, flies the aircraft to develop and retain his or her currency.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Harradine asked me representing the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, on 21 October 1993:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why has not the Government given a higher priority to malaria control and to the development of vaccines or anti-bodies to alleviate this very serious problem?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My colleague, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs, has provided me with the following answer to the Honourable Senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health is an important sector within the aid program and increasing emphasis is being placed on malaria interventions. The Government is well aware that malaria is a significant concern among countries receiving Australian aid&mdash;particularly in the Pacific. Malaria is a major killer, and of special concern is the increasing resistance of the vector mosquitoes to pesticides, and of the malarial parasite to modern drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This financial year, approximately $37.4 million will be spent directly on health activities which represents an increase of approximately $8 million over 1991-92 expenditure. In addition, as the PNG program moves from budget support to project aid, it is anticipated that by the turn of the century, that approximately $40 million per year will be spent on health in PNG. These figures do not take into account the funds that are spent indirectly on health through our contributions to the international financial institutions and other multilateral agencies such as UNICEF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with internationally accepted health practices, Australian assistance concentrates on integrated, cost effective primary health care interventions. Although most activities are not specifically malaria-oriented, they do make a substantial contribution to the control and treatment of the disease through improved health education, supply of drugs, staff-training and more effective village and township health centres. In addition to supporting primary health care activities, the Government also supports direct malaria control programs in a number of countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Solomon Islands, Australia has been providing funds since the early 1980s for its malaria control program. This financial year, $500,000 has been allocated to this activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Vanuatu, a total of $147,093 will be provided this financial year for anti-malaria bed-nets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the South Pacific, Australia will conduct a joint planning mission with USAID to develop an integrated vector control activity with a strong public health theme to tackle both dengue fever and malaria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Vietnam, Australia is currently designing an aid project which will address the malaria problem through the assistance for the manufacture of anti-malaria drugs, early diagnosis and treatment of malaria and the development of new methods for reducing the transmission of malaria. A feasibility study report is currently being prepared and it is estimated that the project will commence in 1994 at a cost of $10 to 15 million over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is also supporting malaria research through the World Health Organisation program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR). Forty per cent of TDR's funds are directed to malaria research&mdash;including vaccine development. In the 1992-93 financial year, TDR received $539,000 from Australia. Although the 1993-94 contribution to TDR has not been finalised, it is expected that it will be maintained at approximately the same level of funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As can be seen, the Government does give high priority to malaria control and research. Australian assistance encompasses primary health care, direct malaria programs, commodity supply and research. This is an area of expansion within the aid program.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Schacht sought to use question time to suggest that the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, Mr Dean Brown, was talking down the MFP. In fact, Mr Dean Brown is recognising the reality that in all the years of the concept of the MFP, which must be nearly now a decade, there has been not one single financial commitment by a Japanese or overseas company to the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I heard in one interview last week, when these expressions of concern were emanating from Japan, as to why there had not been such commitments, the answer that was given&mdash;and it is a valid answer&mdash;is because there are not any projects in which the Japanese can yet invest. That is the tragedy of this concept&mdash;a concept that held great hopes for the future. Despite a decade in which it has been under the control of Labor, it has still not got to the stage where there is any project to which any international investment can be attracted. Surely one has the right to criticise that totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst error of judgment that was made in relation to the MFP was the selection of the swamp at Gillman as the site. I have it on good authority that when the Japanese delegation came out and was shown the selected site&mdash;the site that the Australian side had selected at Gillman, the swamp&mdash;they were simply bemused. They could not understand why something that we would want to trumpet as attractive to international investment would have been selected to be planted in a swamp. Unfortunately, that poor judgment has put the total concept of the project years and years behind. This government has committed tens of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to try to reclaim the swamp in order that a start might be made to the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be fairly said that we ought to be recognising with appreciation the incredible patience of the Japanese in relation to this matter. They are still committed to the concept of international funds helping to build science and scientific research with an industrial application at the really sharp end of international technology. They are also committed to the concept of partnership between Japan and Australia in that regard and of attracting investment from other countries. But we have let them down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with South Australia is that it has been governed by Labor.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Mr Brown has said is wrong. He said, `If you can get rid of the concept of the swamp at Gillman and join these institutions in South Australia that have international reputations of the highest level, give them some further capital to help them develop in these areas that are particularly attractive to industry, and offer specific projects to international investors&mdash;the Japanese and others&mdash;you will have something that you can really develop within the framework of the original concept of the MFP'. If Labor did that, it has a hope of producing real material benefit for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way that this project has gone&mdash;this government committing the project to the swamp at Gillman, investing tens of millions of Australian taxpayer dollars which have simply been lost&mdash;is evidence of appalling misjudgment. That is what Mr Brown has every right to criticise. Under a new Liberal government in South Australia, the project will have a chance of success because it will get back to the area that has the potential to attract real capital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this proposal was first launched in this chamber by a former senator, Senator Button, we had undertakings from him that no government money&mdash;that was repeated on many occasions when I asked questions; I think I asked some 15 questions on this over the years&mdash;was going towards this. This proposal was going to be privately driven. As far as I can ascertain, $167 million has been committed to the MFP at the Gillman site, not all of which has been spent. This is a totally unsatisfactory situation which needs to be repaired by pulling the plug on it now and not simply committing more and more funds to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect to this, which evidently the opposition has not yet caught up on, is the way in which this Labor government has repeatedly and consistently, over much longer than a decade, run down Australia's research and development capability. It has done so to the point where it is now going overseas on bended knee to the Japanese and to anybody else and saying, `Please come in and provide us with the technology that we are now no longer capable of developing for ourselves'. Australia has been a remarkably productive country. Senator Hill mentioned a moment ago some of the research institutions in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been remarkably productive when it comes to basic research. When we have had a piece of basic research which could be turned into some profitable product for sale, we have failed to make the transition through that particular stage. The government needs to come in and recognise those areas and provide assistance. Instead, what this government is doing is further pulling the plug on Australian research and development. The Japanese and other countries that perhaps might be attracted here will take our basic research away and develop it overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht should know from his own publication, which he put out after the budget, that only 0.4 per cent of research and development funds in last year's expenditure in this area came from foreign companies. Foreign companies are not investing in Australia. We have seen absolutely massive salaries paid to those people who are promoting the MFP&mdash;public relations merchants, not scientists. That is where the money is going. As Senator Schacht knows, Mr Kennan is being paid $300,000 per year plus a $70,000 bonus. Over the past few months, a number of other very highly paid people have come in to promote this project because clearly it is failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that the government recognised that it is failing and not go after the circuses. It is about time that it pulled the plug on it and put the money into those institutions that desperately need it. It should put the money behind those very good Australian scientists who are working with insufficient funds, who are working in decaying buildings with equipment that is falling into disrepair. The government should then get behind that research work and make sure that developments are developed in Australia and do not go overseas. That is what needs to be done, not this stupid idea of multifunction polises. </PARA>

Senator Schacht, in the dorothy dixer given to his colleague Senator Foreman, was priming up a question which he thought might bring some small amount of embarrassment to his opponents in South Australia; it has blown up in his face.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make two points. The first concerned the executive officer of the MFP, who has already been referred to and who has a very high salary&mdash;about one-quarter more than that received by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). His report, released in the middle of this year, was a very clear, plain speaking and straightforward analysis of the MFP as he discovered it in the three months since he had been appointed to the position. He said that there was a whole lot of hype and nonsense being spoken about the MFP&mdash;the project he has been appointed to administer&mdash;and he wished to disabuse those who were continuing with that hype. He called for a degree of realism in the way in which this whole project might be furthered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see realism in the remarks of my colleague Dean Brown, the Liberal leader in South Australia, who made a clear statement about the reality of this matter in South Australia. I refer not only honourable senators but also members of the press and the Australian public generally to the considered remarks of Mr Kennan, who has been able to look at every element of the MFP. I think Senator Schacht would acknowledge that the realism which has come from that statement must be considered and taken into account, even by him, and he should desist from continuing with the hype and unreality of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and final matter I wish to refer to is the comment made by Dean Brown, which is that any investment that would generate new activities, whether economic or academic, related to an international project such as the MFP ought to be invested by extension to the institutions that already exist in South Australia. South Australia has three excellent universities; a science and technology centre adjacent to one campus of one of the universities at Salisbury; another science and technology centre in the south that is developing and an industry base in various parts of the city and suburbs. It is in these established areas that the MFP ought to gain some real world shape by way of an extension of these already existing facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By all means, let South Australia be at the forefront in this country of fresh investment, especially in advanced technologies and in the extension of research, but let us be realistic about it; let us act upon the advice of the chief executive officer of the MFP, Mr Kennan and let us support the views of Dean Brown and the Liberal Party generally in South Australia. They are quite rightly castigating the federal Labor government and the state Labor government of South Australia for living in a world of hype and, ultimately, of nonsense and of misdirecting energies that could be put to a real world outcome. Let us see developments in South Australia which can be best furthered by the election of a Liberal government in the coming weeks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the motion that my question be noted. Firstly, I want to put a couple of things straight with respect to the history of this matter. I fully supported Mr Kennan's remarks made in the middle of this year that the Gillman site was not the only focus for the MFP. As the federal minister responsible for the MFP I welcomed that statement. Since Mr Kennan became the chief executive and now that the project is operating with a fully functioning permanent board, established by legislation in the South Australian parliament at the end of last year, we are now getting action at the MFP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that there was unnecessary delay in the previous two or three years, but that was due to the fact that we did not have a functioning MFP corporation board or a permanent chief executive. The chief executive, Mr Kennan, is an engineer; he is not a publicist. In fact, he has been abused by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> for not being a publicist and for not making public statements&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is now saying a few words. He is now getting out and selling the MFP. I want to refer to the Gillman site itself. From the very moment South Australia won the MFP, Gillman was made the core site. It was known full well that it was an environmentally degraded site. An argument put in favour of the site was that one of the themes of the MFP would be environmental rehabilitation. The Gillman site would be used elsewhere as an example of environmental rehabilitation. That was mentioned in the submission that South Australia put forward to win the MFP. It was not something `snuck up' on the Japanese or anybody else; it was in the South Australian submission. The justification was using environmental rehabilitation as an example.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese are still very keen on the environmental rehabilitation aspect of it. However, it has never been said from the beginning that the MFP would only be at Gillman. For example, there are discussions about part of the MFP project being involved in film production on a site in Queensland. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that Senator Ferguson would be interested to know that a former Liberal leader from Queensland, Sir Llew Edwards, is a member of the MFP board. I think that indicates his interest in the project. The issue of the development of the MFP has never been said to be just one site. It is a national and international project that will have connections around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we listen to Dean Brown, who is talking about removing the core site and saying that it will only be an adjunct to existing institutions, I think we then run a risk that this will be seen as just another variation of a technology park or science park in Australia, which is different from the MFP. From the federal government's point of view, we are committed to the MFP because of its international nature&mdash;not just because it is a tech park. I suspect it will be much more difficult to convince my colleagues in the federal government to give special funding to the MFP if it is a local South Australian tech park. There are a dozen tech parks all around Australia run by state governments. They would all be queuing up for funding. It is the international nature of the MFP that gives it its distinct feature and which attracts the commitment, in principle, for federal government funding for a national project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Japanese side. Mr Yahiro certainly expressed concern about the delay. I agree with him about the delay, but he made it quite clear that they are committed to the concept of the MFP. All the other senior executives I spoke to at that seminar said exactly the same thing. They made it quite clear that it is the recession that has delayed the investment that we would have liked to have seen. I agree that, until we got the full board and a chief executive this year, there was unnecessary delay back in South Australia with respect to getting that structure in place. We now have it in place. I think that South Australian senators opposite would be much better off being constructive in their criticism. They should remember that tech park and science parks sites are already included in the MFP site. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), to a question without notice asked by Senator Newman this day, relating to the Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA>In answering Senator Newman's question, Senator Richardson showed his total ignorance of the Medicare levy and what it brings in. It is a fact that only one-tenth of the taxpayers of this country have a taxable income over $47,355. An article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, said yesterday the Prime Minister should take out private health insurance or pay a higher Medicare levy.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High-income earners, including Prime Minister Paul Keating, should pay more into the public health system or pay their own private cover . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A table in that same article shows that the gross annual wage of Mr Keating is $179,174 and that he pays a Medicare levy of $2,508. The questions put to Mr Keating should be: have you had surgery in the past couple of years? Did you go to a private hospital? Did you pay for it yourself? Any private hospital would tell us that 10 per cent of the people who are admitted to it pay their own way&mdash;they carry their own insurance. They are already paying a Medicare levy&mdash;$2,500 in Mr Keating's case&mdash;they are not accessing the public system; they are going to private hospitals and paying their own way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson will be saying to Mr Keating, `You should pay a higher Medicare levy or take out private health insurance'. The cost of private health insurance quoted in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> is: HBA, $1,730; Australian Unity, $1,652; and Medibank Private New South Wales, $1,327. Senator Richardson cannot have it both ways. If he increases the Medicare levy he has to increase it to Mr Keating for Mr Keating to be paying $2,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a slur on the medical profession, and, again, this is the way Senator Richardson operates. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The trouble is, you see, when people on higher incomes drop out of private health insurance, they do elbow the old pensioner out of the queue because if you're on a hundred grand a year you know how to work systems.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way Senator Richardson works. I would like Senator Richardson to know that in the public hospital system&mdash;of which I was a proud employee for 30 years at three half days a week in the teaching hospitals in Brisbane&mdash;it was the medical necessity that determined where people came on a medical queue. It did not matter whether they were pensioners or whether they were prime ministers. If they had an urgent condition, they went straight to the top of the list. If they had a cancer of some kind, they went straight to the top of the list. We did not care who they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate that there are no wealthy people in the public hospitals that I have ever been associated with. There are very few who work the system. One always hears about the odd one who does but the majority&mdash;if one questions them&mdash;want private health care, they want access to a doctor of their choice and they want continuity of care 24 hours a days, seven days a week which private doctors do give their patients. </PARA>

He will only get that in a private system; he will not get it in a public system. It is like asking the Public Service to work and be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We just do not get it. In conclusion, I reiterate the questions that Senator Richardson should ask the Prime Minister: has he had surgery in the last couple of years? Did he go to a private hospital? Did he pay for it out of his pocket himself?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned about the answer that Senator Richardson gave to me today because he full knows, and has acknowledged publicly, that the crisis in the health system needs addressing. His response is that we need to get wealthy people into private health insurance. That is only one part of the measure.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Loosley</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 19 August 1993 to the Hon B. L. Howe, Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services, regarding amendments NHP2/1993 to the Nursing Home Financial Arrangements Principles ("the Principles").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter, you raised concerns regarding certain of the amendments which make provision for determinations by the Minister and by the Secretary of the Department in respect of funding for adjusted fee government nursing homes (AFGNHs).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFGNHs are State government nursing homes which are funded by the Commonwealth under a similar funding system to that for non-government nursing homes. New subparagraph 2(b)(ii) of the Principles sets out the transitional hourly rate (a component of AFGNHs' funding) which applies to AFGNHs for a maximum of 12 months after they become an AFGNH. The words "or such other amounts as are determined in writing by the Minister for the purpose of taking into account the changes with time in the cost of employing nursing and personal care staff" enable the Minister to vary the rates to take account of increases in award rates for relevant staffing categories. The transitional hourly rates are reviewed every three months and any variations are gazetted. If you consider it necessary, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services is prepared to take measures to amend the Principles to remove the above words, in which case, subparagraph 2(b)(ii) of the Principles will need to be amended every three months. However, the transitional hourly rates apply only to a very small number of State government nursing homes for a very limited time. Moreover, the transfer of State government nursing homes to the different funding system will be completed by the end of 1995/96 at the latest, after which this provision will cease to have any effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New paragraph 18(5)(b) has been deleted by an amendment to the Principles gazetted on 30 June 1993 and tabled on 27 September (amendments NH4/1993).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New paragraph 21(4)(b) and new subparagraph 32(30C)(a)(ii) both deal with funding for AFGNHs in respect of long service leave costs. AFGNHs' funding entitlement in respect of these costs is based on actual State average proportions of long service leave costs to nursing home payrolls for nursing homes other than AFGNHs in the funding year. During the funding year, the AFGNH receives an advance of its estimated entitlement, calculated using the actual State average proportion for the year before the previous funding year. At the end of the funding year, the home's advance is reconciled with its entitlement and any differences are taken into account in its funding for the following year. Paragraph 21(4)(b) covers the funding advance, while subparagraph 32(30C)(a)(ii) covers the reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words "the proportion determined by the Secretary as being the State average proportion of incurred long service leave costs to NPCE for nursing homes other than adjusted fee government nursing homes" have been included in both cases so that, if at the time the State average proportions are calculated for the purposes of the funding advance or reconciliation, data is unavailable in respect of a number of homes, the Secretary can determine State average proportions on the basis of available data. Without this discretion, it would be necessary to include in the Principles, notional State average proportions of long service leave costs to nursing home payrolls based on earlier years, and to amend the Principles annually to update these notional figures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be significant disadvantages in including notional figures in the Principles. What is important to the Government and to the AFGNHs is that the funding be based on accurate State average proportions. Notional figures based on earlier years will necessarily be inaccurate and their inaccuracy will be exacerbated by the lead time required to seek amendments to the Principles to incorporate updated figures. The use of notional figures could, therefore, cause AFGNHs to be significantly financially disadvantaged. If, on the other hand, there is the flexibility to make determinations close to the time advances are made and entitlements calculated, the determinations will relate closely to the actual State average proportions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The whole of the Commonwealth legislation on aged care is currently being reviewed by the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Commission will be specifically looking at the role played by subordinate legislation and the issue of sub-delegation. I would, therefore, like to request your Committee to allow the new paragraphs 2(b)(ii) and 21(4)(b) and new subparagraph 32(30C)(a)(ii) to remain on an interim basis.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 19 August 1993 regarding your consideration of the Fifth Amending Deed to the Deed establishing an occupational superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees and certain other persons under the Superannuation Act 1990 and in particular the changes to Rule 1.1.1.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to Rule 1.1.1 amending the definition of "spouse" and introducing a new definition of "marital relationship" were introduced in order to comply with the amended Sex Discrimination Act 1984 by removing certain discriminatory provisions. These new provisions mirror the changes made to the other Commonwealth schemes (eg the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme, the Defence Force schemes, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme and the Judges Pension Scheme). Importantly the changes provide slightly wider criteria under which persons can qualify for spouses' benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 11 of the Rules provide an extensive mechanism for the review of decisions made by the Board or by delegates of the Board. These provisions have application where a person requests reconsideration of a decision but also apply where the Board decides to reconsider a decision of its own volition. The discretionary powers provided by the changes to Rule 1.1.1 are subject to these review provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also mention that it is intended that the scheme under the Superannuation Act 1990 would be subject to the provisions contained in the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993 which are due to come into effect from 1 July 1994. A person could also seek review under that mechanism after the scheme's own review procedures have been complete.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the Government to take decisive action, using the powers at its disposal, including export controls, the corporations power and the external affairs power, to ensure that the requirements of the "strategy to protect old-growth forests and wilderness" agreed to in the National Forest Policy Statement are being adhered to by the State agencies responsible for forest management and conservation.</PARA>
<PARA>The need for this urgency motion has become increasingly apparent in recent months around Australia as we move into the 1993-94 summer logging season. There is an emerging consensus amongst conservation groups and those concerned to protect our natural heritage that the state agencies responsible for forest management are ignoring the conservation sections of the national forest policy statement. My own recent trip to the magnificent karri forests around Pemberton in the south-west of Western Australia has provided vivid personal evidence of the disregard shown by the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management for the need to protect old growth and wilderness forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement, which was signed by the Commonwealth government and all state governments except Tasmania in December 1992, was effectively born out of the failure of the current government to obtain agreement in this chamber to its Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1992. That bill and the subsequent national forest policy document received unanimous condemnation from the conservation movement due in large part to their emphasis on harvesting the forests. It is now an outrageous fact that even the limited conservation provisions in this national forest policy are being ignored, confirming the worst fears of the conservation movement that this government was yet again paying lip service only to the concepts of forest conservation and protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate at this point to reiterate the conservation provisions contained in the national forest policy. Section 4.1 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Conservation" commences with the laudable claim that: "Two of the principal objectives of this Statement are the maintenance of an extensive and permanent native forest estate in Australia and the protection of nature conservation values in forests.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement proceeds to outline a methodology for establishing an agreed set of criteria on which to base a reserve system and to protect those reserved forest areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness contains five basic elements. The first is the establishment of agreed criteria for determination of areas to be protected; secondly, an assessment of forests by state agencies; thirdly, an embargo on forest management activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forests or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value until assessments are complete&mdash;that is the crucial one which we are debating today; fourthly, the establishment of conservation reserve systems to protect old growth and wilderness forests on public land by 1995, those forests on private land that are to be protected in conservation reserves are to be established by 1998; fifthly, the development of management plans to appropriately protect old growth forests and wilderness values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage of its development, the key element of the strategy is the need for an embargo or moratorium on forestry activities in areas of forest likely to have high conservation value&mdash;the third element I mentioned before. If this element of the strategy is not adhered to by all parties, there will be little forest of high conservation value left to be protected. We find that the national forest policy is doing the exact opposite of what it is designed to do; that is, it is actually indicating those remaining areas of high conservation value and yet allowing a time lapse which the state departments are not protecting and which allows the industry to go ahead in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, I have recently alerted the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to extensive logging activities by CALM in Western Australia in the area known as Sharpe Block in the Roe area in the south-west of the state. This area was highlighted by the Australian Heritage Commission and CALM in their joint assessment of the southern forests of Western Australia as having high conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bridgetown Greenbushes Friends of the Forest have also been fighting for many years to protect areas of old growth and wilderness forest in Hester Block, Dalgarup and Mullalyup from logging. All of these blocks have been identified as having high conservation value. The submission from this group to the recent assessment of CALM's forest management plans highlights the value of Hester Block. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hester is ecologically mature and is locally most important environmentally, aesthetically and economically for industries and uses other than timber. CALM should recognise these community claims to the values it has failed to assess, and heed demand accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>That submission also highlights the general concerns of the conservation movement about CALM's logging activity. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want ecologically sustainable uses of the forest. It is the forest itself that must be sustained; not just the yield of wood. There is no virtue in sustaining a high wood yield from a perpetually juvenile forest. Such action would preclude multiple purpose. To cut and remove a substantial part of the forest within six years and the remainder within fourteen precludes multiple purpose and inter-generational equity.</PARA>
<PARA>In New South Wales the Wilderness Society and other conservationists have been protesting the logging of compartment 1402 in the Coolangubra wilderness in south-east New South Wales. This area, which was the subject of two logging bans in early 1992, contains forest giants in excess of 65 metres tall and 10 metres round. In addition, the forest contains many rare and endangered fauna such as the southern brown bandicoot, yellow-bellied glider and powerful owl. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three examples, which are only a small selection of similar activities in most states, are blatant transgressions of the third element of the strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness that I have just outlined. This logging activity is without doubt affecting those areas of old growth or wilderness forests that are likely to have high conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moratorium clause of the federal government's national forest policy would protect the best old growth and wilderness forests in five states&mdash;Tasmania, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia and New South Wales&mdash;if it were being acted upon properly. The frustration of the conservation movement is understandable. The quotation from a recent Wilderness Society media release is indicative. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fate of the forest giants in `1402' is symbolic of the desperate need to protect the endangered wilderness and old-growth forests of NSW. Experts estimate that only 2.5% of NSW is covered with wilderness forests . . . and overall only 5% of all NSW forests are still of old-growth quality.</PARA>
<PARA>Looking at the situation in Victoria, information on East Gippsland also reports breaches of the national forest policy. Thirty-four per cent of the wood utilisation plans are within designated high conservation areas, as per the national forest policy to the federal government, and included in this are Ellery Creek, Martins catchment and Brown Mountain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old growth survey has been completed. Forty-eight per cent of old growth lies outside national parks; the government aims to protect only 40 to 60 per cent. It has no intention of altering the 15-year licence sustainable yield commitments. To meet this, it will have to log in national parks, and there are allegations that this is already planned. Also up for logging are sites of significance and reserve wildlife corridors. Harris Daishowa has recently been granted 20,000 cubic metres of whole logs from East Gippsland. This is a breach of the state's timber industry strategy as well as the NFP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania we have similar problems because the federal government has given the go-ahead to Hampshire woodchip mill. This will be the biggest woodchip mill in Australia to be located next to Australia's biggest area of pristine rainforests. The Tarkine and southern forests have been identified as having World Heritage values by the World Heritage Bureau. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Murphy" NAMEID="FX5">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy can reply later, but I will quote him too; I believe he is a supporter of the concern people have about this mill being given the go-ahead by the Minister for Resources, Mr Michael Lee. In the next month or two, Mr Lee will be deciding whether to allow logging in areas of World Heritage quality in the southern forests. There are nine logging coups scheduled in the western tiers in the next few years. Tasmania is under threat because it exports 60 per cent of Australia's woodchips.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparent conflict between jobs and environment is an issue pushed heavily by advocates of logging, especially those who advocate logging of national parks or old growth forests and stand to gain financially. Old growth forests have been heavily logged by the timber industry in Australia to the point where they have almost disappeared in many areas. This is, by definition, not sustainable and should not be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmentalists are quick to point out, however, that there is little need for conflict&mdash;both jobs and a healthy environment are possible. This is the real challenge and also the very real opportunity for Australian industry. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 25 October, states that North Broken Hill Peko's Hampshire mill would have a direct and disastrous impact on the biggest block of pristine rainforest in the nation, and I agree. The article also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move has been opposed within the Labor Party's own ranks and has sparked the unlikely alliance of the green and union movements.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not an unlikely alliance at all; it is extremely logical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timber industries, however, insist that they can manage forests sustainably. They claim they have done so for many years, yet they continually demand the right to log last stands of old growth forest and claim their survival depends on this. The question needs to be asked: if they cannot survive now without logging the last old growth forests, how will they survive when they are gone? Obviously, something is askew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ecologically sustainable forestry means plantation forestry and agroforestry. The question is whether some old-growth forests should be saved before the industry becomes sustainable. The logging companies say no, but given the lack of old-growth forests their motive is obviously short-term profit. We as a community should not be forced to pay the enormous price of losing all of our old-growth forests because of the short-sighted perspective of some in the timber and forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plantations are more difficult to manage and more expensive than chopping down native forests&mdash;expensive, at least, in an economic sense. Some pine plantations are so poorly managed, for example, that the value of timber is being lost through lack of thinning and other maintenance operations, yet plantation management could provide both jobs and alternatives to old-growth forest logging. These jobs are not lost through environmental control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobs are, in fact, being cut by forest product companies. In the south-west forests of Western Australia, environmentalists have shown that job shedding occurs as the larger timber companies convert processing operations to more highly mechanised forms. Conservationists have shown that small mills, on the other hand, provide more jobs and use logged timber up to 50 per cent more efficiently. They process timber for higher value products such as furniture and building timber rather than woodchips or pulp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the North Broken Hill licence that has just been given, why is the government supporting a new licence to export 170,000 tonnes a year of woodchips from Burnie, in northern Tasmania, when not only the conservation movement but also the union movement in Tasmania are actively opposing the project because it will actually cost around 90 jobs in more labour intensive sectors of the timber industry? Senator Murphy&mdash;and I note he has left since his interjection&mdash;was speaking with grave concern about the questionable value adding quality of this particular way of utilising wood. He said that it is very questionable and that the way in which we actually cut down trees should maximise value adding. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people would say that if one looked at value adding on a dollar basis one would make it all into paper. It is probably true that on a dollar per tonne basis, paper is the most valuable manufactured product that one can get out of trees; but it does not employ many people, and it is going to employ fewer because of the technology that is available in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Murphy also spoke about waste, which is one of the most fundamental problems we have at the moment. He referred to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . so much wood that is wasted by way of woodchips, et cetera, just being shipped out of the state and certainly from the country in the rawest possible form . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Murphy said that surely this should not be allowed to continue. I thank him for his support of this argument. It has also been shown that successful plantations and agroforestry, in conjunction with proper ecological principles, will produce commercial hardwood crops within a few years. This approach will create jobs based on ongoing sustainable work rather than the current short-term extraction based approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge my colleagues to support this motion, which requests that the federal government take decisive action using the powers at its disposal, including export controls, corporation powers and external affairs powers to ensure that the requirements of the strategy to protect old-growth forests and wilderness agreed to in the national forest policy statement are being adhered to by the state agencies responsible for forest management and conservation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two matters on which I want to rebut Senator Chamarette. The first is in respect of the ongoing management of forests in Western Australia. I am aware that a model forestry management code was established at the beginning of last year. There are still some matters to be developed, but that model is continuing. I understand that it was welcomed by our federal Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and also by the forest industry and significant sections of the environment movement. I note that Senator Coulter is in the chamber and I understand that it was welcomed by him at the time as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with this issue, I do not accuse Senator Chamarette of suddenly rediscovering this issue in the light of some criticism of the Greens during the budget process. However, I understand the environment movement was a little concerned that the Green senators from WA were spending so much time on matters that, frankly, in terms of the budget should not have been preoccupying them as much as they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the powers of the Senate and the way in which this house should be used during the budget process, it is interesting to see the divergent views amongst the Greens about the use of upper houses. Whilst I disagree with Bob Brown on many matters in respect of the environment, I do agree with him and the Greens' very strongly principled position in Tasmania that upper houses should not be engaged in usurping the legitimate role of governments, one of which is the formulation and processing of the budget. But I note that the Greens from Western Australia do not have such principles. Perhaps they ought to get themselves together and find out what the role of an upper house should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Tasmania, there has been a blatant misuse of the recently announced Hampshire mill by Minister Lee in this argument about the use of forest resources in Tasmania, my home state. Certainly the trade union movement has some very legitimate concerns in Tasmania about the continuing decline in jobs in the forestry, paper manufacturing and woodchip areas of the industry in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette, quite rightly, quoted the views of Senator Murphy, a former official of the forest union. Senator Murphy, who has just come back into the chamber, was very unkindly criticised by Senator Chamarette. She made a note that he was not in the chamber. In fact, he was so interested in the arguments she was putting forward that he went to obtain some additional information for use in this debate. Unfortunately, because of the restrictions on the number of speakers, he is unable to make what would be a very worthwhile contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy has highlighted the problems that exist in the employment and industrial relations aspects of the forest industries in some areas in Tasmania. It would be wrong to assume from that that we agree with Senator Chamarette's misleading statement that the implication of the Hampshire mill being built next door to the so-called Tarkine wilderness&mdash;and I notice that these are the words, or words to very similar effect, that were used by Mr Marr in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> yesterday&mdash;is that the Hampshire mill is, in fact, drawing all its resources from this so-called Tarkine wilderness area. Again I notice that the allegation is made that it is the last stretch of pristine wilderness in Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons that the government will not support this motion that was put forward by the Greens is that it clearly demonstrates Senator Chamarette's lack of appreciation of the national forest policy statement. Indeed, the motion that she has put forward is internally contradictory of the national forest policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement contains processes which aim to promote ecologically sustainable forest development by ensuring the adequate protection of Australia's forests while at the same time allowing for the future development of our forest industries. These industries have a very strong and significant employment base, particularly in regional areas of Australia, such as Tasmania, where I come from and those that Senator Chamarette declares she represents. I note her heavy emphasis on regional employment in her recent alleged defence of the wine industry. She should certainly take this issue into account when coming to her position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national forest policy statement was developed cooperatively between the Commonwealth and the states. It outlines an agreed vision and policy framework for the management of Australia's forests. It is based on a cooperative partnership, recognising that the states have institutional responsibility for the day-to-day management of Australia's forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth also has a legitimate interest in forest issues. Under that national forest policy statement, the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments have agreed on a cooperative approach to ensure the protection of old growth forests and wilderness with a view to having a representative reserve system in place by 1995. In case Senator Chamarette does not know it, it is not 1995 yet. There is still some time for that representative reserve system to be put into place.

These will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value. Both the Commonwealth and the states recognise that some logging in old growth areas has been necessary as their resources are vital to the veneer and sawlog requirements of a major part of the forest industries. Again, these industries employ many people. Veneer and sawlog requirements are a very necessary part of employment in rural and regional Australia. In accordance with these arrangements, the Commonwealth is keen to cooperate with the states. To date, that cooperation has been quite extensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion before us fails to recognise that there has been substantial progress in meeting the national forest policy statement.

This is especially so when state governments are behaving responsibly in their management of forestry and in land management. Senator Chamarette's desire to use federal powers to override state responsibility is not the way this country should be run. Federal powers such as export controls, corporations and external powers were never intended to be used in the way that Senator Chamarette is proposing. Although Senator Chamarette's motion does not refer to New South Wales directly, it is primarily about the New South Wales decision to log compartment 1402 of the south-east forests in the Nalbaugh special prescription area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 there was an agreement between Mr Hawke and Mr Greiner&mdash;the south-east forest agreement&mdash;that would lead to the declaration of a national reserve system in New South Wales. There would have been Commonwealth funding for this. This accord is still alive but has not yet been signed. What we really need is Mrs Kelly to stop the political point scoring and get on with admitting that the 1990 agreement is a valid compromise as a result of which the conservationists will get their additional reserve areas and the industry will get guaranteed access to the remaining resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to the Hawke-Greiner forest accord, all states, except Tasmania, agreed to the national forest policy statement in December 1992. Under this statement the states and the Commonwealth agreed on a strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness. They agreed, firstly, to determine criteria for identifying old growth forests and wilderness; secondly, to undertake assessment of forests for conservation values, including old growth values; and, thirdly&mdash;and this is crucial to Senator Chamarette's motion&mdash;to avoid activities that may significantly affect old growth forests or wilderness that are likely to have a high conservation value. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats strongly support the motion moved today by Senator Chamarette. The national forest policy, which was signed last December by all governments except Tasmania, is a document cynical in its intent. The policy commits the federal and state governments to a strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness areas. Since it was signed, the destruction of our last ancient, old growth forests and wilderness areas has continued apace. There has been no let-up, and there will be no let-up until there is strong pressure brought to bear on this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supposedly shared commitment to save our unique natural heritage from the ravages of the woodchip mill is being flouted around the country and this government is doing nothing about it. Not only is this federal government failing to act, it is even propounding the view that there is nothing it can do to save the forests. This is the largest dissimulation of all time. There are many actions this government can take, and I will deal with some of these later on. The fact is that this government's failure is a failure of political will. It is that failure of political will that allows the destruction of Australia's magnificent ancient forests to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of forest protection, the national forest policy outlines a strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness. State forest agencies are to undertake assessments of forests for their conservation and wilderness values as `a matter of high priority'. The strategy also states that until assessments are completed&mdash;this is the important point, picking up on Senator Sherry's remarks&mdash;forest management agencies will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.</PARA>
<PARA>This has become known as the `moratorium clause' and it is the critical area of contention. This is what the strategy says in theory; in practice, the state forest agencies are raping the forests while the federal government is lying back and thinking of the republic, unwilling to stand up for its own policy&mdash;a policy shared with the rampant states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many inquiries into the future management of Australia's forests. Inquiries have been carried out by the Resource Assessment Commission, the National Plantations Advisory Committee, the ESD forestry working group and the Industry Commission, which reported on forest products. Forest protests have occurred throughout the 1980s and into the early 1990s. Yet in 1993, we are still fighting to save what should have been considered a natural heritage so precious that we should not dare to sacrifice it to the pulp mill or sawmill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our old growth forests and wilderness areas are our natural heritage. They are irreplaceable treasures which can never be reconstructed by human hands. To say, as the forestry industry does, that the forests will grow back as they were is simply a lie. Humans cannot replace 300- to 500-year-old trees and the complex ecology associated with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critical point is that we are dealing with two different views of the world when we talk about forests. On the one hand, the forest industry looks at old growth forests and all it sees is timber; on the other hand, conservationists and the community at large see the forest as an inspiration in a world of concrete, metal and straight lines. They see it as a haven for biodiversity, as a thing that is precious and beautiful and valuable in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the middle lies the government. It says that it is committed to ecological sustainability, but we have not seen that commitment translated into action. Most ordinary Australians expect the government to save our natural heritage for all Australians who are alive now and also for future generations. If we stand back and allow the destruction to occur, we deny our children and our grandchildren and all succeeding generations the joy and peace that we derive today from the existence of these magnificent areas. I ask this chamber: is that fair? Is that fair to later generations? Will their humanity not be diminished if these experiences are denied them, and denied them by the present generation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is also the role of government to ensure that all people have jobs, but the key point that this government seems unable to appreciate is that sustainable jobs are found in plantations and not in the ever dwindling old growth forests. They are not found in forestry practices that have moved increasingly into high capital, low labour woodchip exports. This government is not acting in the public good. It is in the pocket of the forest industry. If it were acting in the public good, it would use its powers to stop logging in high conservation value areas. Let there be no mistake: it does have those powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This spring and summer we will witness, if nothing is done to stop the destruction, the devastation of our forests on an unprecedented scale. In New South Wales, one of the most blatant examples of the state government's failure to commit itself to the national forest policy is the controversial decision to commence logging in compartment 1402 of the Nalbaugh state forest. This area is listed on the National Estate and is part of the Coolangubra wilderness area. Compartment 1402 is home to five endangered animal species.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other areas of the state are under threat from logging, including Barrington, Chaleundi, the Kempsey-Wauchope forests and the old growth forests of the Bulga Plateau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, Brown Mountain on the Errinundra Plateau is up for logging. So too are the old growth areas of Ellery Block and Yalmy Creek&mdash;two of the last pristine water catchments in the east Gippsland region. These areas are home to the long-footed potoroo, an animal that is supposedly protected by the federal government's Endangered Species Protection Act. Logging threats to the potoroo only serve to highlight the total inadequacy of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland, logging continues to take place in the state forest on the Clarke Range situated on either side of the Eungella National Park, west of Mackay, as well as the Conway State Forest, adjoining Conway National Park east of Proserpine. Both these areas have been identified as being of high conservation value and comprise old forest growth types. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, the Court government has decided to triple the quantities of karri, jarrah and marri to be extracted from the south-west forests. Clearly, this decision will have a catastrophic effect on the remaining old growth forests and will greatly exacerbate problems associated with dieback in these forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, Tasmania did not sign the national forest policy. However, the destruction of Tasmania's forests cannot be ignored in this debate. The state government is logging forests in the south-west of Tasmania and the great western tiers. These areas have been identified by the Australian Heritage Commission, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, the Tasmanian Department of Parks, Wildlife and Heritage, and even the World Heritage Bureau as having World Heritage values. Many of these logging operations are destroying wilderness that is, quite frankly, irreplaceable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the third session of the renegotiation of the international tropical timber agreement held recently in Geneva, the Australian delegation issued a statement saying that the Australian government would protect old growth forest and wilderness values by 1995 for all Australia's forests. The Australian branch of the Worldwide Fund for Nature issued a press release welcoming the government's statement to the world community which clearly signalled the federal government's intention to overrule state governments which fail to act on the forest policy strategy. The Australian delegation's statement relating to all Australian forests has to be seen to include Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Michael Rae of the WWF warned that the government must honour these pledges or rightly be judged as a hypocrite. In that regard it is not too cynical to believe that the government purposefully developed a strategy to protect old growth forests and wilderness knowing that it would not be adhered to by the states.

Now the government can say, `We are abiding by the policy; it is the state governments who are not keeping their side of the bargain'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that the Commonwealth could not see that the states were never going to keep their bargain in the first place? The simple answer is that the federal government was looking for a way out of the issue. It wanted to be able to say `The Commonwealth isn't to blame'. Well, who believes this? It just leaves the government's credibility on forestry matters in tatters. It has been a deliberate policy of this federal Labor government to abandon its responsibilities and to hide behind the facade of intergovernmental agreements. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can the Commonwealth do?

As we have seen in recent weeks, Senator Richardson is on record as saying that he was prepared to use the corporations power to override Victorian tobacco advertising legislation. The corporations power was also used by this government in its ozone protection legislation. So the government is prepared to use the corporations powers but not, evidently, to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to actions that the government could take. It could prohibit logging using the trade and commerce powers; it could introduce tighter restrictions on foreign ownership of corporations involved in woodchipping operations; it could use the Commonwealth tied grants power; it could fulfil the spirit and the letter of section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. This section requires a Commonwealth minister to ensure that any department or agency administered by him or her:</PARA>

The environment was one of the top three concerns of Australians, coming third after unemployment and violence and personal safety. Australians worried more about the environment than any other country polled. This does not surprise the Australian Democrats, who know that the environment is a deep concern for many Australians. I have personally received many letters from people all around the country about the fate of our forests. These people are very distressed to see our natural heritage being destroyed year after year.

This was due to political pressure stirred by the Greens and acted upon by the Labor government. This was to the detriment of workers in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That having been done, there have been continuing rows between the Commonwealth and the states over forest issues; again largely stirred by the green movement. There has been a continual argument about whether areas should be preserved or used for multiple purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, the government set up the Resource Assessment Commission which ran for over two years and cost millions of dollars. Its purpose was basically to examine and take evidence about what the truth of the argument was about preservation versus multiple use of forests. In the end that report concluded that native forests could be used largely for multiple use, although some areas needed to be set aside for nature conservation&mdash;they needed to be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that extensive study the Commonwealth and the states agreed on a national forest policy statement. All the states except Tasmania signed that agreement. The only reason Tasmania did not sign was that there was disagreement between the Commonwealth and Tasmania about re-using some of the information from some 15 surveys that had been carried out in Tasmania. This was largely due to political pressure. That matter still has not been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the forest policy statement there was agreement that there would be a survey of the old growth forests of high conservation value across all states. As my colleague Senator Crane said, this was done in a very excellent manner in 1991 and in early 1992 in Western Australia by an agreement between the Australian Heritage Commission and CALM, which is the Western Australian department responsible. The Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories, Mrs Kelly, claimed peace in our time from that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe all the states are managing their forests well. It is absolutely impossible for this parliament or the Commonwealth government to get involved in block X or area Y or block Z here or there around the nation. That cannot be done. Large areas of forests can be managed from here only by agreeing on the process. We have been through that process. There has been agreement on the process and we should stand by that process. I support the amendment to the urgency motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many words have been said today. I think one of the most important statements that can be made today is that the green movement in Australia is not divided in its concern about the flagrant disregard for forest conservation strategies. One has only to look at the work that Senator Chamarette has done over the year. One need only refer to questions and notices of motion in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. One can ask the conservation groups in Western Australia about the continued efforts of the Greens (WA) in this debate and about the very strong network, communication and ability it has to keep these issues in the public debate in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Senate an idea of the work of the Greens (WA). We have had to deal with the pressure that has been put on us from a number of different areas and a number of major debates and issues in recent weeks. Senator Chamarette made a visit to the Hawke Block just a few weeks ago on request from the people who work in this area. They are just about at the end of their tether with regard to government policy. I was asked to visit the South East Forest a couple of weeks ago. I also visited and walked down the catchment at Tantawangalo&mdash;I have the bruises to prove it. I have visited the Hester Block in Western Australia in recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, the Greens (WA) is the only party to stand up to this destruction in recent times. I have had calls from members of the Labor Party and the coalition parties asking whether the Greens (WA) can do something to bring this issue even more to the public fore. They recognise that nobody else is prepared to stand up for these issues. The CALM-HAC agreements in our states have been used to the advantage of those people who would like to log to destruction many of our old growth forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was mentioned earlier that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission should be supported in its efforts. However, it hardly seems that money is being made for the government or forestry in that area when $400 million of accumulated debt has had to be written off. It is not necessarily the best policy for money making. One of the statements that should be taken into consideration or reiterated is that the real costs of many of these decisions are borne by the community.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bridgetown Green Bushes Friends of the Forest has stated that the real cost of re-establishing old growth forests in an area that is currently allowed to be mined for gravel will be about $17 million. So this is not just about the production of timber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gibson talked about multiple use. But what is the real multiple use that provides income and jobs for the greatest number of people in regions? I argue, as do many people in the conservation movement, that multiple use is actually locking out a great many economic activities of greater benefit for the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can have our cake and eat it too in terms of providing timber production in agroforestry and in plantations, especially on land that at this stage has been degraded by some other farm practices. Smaller mills can be used for plantation artisan-based production. These areas can exist with beautifully protected old growth forests. Jobs can be created in areas which are attractive to live in or visit. This arrangement has the added benefit of providing extra income, in terms of agroforestry, to those farming sectors that are currently under pressure. We have a very one-sided argument. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>I wish to take this opportunity to address the tabling of the revised strategic plan 1991-93 of the Australian National Maritime Museum. The Australian National Maritime Museum is a cultural resource with great educational and recreational potential. It is important that this museum prevails as a viable cultural institution, both as a monument to the national service of past generations and to our maritime culture, as well as being an historical centre for Australians of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The museum also represents a diplomatic relationship between Australia and the United States in that the USA gallery was donated to the museum by the former President of the United States, George Bush. The USA gallery is a most interesting gallery. I would recommend that when honourable senators who do not live in New South Wales are visiting Sydney they should go to see the National Maritime Museum and spend some time in that gallery. Australia can look to the museum as a bicentennial consecration of our defence bond with the United States by its portrayal of the history of that bond over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, however, the Australian National Maritime Museum is suffering from a range of problems in the fields of finance, housing, administration and marketing. Dr Kevin Fewster has a great challenge ahead of him. The coalition supports him in his cause to address those issues and in particular through this strategic plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Maritime Museum is slightly off the beaten path for the main group of tourists who visit that area, which poses a problem. Also, the museum was not purpose-built for the particular displays that it has. When I visited the museum I was told that there are enormous overheads on such items as air-conditioning for this very large building. I endorse the strategic plan's view to a more dynamic facility, including greater financial management of projects through staff training, formal procedures and post-project evaluation. The museum had hoped to be more self-supporting than it has been able to achieve and when one visits, one can see some of the problems because of its location and because the building was not specifically designed for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to honourable senators the strategic plan and the museum. Visiting the museum, I believe, enables young Australians to develop a greater understanding of some of the historical developments in Australia because of our isolation. Those of us who remember going to the wharves to see friends off and throw streamers to ships realised then how isolated we were. It was not until we had the migrant postwar influx that many of us were exposed to other cultures in a way that I think many young Australians take for granted now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse the needed thrust of the strategic plan towards raising the profile of the museum in the community, not only at the local level but also for the tourist dollar. I would like to take this opportunity to applaud the museum's move to tap into the market of Australian schools through Kay Cottee's promotional correspondence with schools, writing to them and suggesting that they visit the museum. I ask honourable senators to commend the museum to their schools when they are visiting. It is an important part of Australia's history and culture that requires our support. I commend the strategic plan to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with 1993-94 Budget decisions and other decisions made by the Government in respect of higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for over $4.6 billion for higher education in 1996, including some $500 million to be provided by the Government through the HECS Trust Account. As well, the bill provides for funds that are additional to those already legislated for. These additional funds total over $50 million in 1993, over $270 million in 1994 and over $320 million in 1995. Measures put forward in the bill will also generate additional revenues of $123 million in 1994, $183 million in 1995 and $126 million in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has framed the measures covered in this bill to meet the need for enhanced efficiencies in higher education funding. These measures will also advance national goals relating to access, equity, diversity and quality in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's provisions include an amendment to the contribution made by certain students under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme&mdash;HECS. The change requires students who have already had access to undergraduate, professional and postgraduate opportunities to contribute, in general, twice the standard rate of HECS from January 1994 should they enrol in a second undergraduate course. The reasons for this change are very simple. Every student who undertakes a second undergraduate degree is excluding a school leaver or another person from attending university at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other measures put forward in this bill modify repayment arrangements for HECS. From July 1994, repayment rates will be lifted from the present 2, 3 and 4 per cent levels to 3, 4 and 5 per cent respectively. Concurrently with this change, income thresholds for repayment of the HECS debt will be re-aligned with actual average weekly earnings. In addition, from July 1994 HECS repayments will be made on a PAYE and provisional tax basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The HECS amendments in this bill are both equitable and realistic. The measure relating to the amount of contribution stresses that as many Australians as possible should have access to higher education and that those who do have the chance to participate should contribute to the cost of that experience in the fairest way possible. This amendment acknowledges that in a climate of budgetary restraint the opportunities of newcomers to the system, including recent school leavers, have to be protected and that our students need to think very carefully about their study options. The amendment complements other initiatives which the Government is undertaking, in the context of its educational profile negotiations with institutions, to restore opportunities for those new to higher education, especially recent school leavers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the HECS measures introduced in this bill will reduce Commonwealth Government outlays to higher education and hence the public sector financial burden. HECS is not a tax. It is a deferred repayment loans system. As such, it is in the first instance a Government outlay and any reduction in student contributions requires greater Government expenditure. Income received through HECS is directly linked to the Commonwealth's ability to provide additional student places. In the same way as HECS has already provided opportunities for more Australians to participate in higher education, the HECS measures in this bill are essential for the Government to meet its ongoing commitment to increased access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions relating to income thresholds and the rates at which the HECS debt is repaid shorten the repayment period&mdash;from 15 to 9 years for the typical graduate&mdash;without increasing the actual cost to students. These measures also recognise that Commonwealth funding of the massive growth in higher education since 1989 has substantially exceeded HECS revenue. For example, income from HECS last year, including up-front payments, voluntary repayments and payments against HECS debt assessments by the Australian Taxation Office amounted to about $195 million. This was less than 5 per cent of the total Commonwealth 1992 outlay on higher education of $4.3 billion, which was $274 million above the level of funding provided in 1991. Outstanding HECS debts currently total in excess of $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under another measure introduced in this bill, students undertaking at least 75 per cent of a full-time study load through the new Open learning Initiative (OLI) will have access to a deferred payment facility similar to HECS. The OLI is already extending opportunities for a significant number of Australians who would otherwise find it difficult to participate in higher education by virtue of work commitments or other circumstances. Provision already exists for the Government to fund the development of a decentralised network to support open learning students. A deferred payment facility will further help these Australians by making it easier for them to make the required contribution to the costs involved in their education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional growth in higher education for 1994 and 1995 has already been announced. This bill further expands opportunities for access in 1995 and 1996 with its provisions concerning any spare capacity which institutions may have.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's amendments in respect of research and postgraduate education funding reflect the Government's policy of encouraging the higher education sector to maintain and strengthen its quality of provision and high international standing. The Government will continue the Research Infrastructure Program beyond 1994 at an enhanced level, providing $56.4 million in 1995 and $60 million from 1996 with total Infrastructure Program funding amounting to $176.4 million over the 1995-97 triennium. From January 1994, the Government will integrate the Australian Postgraduate Research Awards, the Australian Postgraduate Course Awards and HECS Exemption Scholarships into a single Australian Postgraduate Awards Scheme. 20,700 of these new Awards will be available in 1994, rising to 25,500 in 1997, an increase that will help expand participation in postgraduate education and thereby assist Australia to enhance its competitive edge in higher education and research. These measures will complement the further deregulation of postgraduate provision, allowing universities to build a postgraduate fee-paying market. Universities will be free to innovate, for example, by using Commonwealth postgraduate load to subsidise fee-paying students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's commitment to increasing the efficiency, flexibility and productivity of the higher education labour market is reflected in its support for the introduction of workplace bargaining. A national framework agreement for agency bargaining has been reached which the Government will support. This bill provides for on-going supplementation to be made available to universities for funding economic adjustments consistent with the Australian Public Service arrangements which provide 1.4 per cent followed by 1.5 per cent twelve months later. The arrangements cover both academic and general staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government will offer to each institution an advance of funds for a sector wide productivity related salary increase of up to 2 per cent for both academic and general staff. This would be conditional on there being agreement as regards a broad range of productivity related measures. There will be no on-going supplementation provided by the Government for productivity related salary increases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to consolidate amounts at present specified separately in the legislation for quality, research, equity, National Priority (Reserve) Fund and advanced engineering centres. The distribution of funds across these programs is determined three years in advance but allocations to universities for most of these programs are made annually. This unnecessarily inhibits the capacity of Government and higher education institutions to respond to needs that emerge over the course of a triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this bill proposes the consolidation of funding, the specific purposes for which grants can be made will remain unaltered and programs will not be administratively affected. While the total level of available funding will continue to be legislated three years in advance, allocations will be decided annually and announced in the yearly higher education funding report. The value of this measure lies in the increased flexibility it will accord to recurrent funding arrangements. This will in turn assist universities and the Commonwealth to achieve their objectives with greater efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the measures put forward in this bill are part of the Government's overall strategy for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the higher education sector. These measures seek to expand opportunities for Australians while recognising that there are limits to the contribution available from the tax-payer. They aim, in addition, to stimulate Australia's diverse higher education sector to maximise its capacity for providing a high quality product that meets the needs of its students and the nation as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes to establish a pilot program for transition support for students with disabilities for an initial period 1994 to 1996 at a cost of $5.1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally $3.6 million developmental funding is to be provided over three years from 1994 to 1996 to support existing and developing hostels for rural school students. The Students at Risk program, which was due to cease at the end of 1994, will be extended for a further two years, with funding of $13.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also finalises the full implementation of the National Equity Program for Schools for 1994, including the broadbanding provisions endorsed by the Australian Education Council which provide financial assistance under four elements focused on access, equity, national priorities and incentives. Following agreement with school authorities these new provisions will replace the interim arrangements that existed in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a number of other changes :</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">strengthening the Commonwealth's New Schools Policy for funding new and changing non-government schools; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, this bill will provide funding schedules for programs under the National Equity Program for Schools and joint programs to support primary and secondary education for the remainder of the 1993 to 1996 funding period. I believe this will provide State and non-government school authorities with greater certainty in their future funding and facilitate a better planning basis over the medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill sets grant levels for schools in the 1994 program year which are estimated to be $2.901 billion. Funds appropriated by this bill for the 1994 program year are estimated to be some $2.286 billion for general recurrent grants to Government and non-government schools, $303.7 million for capital grants to Government and non-government schools, $286.0 million for national equity programs, $18.0 million for the School Language Program and $6.5 million for other joint programs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Childcare Rebate Bill 1993 will provide for the payment of rebates for expenses incurred for work-related child care as announced by the Prime Minister on 9 February 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill realises a key election promise to the families of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is another promise made and kept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cash rebate is a major plank in this government's commitment to increase the number of child care places, to make child care more affordable and increase the choices for Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an investment in our future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government recognises that women are unable to participate actively in the workforce unless they have access to affordable child care. The skills of women with workforce experience are extremely valuable in an economy dependent on the training and flexibility of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cash Rebate will substantially increase the ability of women to work and to undertake further study and training. In short, it will allow them to contribute the full wealth of their talents and abilities to national growth and prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child care is no longer a welfare issue. It is an economic issue and is now an integral part of the government's approach to building a highly skilled and adaptable workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Childcare Rebate is part of the Labor government's comprehensive child care policy. It recognises that most parents need quality child care at some stage of their working lives and that they need help with the cost of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rebate will significantly improve the affordability of child care for working parents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It builds on this government's outstanding record of assisting families with dependent children through its support for child care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Labor government was elected in 1983 there were just 46,000 operational child care places.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are now more than 208,000 child care places in Australia. Budget funding for an additional 29,000 places will lift the number to approximately 237,000 by the end of this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government has also promised to meet all demand for work related child care by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will mean an increase in places to more than 300,000 by 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we have put money where our mouth is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth outlays have grown from $65 million in 1982-83 to over $550 million this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And as the places have grown, we have ensured that ordinary Australian families can afford to use the child care facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year alone, an estimated 170,000 low and middle income families will benefit from Long Day Care Childcare Assistance of up to $108.50 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, the government has extended the more generous long day care Childcare Assistance to directly Commonwealth funded Occasional Care Centres from 1 July 1993. This has benefited a further 20,000 low and middle income families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1993 the Prime Minister announced further initiatives to build on Labor's child care commitment to families. These included:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the establishment of a care for sick children program. This will help employers establish sick care facilities and provide for suitable separate sick care facilities in child care centres and Family Day Care schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to keep child care affordable, the Fringe Benefits Tax exemption was also extended to approved employer sponsored Family Day Care, Outside School Hours Care and Vacation Care services on 1 July 1993. The 1993 Budget legislation includes sales tax exemptions for goods used by child care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to ensure quality care for Australian children, the new Accreditation and Quality Assurance System will be implemented in child care centres from 1 January 1994. This fulfils yet another election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1993 Budget provides funding to implement these initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Childcare Rebate Bill 1993 is another important step to ensure that child care is affordable for all working families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many families do not currently receive any government financial assistance for child care because their joint family income exceeds the threshold for child care assistance, or because they use informal care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1994, parents using child care while in employment, training, studying or looking for work will be able to claim a rebate for part of their child care expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An estimated 230,000 families with 358,000 children will benefit from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Prime Minister said in Investing in the Nation, the childcare rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents earning an income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just like other concessions for expenses incurred in earning an income, it will not be means tested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tax deductions of $4.9 billion each year are provided for work-related expenses such as subscriptions for professional associations and trade unions, car expenses and professional libraries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the child care rebate is a long overdue recognition of the costs of child care borne by parents and particularly mothers, in earning an income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill recognises that all working families are entitled to some recompense against the cost of work related child care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And to ensure that the benefits flow on to low income families, the government took the more equitable decision to provide this assistance as a cash rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will assist low income women and families because the rebate will be able to be claimed as the expense is incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A deduction would have forced many families to carry these costs for more than a year before they could claim any benefit. It would also have provided greatest benefits to higher income earners. People below the tax threshold would not have benefited at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, the use of a rebate ties the level of the benefit to the cost of child care incurred by the parent and not to the level of taxable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Rebate will be payable fortnightly through Medicare Offices of the Health Insurance Commission. Eligible families will pay the first $16 of weekly child care costs and then be able to claim 30% of their costs up to a fee ceiling of $110/week for one child in care or $220/week for two or more children in care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum weekly rebate will be $28.20 per week for one child ($1,466/year) and $61.20 per week for two or more children ($3,182/year). The cash rebate is paid over and above Childcare Assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rebate will be paid for all work-related child care expenses for children aged up to twelve years of age. Child care expenses incurred by working parents in Long Day Care centres, preschools, Family Day Care, Outside School Hours Care, Vacation Care and in private child care arrangements will be eligible for the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child care expenses incurred in care services not eligible for government assistance have also been included in recognition of the fact that almost two thirds of working families use these care arrangements, either by choice or because formal care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Care can be provided either in the child's home or another person's home. Carers must be over 18 years old and parents are excluded from claiming the cost of caring for their own children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child care providers, whether in formal child care services or at home will be required to register with the Health Insurance Commission through Medicare Offices and provide proof of age, proof of compliance with relevant State licensing requirements and a declaration that they have a Tax File Number. Carers will be given a Child Care Provider Number which must be quoted when issuing receipts for child care payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To address the privacy concerns of parents and care providers, the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley has been consulting with the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me stress that at no time will parents or providers be required to give details of their actual tax file number to the HIC. All they have to do is state whether they have a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registration form for care providers will require a declaration that the care provider has a tax file number. If a carer provides a tax file number, the Health Insurance Commission must not record the information. Carers who advise that they have a tax file number will be given a Care Provider Number which they must quote when issuing receipts for child care expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families will be required to substantiate their workforce status and the birth dates of their children. Families will have the option of allowing the Health Insurance Commission to use Medicare enrolment details to verify birth dates of children. Families will register with the Health Insurance Commission and be issued with a Family Registration Number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families will be able to claim the rebate by mail or in person at one of 240 Medicare offices around Australia, in a similar fashion to the Medicare rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will mean they will be able to get the rebate immediately across the counter. This arrangement will not only be familiar to many families, it will reduce the need to establish a separate service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To enable the Health Insurance Commission to begin preparations for the Childcare Rebate, the Health Insurance Commission Amendment Act 1993 was passed during the Autumn sittings earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is committed to enabling parents to fulfil both their work and family responsibilities by ensuring that quality child care is affordable and accessible. The Childcare Rebate is a central part of that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will now add a few brief remarks to the second reading of the Childcare Rebate Bill 1993, as agreed. Firstly, this is a very appropriate time for this bill to be introduced as this is children's week. Secondly, it is also very appropriate because this is an election promised made and an election promise kept. The child-care rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense in earning an income. The government, in recognising that, does not intend to means test the rebate because it is like all other expenses associated with the earning of an income&mdash;they, too, are not income tested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This child-care rebate, taken with the other child-care initiatives, means that Australia becomes the first nation to put together a coherent and integrated program which caters for the needs of working parents. We recognise in Australia the importance of women having the opportunity to participate, particularly in the labour market. This child-care rebate contributes to that package of child-care measures to allow women real choices when it comes to work and family. In summary, we accept the reality that child care is a crucial support to the labour market and to labour market participation and recognises that it is a cost necessarily incurred by parents in the earning of an income. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 20 October 1993, the Senate referred eight Bills relating to the wool industry to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for consideration and report. These Bills reflect many of the recommendations and conclusions contained in the report of the Wool Industry Review Committee, which was chaired by Professor Ross Garnaut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills establish two organisations. The first organisation, to be known as Wool International, will assume responsibility for discharging the $2.28 billion debt and disposing of the 3.9 million bales in the stockpile, currently held by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. The second organisation, the Australian Wool and Promotion Organisation will be responsible for generic wool promotion and wool research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee held a public hearing last Friday, 22 October 1993, and received oral evidence from seven organisations and two individuals. The Committee was particularly pleased that Professor Garnaut made himself available, not only to give evidence to the Committee, but to participate in a round table discussion with other witnesses and members of the Committee. The Committee also received twenty submissions on the Bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the majority of the Committee outlines many of the issues raised at the hearing, particularly the fixed disposal schedule and the role of Wool International, as provided for in the Wool International Bill 1993. The Committee's report recommends to the Senate that the eight wool industry bills be agreed to without amendment. However, the Committee also urges the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to consult fully with the industry on the further development of Wool International and to give further consideration to the Government's position on the future funding of wool promotion. I should indicate that the document that I have just tabled includes a dissenting report from Senator Woodley.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like some assurance from the minister that, as the old provisions are in effect being left in place, he will issue instructions that the report be published by the Anti-Dumping Authority before the minister makes his or her determination. The problem arises that once the minister has made the determination, it can only be overturned by court action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that has arisen in the past is that many of the reports from the authority have contained wrong or inadequate information on which the minister has then made a determination. The applicants in the anti-dumping action were precluded from drawing this to the minister's attention because time simply ran out. The only course of action open to them would be to go to the court. The provision as its stands, `as soon as practicable', in reality meant very often after the minister made his determination. This is why I prepared the amendment that the report be published at the same time as it is given to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the opposition saw fit not to support me on that and the government indicated that it would not support such an amendment. So we are left with the status quo, with the old position, and that is unsatisfactory. I wonder what comfort the minister can give me in assuring me that the spirit of the legislation, that phrase `as soon as practicable', will actually be observed by the authority?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">(5.24 p.m.)&mdash;Senator Spindler has spoken to me privately about this matter. I cannot give the categorical assurance that Senator Spindler would like. I am only in my first six months in the job on Customs and the Anti-Dumping Authority and am still coming to terms with dealing with 40-page reports about the whole procedure which technically is extraordinarily complex. However, one of the things I have quickly come to realise is that whichever way one jumps in relation to these reports, invariably someone will challenge and make complaints if they are on the losing side of a decision. Therefore, I am very cautious at the moment in making any commitment such as Senator Spindler seeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the reports come from the Anti-Dumping Authority at the completion of its inquiries, I shall try to deal with them as expeditiously as possible, so that the time I sign them is about the same time they are being distributed to the public. However, if Senator Spindler wants to set in concrete the situation that, before I sign and agree to the initial report from Customs or to the authority's report, they are released and circulated, that means that people will lobby me not to sign or they will put information for me to argue the case that I reject the authority's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the issue that there is much more chance that the minister will be challenged in the court about why he made certain decisions. Then he will have to explain that company A, B or C came along and disagreed with the information. It then comes to the stage where the minister would have to argue that he has rejected information provided by the authorities for which he is responsible&mdash;namely, Customs and/or the Anti-Dumping Authority&mdash;after they have gone through a process of investigation, et cetera, and that he has taken advice separately from a company which may feel it is being hard done by in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging by my limited experience so far, I would say that is somewhat of a Pandora's box. In my assessment of what Senator Spindler raised here in the chamber today, it would mean that there would be much greater emphasis on trying to convince the minister to overturn either Customs' initial report or the Anti-Dumping Authority's report later on, rather than relying on a process that this parliament has established with very clear-cut legislation about a transparent process. On balance, I would rather stick with the transparent process laid down in the legislation than try as a minister to second-guess before I sign or am lobbied. I think that would open up another argument about the political pressures, lobbying by sectional groups and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this issue is as clear-cut or as advantageous as Senator Spindler may say it is. I am not saying that because I wish to avoid hearing representations or arguments. I hear them anyway because people who feel aggrieved by reports lobby all the time to have a re-hearing and so on, which is a process that is available under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I cannot give Senator Spindler the assurance he would like, I think that in the circumstances the wording `as soon as practicable' is reasonable. The authority, the bureaucracy itself, very much would like me to make it clear-cut. That is why they put the suggestion to me that it only be released clearly after I have signed it so that there is no doubt, which has some merit in my view in making the process very clear-cut. However, because of the views in the Senate, we are not proceeding with that. We are staying with the status quo. If Senator Spindler asks me the same question in six months, I may be willing, with a bit more experience, to chance my arm on some of this. I warn anybody that dealing with dumping inquiries is not a game for new players or for people to do things off the cuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each decision that one makes substantially affects industry, investment and employment one way or the other. Senator Spindler knows that because he has argued the case here so often. But I think any minister of the crown has to be very careful about that responsibility. I take on board what Senator Spindler says. I will discuss it with my officers in the Customs Service and the Anti-Dumping Authority. I cannot give the honourable senator the categorical assurance he needs, but I do take on board what he has said. </PARA>

It is not so much giving them a chance to lobby the minister; it is giving them a chance to put right wrong statements or wrong information that may be part of the report from the authority. Firstly, I wonder whether we should cut that off or force people to go to court. Once the minister has made a determination, the only way to do that is to initiate court proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as the Customs Service is concerned, it does it as soon as practicable and does not wait for my signature. As I understand it, determinations have been made available before I have actually signed them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, recently&mdash;I know this to be a fact&mdash;I had the experience while visiting Devonport, Tasmania, of finding that a very significant customs report on paper dumping had just been published the day before&mdash;before I had even seen it. As a politician and minister for customs, I would have been very happy to be in Devonport announcing it myself. But the process took its normal course before I even saw the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Anti-Dumping Authority, as far as I can recollect, by and large, does wait for me to sign. I would not want to be held absolutely to that. But, from my recollection of six months, the authority puts them to me for reading and signing before it releases them. Of course, I have the option not to sign a dumping authority. I have not refused to sign any; I have not rejected any so far. Again, the consequences of rejecting a report by the Anti-Dumping Authority would probably mean that I, as the minister, would very rapidly be in court trying to explain why I rejected the authority's report. As far as I can recollect&mdash;and I cannot be absolutely exact on it&mdash;Customs gets a determination out as soon as it can, irrespective of the minister's position, and the Anti-Dumping Authority, by and large, publishes or circulates it after I have signed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler raised the question&mdash;as he would know, I am sympathetic&mdash;of lawyers and people having to go to the courts to get rectification of something they see as an error in the report and which they would like to get fixed, if they could, before going to the legal expense of taking recourse in the courts. Again, I think that is a reasonable point. All I can say is that is one point to which I am sympathetic because of my experience on the Senate cost of justice inquiry. I will raise that with the officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if we try to give people the opportunity to check the draft report, so to speak, I suspect there will be some hooks in it.

Senator Margetts has been talking about such things as satellite sensing and surveillance. Overwhelmingly the biggest market in the future within our own region is for quite benign civil application of such technology. For example, the remote detection of changes in sea levels will be done by satellites with sensing equipment developed first of all for a military application. There will now be a spin-off and this equipment will be used to do something that I would think the Greens from Western Australia would be very pleased to see; that is, monitoring for environmental reasons such things as the height of the oceans, land degradation and changes in the use of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I understand the principles the Greens argue for and their opposition to defence expenditure. But it is not all beer and skittles; some very good civilian spin-offs are being developed. We will have an application to develop Australian industry and create Australian jobs and Australian skill.

I would have thought it would be clear by now to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) as well the opposition that the cold war has ended, that there is supposed to be a new world order and that we are supposed to be turning swords into ploughshares. I would have thought it is not beyond the wit of our government and of our industries to start with the civilian uses of high tech rather than use that spin-off as a pretext for engaging in weapons manufacturing and arms peddling. The lack of morality in that stance has been well and truly established over the centuries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to delay the committee, but I have to make a couple of further points, particularly after Senator Spindler's contribution. I find it a little strange that Senator Spindler, who consistently argues for government intervention and support to develop industry, refers to the fact that the range of industries that are listed are definitely involved in defence. All the industries have civilian application and all provide work in Australia and employ Australians. However, Senator Spindler believes that this industry has to be wound down and that people have to be removed from it because the Cold War has ended. I certainly agree with Senator Spindler that the Cold War may have ended, but for the sake of public security there is still a need to maintain a sufficient defence force for Australia. Future consequences, which we cannot judge at the moment, may change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a modest defence force in Australia that is adequate for our needs. Part&mdash;not all&mdash;of the computer bounty is defence related and exists to help us have a self-sufficient defence force. What I find particularly strange is that the Australian Democrats have argued for a decade or more that they want a neutral position for Australia in defence matters and that we should not have any alliances. If that position exists, one then has to argue for a strong defence force because one will have no international alliances. An independent defence force would be needed to show the Australian people that we could completely defend ourselves against all contingencies without our having any alliances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats is the last party in here which should be criticising a bounty system that is encouraging the development of Australia's defence industries because, if anything, it fits the Democrats' long-term defence policy. If one took the Democrats' policy to the ultimate by getting rid of all alliances, we would need to have these sorts of high-tech industries so that we could have an independent defence force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great interest to Senator Spindler's comments, which were generally about industry development and an interventionist role. I may disagree or agree with aspects of his argument, but on this aspect I do not think he ought to get his fingers jammed in the door by saying, `Let's knock all this over because it is contrary to the Australian Democrats' defence policy which envisages an independent defence force for Australia'. That policy needs the development of these industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His comments were generally against his own philosophy of developing Australian high-tech industries with government encouragement and development. I would have thought that, if he was going to attack us, he would have said that the bounty is not big enough for these computer industries, rather than that it is too big. Again, I emphasise that these companies do not get the bounty if they do not comply with the requirement that the equipment has to be made in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the chamber we have had, for good, sound taxation policy reasons, a strong attitude against the retrospective application of tax laws. But this government, anxious to rip the last dollar out of the taxpayers' pockets, decided in this regressive budget&mdash;designed particularly to hurt most the poorer paid members of our community&mdash;to impose a retrospective tax on both accrued long service leave and accrued annual leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago the government was forced by the reality of numbers to abandon its tax on accrued long service leave, but nevertheless it refused to take the hint and fought on to try to sustain its proposed new retrospective tax on accrued annual leave. I am pleased that the reality of the numbers in this place has finally brought it to heel and that ultimately it has had to accept the request of the Senate and, therefore, has abandoned this tax.

The government has had to respond to the numbers in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the bill that included the government's intention to extend the fringe benefits tax in a way that would have detrimentally affected the tourism industry without any real research as to whether there was an abuse which needed to be countered at all, which was the interesting thing in that regard. We would support avoidance measures, but the government had not done the work and it came along with this astonishing notion that people were being subsidised to take more expensive hotel beds in lieu of salary. It did not make sense. When the government was asked to justify it, we found that it had not thought it through. It was just another revenue producing measure, but the government had also made a mistake in that it was unlikely to produce the revenue it had anticipated. The government has had no choice but to take that one away and rethink it. I doubt whether we will ever see it again because, I think, quietly, it recognises that it was not a very smart idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs capital injection to build its tourist infrastructure, particularly as the Olympic Games approaches. What government in its right mind would impose measures that would have the contrary effect of reducing the incentive to put capital into speculative, as it always is to some extent, major capital infrastructure for tourism? These tax measures were not properly thought through. The third measure was the one that I started out with which was the retrospective taxation of accrued long service leave and accrued annual leave. The government has now been forced to back away from both of those as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an exercise where at least the Senate has been able to fulfil a useful function and, to some extent, bring this government to heel. There is no doubt that we would have liked to have done it to a much greater extent. We were very anxious to defeat 1.4 per cent of the government's revenue in these taxation packages. There is no doubt about that because the government did not seek the mandate that it should have at the last election and as Senator Schacht's leader in this place, Senator Gareth Evans, said in this place in 1981 in relation to our sales tax bills, `It is legitimate that we oppose them because you did not seek a mandate at the last election'. Not only did the government not seek a mandate but also it lied to the Australian people about its taxation intentions. We, therefore, had every right to oppose those taxes. If we could have persuaded the minority parties in this place to support us, we would have defeated them and then Australians would have been even better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would they have been even better off? Because the regressivity would have been overcome and because taxes on business&mdash;taxes that will be a disincentive to growth of business, investment in business and, therefore, the production of jobs&mdash;would not have been allowed to go ahead. But we were unsuccessful, I regret to say, in persuading the minority parties. To that extent, we only got them part of the way but at least the parts that I have mentioned are worthwhile changes and I am pleased that ultimately the government has had no choice but to therefore accept the request. </PARA>

In particular, the Commonwealth is concerned that most States and Territories have not yet introduced the complementary legislation which Heads of Government agreed would be necessary to give full effect to their July 1992 agreement on the National Vocational Education and Training System.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments provide that, if the Commonwealth Minister determines that a State or Territory has not met its obligations under the 1992 Heads of Government agreement, the Minister could direct ANTA not to pay any, or only a limited amount, of Commonwealth funds to that State or Territory. This new power is tied explicitly to the provisions of the Heads of Government agreement and could not be used by the Commonwealth to impose additional requirements on the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In introducing this legislation, there is no intention to undermine the ANTA arrangements and there is no criticism of the operation of ANTA itself. Indeed, the objective is to ensure that the ANTA arrangements are put on a firm footing by ensuring that the States and Territories meet their obligations from the outset. For this reason, the legislation provides that the new power to withhold funds would be available to the Commonwealth Minister only until the end of 1995. There would be no ongoing power for Commonwealth intervention in the allocation of funds through ANTA.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes an amendment to the National Health Act 1953 to complement amendments made last year to the nursing home benefit payments scheme by the National Health Amendment Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is related to the Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 and should be read in conjunction with that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health Amendment Act 1992 was enacted to address inequities in the recovery of unspent Commonwealth nursing home benefit when a nursing home is sold. These problems flowed from a quirk in the legislation which meant that amounts of unspent benefit were not legally characterised as debts to the Commonwealth. Where a nursing home proprietor accrued a liability and sold the nursing home, that vendor could not be pursued for the money after the sale. The purchaser became liable for that amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Commonwealth nevertheless had a statutory duty to recover such amounts, they could only be recovered via an offset or ongoing "negative fee loading" to the approved daily nursing home fee and, by extension, the amount of Commonwealth benefit payable each month. This sometimes resulted in the purchaser acquiring a home subject to a liability accrued by a former proprietor. Although the industry was well aware of these arrangements and usually made appropriate provisions in contracts of sale, problems still occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health Amendment Act 1992 addressed this situation by providing that amounts of unspent benefit were characterised as debts recoverable from the vendor on sale. It contained a number of key measures to support its purpose, including a requirement for vendors to give 90 days notice of a sale. This period of notice enables the vendor's claims for Commonwealth benefit, books and records to be examined so that, prior to completion of the sale, a fair estimate of any overpayment can be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, these changes only apply prospectively, applying to benefits paid after the commencement of the National Health Amendment Act 1992 on 1 July 1993. Benefits paid prior to the commencement of that Act are not subject to its provisions and the pre-existing system of recovery by fee loading continues to apply in respect of benefits paid up to 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two bills tabled for consideration in the current sittings together allow for the debt recovery measures to extend prior to 1 July 1993. The Nursing Home Charge (Imposition) Bill 1993 imposes a "charge" on the vendor of a nursing home on sale, equal to the amount of any benefit unspent by the nursing home up to 30 June 1993. The National Health Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 sets out the administrative arrangements for the collection and recovery of such amounts from the vendor on sale of a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This latter bill also provides that where the Commonwealth holds monies in trust for the benefit of the vendor pending completion of an investigation of the nursing home accounts, and on completion it is found that money is repayable to the vendor, the Commonwealth is liable to pay interest at commercial rates on the amount repayable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures complement those in the National Health Amendment Act 1992. They provide, effectively, that amounts of unspent benefit paid prior to the recent prospective amendments, are recoverable from the vendor as debts on sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health Amendment Act 1992 received the support of both the nursing home industry and the coalition, as expressed in the House by the honourable member for Bradfield, Mr Connolly and in the Senate by Senators Newman and Patterson. Those who spoke did, however, express a concern, shared by the industry and the Government alike, that there was a need for those measures to be applied prior to 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Health Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 addresses that need by complementing the National Health Amendment Act 1992 to augment the protection already given to the rights of purchasers of homes, provide a more equitable system and enable the Commonwealth to recover unspent moneys in a more timely manner.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this evening the Senate was debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 which deals with five separate social security matters. First, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to give effect to the government's election promise of a senior's health card. This card will be available to retirees with incomes below the part pension threshold who are not eligible for the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose this beneficial initiative but notes that the government has postponed its commencement until July 1994. The Australian public ought to be reminded&mdash;and I will continue to remind older Australians&mdash;that they were promised during the election campaign that the card would commence in April 1994. So yet another promise of this government has been broken. Older people were promised to be taken out of the taxation system by 1995 if they were on a pension. That promise was dismantled five days after the election because of some feeble excuse of the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins. In fact, the opposition believes the government knew before the election that it would not meet that promise. This is yet another promise that was broken after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the government has given no adequate reason why it needed to postpone this promise. It also should be noted that the coalition's extension of the pharmaceutical benefits concession card in our policy entailed a more generous income test with higher cut out incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for foreign income to be taken into account in the income test for family payment from January 1994.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this bill, foreign currency conversions will be undertaken fortnightly rather than quarterly. An advanced pharmaceutical allowance for the chronically ill will continue until the end of 1994. The coalition supports all of these quite reasonable initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most contentious change in this bill is the decision to include certain employer funded fringe benefits, namely, motor vehicles, housing loans, school fees and private health insurance in the income test for family payment and the parental income test for Jobsearch and Newstart allowees aged under 18. This initiative, which is due to commence on 1 January 1994, is based on the premise that taxable income is not always a fair indication of disposable income because it includes a range of non-monetary benefits for which employers pay fringe benefits tax. The planned income test will apply when the total annual fringe benefit exceeds $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main bone of contention in relation to this provision has been its application to the Australian defence forces. Members of the defence forces are eligible for rental subsidies and low interest housing loans. It is contended by representatives of the forces that these benefits are compensation for remote postings and frequent dislocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also argued that defence personnel are underpaid and that this provision will result in a further reduction in their standard of living. In response, the government claims that defence personnel are not a special case and other professions are in a similar position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When considering this contentious proposal it is beneficial to examine the history of these social security payments. It was the Menzies Liberal government that introduced child endowment in 1941. Senators on this side of the chamber should be justifiably proud that their Liberal predecessors had the foresight to introduce such an important financial recognition of the costs of raising a family. It was also another Liberal government, the Fraser government, which in 1976 replaced the child endowment with a non-income or assets tested family allowance system. The current family payments system, which comprises a basic family payment which has replaced family allowance and an additional family payment, is both income tested and assets tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main rationale for imposing these incomes and assets tests is the fact that in a needs based system of assistance finite revenue resources should be targeted to those families which are in greatest need. However, it is equally important in a needs based system that people with equal financial needs receive equal financial assistance. This is the principle of equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become very apparent, both in the family payments system as well as in other payments such as Austudy, that the current income and assets test do not ensure that the finite cake is distributed equitably. People with notional incomes that are sometimes well above the cut out limits or thresholds are able to receive assistance because these notional incomes are not taken into account in the current income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has recognised in its welfare policy that if Australia is to continue to pursue a needs based system of assistance then that system should be effective in ensuring that assistance is targeted to those who are most in need. With this initiative, the Labor government is belatedly recognising the fact that some people have been able to circumvent its family payment income test because it does not take such notional benefits into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence, the coalition is in favour of the initiative generally because it will provide a better targeted needs based family payments system. However, its application to our defence and police forces is an entirely different matter. In both cases, the application of this provision would affect housing related assistance provided by the beneficiary's employer. However, in neither case could such assistance be reasonably considered to be a fringe benefit. On 2 May 1986, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, who was then the Treasurer, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has over the years been a very strong movement towards the remuneration of employees&mdash;especially higher income earners&mdash;by fringe benefit packages which allowed income tax to be avoided on substantial parts of the overall remuneration. So called tax-free perks came to dominate salary package negotiations and packages were openly advertised in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no possible way that the housing assistance that is provided to our defence and police forces could be considered to fit the ex-Treasurer's definition. The defence and police housing assistance is certainly not confined to higher income earners, nor is it an attempt to avoid tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, we were talking about people in the defence forces and the police forces. Most importantly, there is absolutely no way that assistance by the provision of housing could be considered to be a `perk' in that normal meaning of the word. On the contrary, in both the defence forces and the police forces such housing related assistance is compensation for what we would call job-peculiar hardships that these employees must endure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that if any service person or police person was asked whether he or she would prefer to live permanently in one place without the constant burden of dislocation, the answer would be a very loud yes. I believe that this is the test that must be applied when deciding whether non-financial assistance is a fringe benefit or merely compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the defence forces and police forces, it is obviously compensation&mdash;but do not just believe me. The specific goals of the government's own policy in relation to housing for the Australian Public Service and the Defence Force include, firstly, compensating personnel for housing related disabilities consequent upon frequent relocation where this is required as a condition of service; secondly, providing adequate accommodation for personnel who are required in the course of duty to reside in locations where suitable alternative accommodation is not available, or who are required for essential operational reasons to reside at Defence Force or APS premises; thirdly, minimising financial disabilities of personnel required to relocate frequently, which are due to interregional differences in housing costs; fourthly, providing that an APS or Defence Force member not be out of pocket from reasonable expenses incurred in changing houses; and, fifthly, minimising housing related detriment to morale of personnel and families when personnel are required to relocate frequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The common theme that runs through each of these specific goals is the fact that such payments are compensations for conditions of service endured by the person who receives the payment. This fact was reiterated in the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence force members are required to serve, when, where and as required, often in the most hazardous circumstances . . . Family moves are regular, sometimes seemingly random and frequently stressful . . . The ethos of service remains paramount.</PARA>
<PARA>While the concept of service, in the context of this provision, is secondary to the overriding fact that these payments are not fringe benefits but are compensatory in nature, it nevertheless figured strongly in the evidence provided to the Senate committee by the police representatives. Senior Sergeant O'Gorman's evidence is very telling. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are transferred to a remote or disadvantaged area, which is usually where the highest majority of our people are provided with housing, you have no choice about where you live; you will live in the house that is attached, sometimes physically attached to the police station where you will perform your duty. You are usually operating in areas where you are the lone police officer, or one of two.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same address he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the police officer is away from the residence or away from the station performing duty . . . the police officer's partner or spouse is required to remain at the residence/police station and continue the operational functioning of that police station.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have liked to have said this to the Greens and the Australian Democrats. Senator Woodley is here, and I would like him to listen carefully to what Senior Sergeant O'Gorman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When people are arrested and placed in cells, the cells are usually in the yard of the police residence, usually within 20 metres of the house. The incessant abuse and the type of abuse that issues from those cells should not be inflicted on anybody. Police officers themselves can deal with it, but the families are required to deal with it. The families are required to feed these people and attend to their needs if the police officer is absent, and these are the families that this legislation is asking to pay a higher level of tax for the `privilege' of serving in those sorts of areas.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not a fringe benefit. We are saying that it is compensation for the fact that they have to live in those places and also that their families have to deal with the sorts of things that Senior Sergeant O'Gorman was talking about. It is obvious that the application of this initiative to the housing assistance that is provided to members of our defence forces and police forces is a significant departure from the normally accepted definition of `fringe benefit'. In the committee stage, I will be moving to remove both the defence forces and the police forces from the relevant definition of `current employee' in the bill. This will have the effect of precluding the application of this fringe benefit income test from assistance that is totally compensatory in nature. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Social Security Act contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 before us today will impact in five areas. Firstly, they will make foreign currency provisions more responsive to market exchange rate fluctuations. At present, the exchange rates used in assessing overseas income for the purpose of determining pension entitlements are adjusted four times a year. With the daily fluctuations of the Australian dollar against other currencies, this system may not give an accurate indication of a person's entitlement. This bill proposes to have a new exchange rate for each nominated currency to be determined each and every pension payday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats acknowledge the problem and accept this proposed change. My only concern with the move is that in response to the overseas income adjustments, a person's entitlement may need to be adjusted fortnightly. My concern is that this could lead to an absolute barrage of letters of advice going out to people. As anyone who has been a social security recipient would tell us, the number of letters they receive can be phenomenal. We hope this measure does not exacerbate this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second amendment in this bill seeks to extend the period of payment for the advance pharmaceutical allowance for a further 12 months to 31 December 1994. While I understand the number of people taking advantage of this up-front payment facility is relatively small, for those people it is a valuable allowance and the Democrats support its extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third amendment seeks to ensure that foreign income is included in the income test for family payment. I understand that this amendment is necessary to apply to those cases where there may be one parent who is a non-resident for taxation purposes working for an overseas company and being paid a high salary. At present, this salary is not being taken into account in assessing eligibility for family payments. The Democrats support this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The three measures I have just mentioned&mdash;the foreign currency provisions, the extension of the advance pharmaceutical allowance and the inclusion of foreign income in the family payment income test&mdash;are all measures the Democrats agree with, and I do not intend to go into them in any further detail. I would, however, like to spend some time discussing the remaining two changes; that is, the inclusion of fringe benefits in certain social security income tests and the introduction of the seniors health card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will be aware, the issue of inclusion of certain employer provided fringe benefits in a number of social security income tests was the subject of an inquiry conducted earlier in the week by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The underlying issue which was the subject of the committee's considerations was whether or not taxable income is really an adequate measure to use when assessing a person's eligibility for certain social security allowances. The bill before us today seeks to include certain employer provided fringe benefits in the income test for family payment and in the parental income test for those aged under 18 applying for jobsearch allowance or sickness allowance. The Democrats support this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of these fringe benefits reflects the recommendation of the 1992 Chapman report on Austudy, and a similar change to that which we are now discussing for social security will shortly be effected to Austudy through regulations. The argument behind these changes is that, by including such benefits, we get a better picture of people's real income level and their need for government assistance. Under the current system of income testing, some recipients have real incomes which would normally exclude them from eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits to be included under this legislation are employer provided motor vehicles, loan benefits, school fees, subsidised housing and private health insurance. The value of these benefits to a person, and to that person's partner, will be added together and that amount which exceeds the $1,000 `free area' will be counted as income in the social security income tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary focus of the community affairs committee's considerations was to decide whether or not it was justifiable to include the benefits I mentioned before, particularly as they apply to service families and to police, in these social security income tests. The committee received representations from various service groups and the Police Federation of Australia and New Zealand. These people argued that there is a distinction between fringe benefits and specific conditions of service and that the rental subsidy provided to our service families and police is not a fringe benefit, but rather a condition of service which partially compensates for the disadvantages and difficulties inherent in service life. In particular, we are talking about the operational need for postings to various locations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats understand these arguments. However, we believe the overriding issue that needs to be considered is  people's ability to meet living costs and their associated need for government assistance. At the moment, the income cut-off for basic family payment is $64,938 per year with $3,249 for each additional child, combined with an assets limit, exclusive of the family home, of $600,000. These figures will be reduced next year to $60,000 and $550,000 respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the inquiry the Department of Social Security indicated that it believes the majority of Defence Force personnel&mdash;about 70 per cent, I believe&mdash;to be affected by this change would be in the position of losing their basic family payment; in other words, those for whom the inclusion of fringe benefits will take their income above this $60,000 a year limit. This seems to be a large number of our defence personnel earning just short of $60,000, which surprises me somewhat. I am not sure that I agree with the assumption the department used in arriving at that figure, but I will leave that to one side for the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income cut-off for maximum rate additional family payment, and the health care card that goes with it, is $20,950 a year with an additional $624 allowed for each extra child. The allowance begins to cut out at around $25,000 with an additional $3,800 allowed for each extra child. So a family with three children is allowed an income of around $36,000 a year before its additional family payment is withdrawn totally. The Department of Social Security estimates that around 30 per cent of defence families affected will see a change to their additional family payment entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's dissenting report on this issue makes much of the fact that certain allowances received by defence personnel and police are paid as a result of various conditions these people work under. The Democrats have no argument whatsoever with the need to provide such allowances. The issue at stake here, however, is whether the allowances should be included in determining a person's eligibility or need for government assistance through various social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here I want to reply to Senator Patterson who asked me to listen carefully to the police evidence which she quoted. I can tell Senator Patterson that I found the police evidence very unconvincing and I am aware that in some parts it was simply inaccurate. I have personal experience of this, for my daughter was married to a policeman and I have lived in many of the towns which were quoted as having substandard accommodation for police. Although I have quite a deal of sympathy for defence personnel, I must say that I do not have the same amount of concern for police, even though I acknowledge that they, too, suffer some hardship. It is a pity that the police evidence presented was not as convincing, for me at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not alter the principle that people living side by side in the same town, whether it be a provincial city or a remote country village, ought to be treated equally in terms of social security benefits. In this instance, the proposed Greens' amendment does not help much either because the inequity between people would still exist. Although the Greens certainly catch up more people in their amendment, there are still people left outside, and even more left outside of the proposed opposition amendment. The principle with which we agree is that people should be treated equally when making an assessment for these payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Senate one or two examples. I visited the town of Woomera in South Australia. The proposed coalition amendment would say to us that civilians living in Woomera and service personnel living in Woomera should be treated differently in assessing their need for basic family payment and additional family payment. As was indicated in the government's paper on this issue, although the Greens catch up a number of other groups in their amendment, there are still people left outside such as the clergy. I certainly would not want to say, `Well, let's include them too', because I believe that the same principle applies, and that is, we ought to treat everybody in the same way on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems I have with the Greens' amendment is that it is so hard to assess the same kind of evidence presented on behalf of the people they have spoken about because most of the groups did not appear. In the teachers' case there was only a written submission and, in any case, the principle of equity remains. The Democrats have given much consideration to this issue and we believe that it is justified to include these allowances for assessment of the level of basic family payment and additional family payment and the other issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that the Democrats believe that the overriding consideration in this issue is identifying the best means by which to determine a family's need for government assistance. In this regard we believe that a family receiving a fringe benefit is indeed better off than a family not receiving a similar benefit, and as such we support this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to spend a little time on the final change proposed in this bill for it relates to the Australian Democrats' long held concern for self-funded retirees. From 1 July 1994 all people of age pension or age service pension age with an income below the pension cut off point will be eligible for a seniors health card. The legislation before us today will provide holders of that card with concessional pharmaceutical benefits and hearing aid concessions, and legislation to follow soon will provide card holders with certain dental and optometry services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has estimated that around 200,000 people will qualify for the card, including many who have been previously precluded from pension eligibility on the grounds that they are holding too large a level of assets, even though those assets may have been yielding only a very modest income. Self-funded retirees have often been behind the eight ball in this regard due to the level of the assets they hold. Those assets are funds that these people have put away throughout their working lives in order to provide for themselves in their retirement. What may seem like a high level of assets is in fact the fixed sum these people have to live off for the rest of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value for these people of their assets, while sometimes seemingly large, is seen purely in terms of the level of income generated by those assets. Of course, as a direct result of this government's policies, many self-funded retirees have had their incomes more than halved in the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a seniors health card is in accordance with the Democrats' long held and often espoused belief that retirees on the same level of income as pensioners should be entitled to the same benefits regardless of the source of that income. The Democrats recognise the uniqueness of the situation these people are in and have always argued that self-funded retirees on the same level of income as pensioners should be entitled to all benefits available to pensioners on the same level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been part of our aged persons policy for many years to extend the fringe benefits currently available to age pensioners to all retired people who have the same level of income as those pensioners who qualify for the concessions. As such the Democrats would not only provide these people with health cards but also with the public transport concessions, reductions in telephone and electricity costs, as well as car registration fees and household rate concessions that age pensioners are able to claim. Further, we would extend the existing age pensioner tax rebate to all retirees, provide a savings incentive in the tax system by paying a rebate on the first $1,000 of interest received by all taxpayers, including self-funded retirees, and would be looking to increase the tax-free threshold from its currently low level of $5,400 to a more reasonable figure of around $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independent retirees have the same needs as pensioners and to treat them less favourably is clearly unfair and acts as a disincentive for people to provide for their own retirement. The need for equity in this area becomes even more crucial as we are now moving into a period when almost everyone will be involved in superannuation. The Democrats welcome the seniors health card, but urge the government to consider extending those benefits even further. </PARA>

That is in contrast to the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. While he was not prepared to give any money to the defence forces, at least he stood up for them against the Left-leaning members of his cabinet. Mr Hawke saw that the defence forces were not reduced to impotence in the way that they have been under the present incumbent, Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is proposed here in the bill has caused huge morale problems in the Australian Defence Force.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heart of this matter is the abdication of leadership. The defence forces turn on leadership.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Patterson has dealt with this bill very eloquently, and I do not propose to recount the argument that she has put forward. I want to deal with the part of the bill that deals with fringe benefits as applied to the ADF. It is very clear that the government meant the ADF to be included because the definition section of the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`current employee' means: . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)a person who is otherwise in the service of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory (including service as a member of the Defence Force or as a member of a police force). . . </PARA>
<PARA>Most of the things I am saying, of course, apply equally to the police forces. Why were the defence forces included in this? Quite simply, it was a shoddy, money-grubbing exercise&mdash;in exactly the same vein and mind-set which led to the cutting back of the allowances to the troops in Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government misled the troops in Cambodia. It called for volunteers and got 150 to stay behind for five weeks in the belief that they would be paid the allowance of $65 a day tax free under which they had served their 12 months. The day after the main contingent left&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;the allowance was cut back from $65 tax free to $40. Why? It was as a result of money-grubbing and the government's attitude of cutting the defence forces all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What fringe benefits does the Defence Force get? The government clearly states that such benefits are employer provided&mdash;motor vehicles, housing, loans, school fees and private health insurance. If one goes back to the days when the Prime Minister was Treasurer, one sees that he said income received as a fringe benefit was `one of the most rutted tax shelters and the most untouchable income of all.' He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has over the years been a very strong movement towards the remuneration of employees&mdash;especially higher income earners&mdash;by fringe benefits packages which allowed income tax to be avoided on substantial parts of the overall remuneration. So-called tax-free perks came to dominate salary package negotiations and packages were openly advertised in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA>It is impossible to reconcile that with the members of the ADF. For a start, the government never gave conditions of service to the ADF as a tax shelter. That is nonsense. They are there as a form of compensation. Secondly, the great majority of service personnel who will be affected by the inclusion of these conditions of service as fringe benefits for the purpose of the social security family payment income test are not in any circumstance high income earners. Finally, Defence Force personnel do not negotiate salary packages with the government. Is the government really saying to the Senate that it created tax havens for members of the ADF?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By doing what it is proposing to do, the government is reneging on its obligation to compensate Defence Force personnel and their families for their conditions of service. That comes about because the conditions of service under which the Defence Force serve really are unique. It is quite wrong for Senator Woodley to preach a level of equity. I will come to that argument later, because members of the Defence Force are not senators; they are not members of parliament; they are not civilians in any sense at all. In 1989, the government put it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conditions of service are the elements of ADF remuneration that recognise, in a tangible way, that the profession of arms is a unique profession. Specialist allowances recognise special skills, and other allowances make up for disadvantages or difficulties inherent in service life, most of them clustered around the operational need for postings.</PARA>
<PARA>So the benefits that the members of the defence forces are paid are compensation for what they do, particularly for the turmoil of being posted from one town to another. I was deputy chairman of the defence subcommittee which did an investigation into personnel wastage in the Australian Defence Force. One of the passages in that report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conditions of service thus should encompass not only pay and allowances but also a comprehensive range of compensation relating to family and social issues, superannuation, hours of work, housing and operational privileges.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite wrong for the government to turn on the defence forces in the way it has in this bill, particularly in relation to their rental assistance. Housing at a subsidised rent is provided to Defence Force families who have no choice at all but to go where the government posts them, to fulfil the needs of the nation as they are seen from time to time. That is why it is classified as a condition of service, a point that the government itself has made time and time again. As far back as 1986 the government made it clear that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . defence housing is a very important condition of service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is full of such references. The defence committee report that I quoted from earlier states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few Public Servants would move more than several times in a career because of employment-generated requirements, whereas for Service men and women at least 10 moves in 20 years is common and 15 or more not uncommon.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the witnesses we had before that inquiry spoke of being in 11 houses in 16 years, having one child attend five primary schools in five states and in Papua New Guinea, and another attend four schools in four states in five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whoever in the bureaucracy thought this proposal up has to be an ignorant fool. It is to the eternal disgrace of this government that it went along with the proposal. It is quite absurd to penalise defence families for accepting compulsory postings imposed on them by the government through the Department of Defence. Another statement of the government in 1986 was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, operational questions are involved in the need to provide adequate housing. Those operational questions are related to a requirement to make absolutely certain that the armed forces are readily available in circumstances in which they may need to be deployed and are also readily available for the purpose of training.</PARA>
<PARA>It is in the interests of the armed forces and the government to ensure that its members are adequately housed. One of the great successes of this government in its 10 years in office has been setting up the Defence Force Housing Authority, which has provided excellent accommodation for the defence forces and has lifted them from the squalor of the run-down state housing commission estates. But in addition to penalising them for their rent subsidy, the government is going to penalise them for their educational allowance, which is, in the words of instruction 0501:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . payable to assist in defraying costs incurred when, on long term posting within Australia, a member wishes to leave his or her child in his or her present school or education system in order to prevent serious interference to the child's secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA>The allowance for defence dependents is considered a condition of service. Finally, the Hamilton report of 1985, commissioned by this government and entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Supporting Service Families</EMPHASIS>, stated that education was the most worrying problem for most of the groups Hamilton spoke to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at what the government is proposing, we have to ask: where is it going to end? Are we going to see the health service provided to troops as a fringe benefit? Are we going to see troops going overseas to Somalia or Cambodia having their free service of a medical examination and inoculation classified as a fringe benefit? Where will it end? What happens if they get treatment for an injury? Is that a fringe benefit of their service?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government initially suggested that around 4,000 Defence people would be affected by this legislation. The revised figures from the Department of Social Security put the figure at around 7,000 families, and those figures may well be conservative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A woman phoned me to talk about her own family. Her husband is a private at level six and they have four children under 10 years of age. To survive, this family gets almost $7,000 of assistance from the Department of Social Security, assistance given in recognition of their parlous financial state, a level of assistance which will be significantly cut back by this proposal. This family, which receives an income below the Australian average, gets a family payment of $90.60 per fortnight, additional family payment of $151.10 per fortnight plus rent assistance, a health care card, medical assistance, medications, access to a dental clinic and assistance with heating and gas bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this bill is passed, this family will lose most of its additional family payment. If they move to another area of Australia where the housing rents are higher and therefore their fringe benefits will be regarded as more substantial, they will lose the additional family payment with the health care card. This is really an absurd situation. Because of the low salary the government pays the lower ranks, they are dependent on family income support measures from Social Security to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal briefly with the amendment that has been proposed by the Greens. The opposition is not prepared to support it because it widens the group and, unfortunately, at this stage, on the matter of definition the Greens cannot assure us precisely which groups it will apply to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great interest to the Democrat case being put by Senator Woodley. His theme was that it all should turn on a person's ability to pay, to meet their financial outgoings. I can tell Senator Woodley that there are over 7,000 members of the Australian Defence Force who cannot pay their way. We have a large proportion of people in the Australian Defence Force who are way below the average income earnings for Australians and they cannot survive. They will leave the Defence Force if this bill goes through. </PARA>

It is all very well to talk about equality of people before the law and beat the drum about equity, but the defence forces are not equivalent to civil servants. They live in a highly authoritarian society. They give up a lot of privileges when they put that uniform on. They are under orders the whole time. At the end of the day, the men and women of the Defence Force die on orders and there is no civilian, least of all Senator Richardson, who will die on orders from a superior officer. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cabinet decided on 18 August 1993 that these provisions were to apply to all and the ADF is a part of the wider Australian community. Therefore no such exemption would apply to the ADF.</PARA>

I know there was a measure in Fightback that was far harsher than the one that we are debating tonight&mdash;far harsher. In fact, in Fightback, the family payment income test would take account of `total remuneration'. Total remuneration includes superannuation and all fringe benefits, not just the categories that the government has included tonight. There was no mention of a $1,000 free airing. No families, none, not one defence family was deemed to be excluded from this measure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I contemplated all of that, these things came to mind. Firstly, if the savings were $250 million and three times what we are asking for tonight, either there were going to be some extraordinarily harsh measures that would wring from every defence family, every family possibly connected with a fringe benefit or within a mile of it, an enormous percentage of their income, or Fightback's figures were shonky&mdash;or I suppose, as another possibility, a combination of both. But, either way, where was Senator MacGibbon? Where was his voice of protest? How often did it ring through the corridors outside the opposition party room?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg Senator Patterson's pardon. I could probably take offence at that if I were in a different frame of mind. Senator MacGibbon has talked about the salaries of defence families and how all this money will be ripped away from them. In the submission put to the committee, to which Senator MacGibbon referred earlier, from the Service Families Association, concern was expressed about the situation of a soldier with three children, earning $27,000 and receiving $167.94 in additional family payment per fortnight and a health care card in 1993, being likely only to receive basic family payment in 1994. Senator MacGibbon exaggerated this position; he was saying that such a family would lose everything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that situation the family's total additional family payment entitlement was, according to that, something like $4,366 per annum. To lose all of that through this measure, the family would need to be receiving almost $10,000 per annum in assessable fringe benefits. This family obviously was not receiving the maximum rate of additional family payment which would have been $185.70 per fortnight for a non-renter, much more than the quotient that Senator MacGibbon mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the family does not receive the maximum rate, they would be entitled to a health care card only under a savings provision which has applied since January 1993. If that were the case, they would retain their health care card in 1994 if they remained eligible for even some additional family payment. So Senator MacGibbon's example and his suggestion that they would lose all of their additional family payment stands up to no analysis whatsoever. It certainly cannot be concocted from anything that is before us tonight in the bill. I find that quite disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the incomes of Defence families and compares them across the board, one can make some interesting comparisons. A private with about six months of recruitment and initial employment training receives an annual salary of $26,711, including service allowance but not including other benefits such as for housing or health and additional compensation if on peacekeeping, hazardous or active service. People who join the Public Service after three years of tertiary study have starting salaries of between $20,677 and $25,550&mdash;far less than what we are talking about for a private. Corporals in the defence forces earn an average of $32,000 per annum. The average earnings of working families receiving additional family payment at June 1993&mdash;and that is really the critical point here&mdash;were $17,652 per annum, and 85 per cent of them had incomes less than $25,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pretty hard to work out how this is some terrible punitive measure wreaking havoc upon Defence families. It stands up to no analysis whatsoever. It certainly gives the lie to the statement of Senator MacGibbon that this measure forces Defence families to join `the poor of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While mentioning that Defence families are disadvantaged because they are frequently posted around the country to lots of different places, it should be noted that they do still manage to find a way to own their own homes, because the rent subsidies that they get can be quite generous. In fact, the 1991 census suggests that Defence Force families have a home ownership rate of around 71 per cent, which I think honourable senators would agree compares pretty favourably to the national average for families of 74 per cent. The figures are virtually indistinguishable. I cannot see how that disadvantage of which Senator MacGibbon speaks actually applies. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment gives effect to the argument I put in the second reading debate that the defence forces and the police ought to be excluded from the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2).

In our negotiations behind the scenes we said to them that we did not believe we could support the amendment being extended to the teaching service, an emergency service or a public works service, given the way that they had put the draft amendment. One draft amendment read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4, page 3, proposed subsection 10A(2), paragraph (c) of the definition of "current employee", omit "including service as a member of the Defence Force or as a member of a police force", substitute "other than service as a member of the Defence Force or as a member of a police force or as a member of an essential community service including a teaching service, an emergency service or a public works service".</PARA>
<PARA>The Greens had another amendment which broke that amendment into two forms. We were not sure which one they were going to move. In the event, they moved neither of them. We had indicated to them that we could not support that amendment because we did not know what the definition of a teaching service was and we did not know what they meant by an emergency service or a public works service&mdash;or, really, what were the extent and the ramifications of that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens said to us, `If you can't support that, we really can't support your amendment'. I hope they will come down and support our amendment. They included the Defence Force and the police force in their amendment, agreeing with part of our amendment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not see good evidence in the committee. As a previous speaker from the Australian Democrats said, there was a 1 1/2 page submission to the committee from the teaching service which really was not very convincing. We have not had people coming to us from any of the other services saying that they had had a problem. We have had people from the Defence Force and the police force bringing their point of view and also presenting submissions to the committee. That is what led the senators on this side to put in a minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems odd to me that the Greens senators cannot come to a decision tonight to support our amendment, which includes part of their amendment, and to address the concerns that we have about the Defence Force and the police force.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These additional family payments are defined in the government's propaganda&mdash;the leaflets that it put out&mdash;as a welfare benefit paid to parents in `low paid work' to help support their children. We know that at least 3,400 Defence Force families are being required to seek these additional family payments because they are in low paid work and it is necessary for them to basically support their parents. I regard that situation as disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this legislation, the government is putting those Defence Force families in an even worse position. That is the issue that the minister has to address.

That is what justifiably enrages Senator MacGibbon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are prepared to give their lives in service to our community in, as Senator MacGibbon said, a unique form of work&mdash;they are certainly at a unique risk&mdash;put themselves in a position that requires many relocations during service life.

In all these circumstances it is not surprising that some service allowances and other compensations have been provided in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past six years, there has been no adjustment to service allowances. This government has not pursued a case before the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal to adjust service allowances. They are therefore well out of date. That is one reason why, at the lower ranks of the Defence Force, they are now finding themselves paid at a level that the government, as I said, describes as low paid work. In that situation, additional family payments become critical to them. Yet this government, by its decision tonight, is removing from them some of those benefits, and that is what we object to. </PARA>

I had intended to speak in the second reading debate, but what I want to say relates to a specific clause in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. When I first read the provision, I thought it was a misprint. Any reasonable person reading this bill&mdash;a man on the Action bus travelling home to Tuggeranong&mdash;would assume that this was a misprint. I will read it out so that the Senate knows what I am referring to.

<PARA>If we are talking generally about persons in the service of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory&mdash;government employees&mdash;we would have expected the definition to say just that: `a person who is otherwise in the service of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory'. But it does not; it goes on to refer to two specific classes of government employees&mdash;defence personnel and police&mdash;who we know get sent all over the country and quite frequently have to move into pretty poor accommodation. The definition includes, within brackets, those employees. We are entitled to expect that the definition would say, `a person in the service of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, excluding service as a member of the Defence Force or as a member of a police force'. I put it to you most seriously, Mr Chairman, that that is what most people would have seen. We would expect Senator Patterson to come in here and assist the government in correcting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it extraordinary to sit here tonight and hear the minister tell us that the police and defence force personnel are so well paid that they are effectively ripping off the system by getting some compensation for the dislocation they suffer.

Perhaps the minister does not realise that a set of curtains in one police house does not always fit the next police house.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that the Greens of Western Australia have had considerable difficulty with this issue and with the opposition's amendment. Initially, our view was to oppose the amendment and support the government on the basis that if one group is excluded from the measure, then every group in the community should be excluded. While we felt that the argument that defence force fringe benefits are an offset for frequent moves required of members of the forces, we knew that the same could be argued by teachers and police officers, and by clergymen and people in private industry, such as bank employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extremely persuasive arguments of an opposition adviser encouraged us to look at this issue more closely. It is true that, while we felt it was inequitable to single out a particular group of people to support in terms of this amendment, maybe there was a hope of broadening the base if we voted on this amendment and then sought to vote for the other categories later on. We have changed from that position. It is not that we do not believe that this amendment carries weight. We do understand the argument that this is a compensation rather than a fringe benefit; that people who are transferred or relocated to remote areas do suffer disadvantage; that their children suffer disadvantage from changes in schooling and other changes that are required. We have not been able to ascertain with complete confidence whether it is mainly the lower paid groups within the defence forces and the police force who will be penalised by this removal, or whether it will apply right across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We prepared an amendment which we hoped we could support within the opposition's amendment; that is, we felt happier about not singling out two particular groups for an exclusion from this measure when there were other groups that could equally claim all those disadvantages of relocation, poorer income level, and dislocation of children in schooling. I accept Senator Patterson's criticism of our proposed amendment. I believe that our amendment required a more thorough definition for those opposite to be able to understand the point we were making. I thank them for looking closely at our amendment. I understand that, at this late stage, it is difficult for them to support our amendment, which had such a wide definition. To clarify the position for the chamber, this is the reason why we have not moved our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, we do not feel very comfortable in supporting the opposition's amendment which is piecemeal in that the issue of equity in these circumstances extends well beyond defence and police force personnel to teachers and to other sectors of the work force. There is a very good argument for why we should not support an amendment which singles out two professions&mdash;defence and police&mdash;for special treatment. We would be willing to support an amendment to make the whole measure more equitable. We put the government on notice in respect of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that the government sees that this measure will cause the agencies to re-work salaries and wages for their personnel rather than provide relocation allowances&mdash;subsidised housing in a manner which quarantines them from assessment. We repudiate that argument. We believe it is spurious. The government may be attempting to use an illegitimate mechanism to exact change.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that there are significant costs for people who, by virtue of their jobs, are required to move around the country. An adjustment of people's wage and salary structures to offset the costs of moving may compensate these people satisfactorily, but this may then force them to lose their additional family payments anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not intend to agree to the opposition's amendment, but we will be happy to entertain any amendment proposed to any future social security legislation bills which addresses the wider equity issues and which includes these two particular professions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very sad to hear Senator Chamarette speak. I wish I had a chance to speak before her. Maybe then I could have explained the ins and outs of the position, which I do not think she quite understands. Before Senator Chamarette came to the Senate and when the employment situation was very much better in Australia, there was a very serious problem of wastage in the Defence Force&mdash;that is, people leaving. These were people in whom an enormous amount of money had been invested in their training. They were leaving because of low morale and the wages structure. As Senator Hill mentioned a few minutes ago, they had gone through a long period when their allowances had not been brought up-to-date and where person management generally was inadequate and needed attention. The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, led by Mr Manfred Cross, brought down a most excellent report which contained a large number of recommendations aimed at improving the morale in the Defence Force and trying to do something to retain these expensively trained people in Australia's service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has changed since then. We now have massive unemployment. We also have a Defence Force full of people who are very unhappy but who no longer have the option of getting out. A lot of the training that they undertake is very specific to the Defence Force and is not easy to transfer into civilian life. My experience is that many civilian employers are suspicious and lacking in understanding of what skills Defence Force personnel can offer them when they transfer across to civilian employment. So it has not been so easy for them to get work as it was when employment prospects were much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I listened to the discussion about compensation. It is very important to understand that such things as the secondary education allowance and subsidised housing, et cetera, are very much forms of compensation for the requirements of Defence Force service. In saying that, we also have to remember that the government has been trying to deal with artificial salary packages where people get a much lower income but where they get side benefits in lieu of income. It is a way of avoiding taxation, of course. I do not have a problem with attempts to deal with that, provided they distinguish between artificial salary packages and measures such as the ones in the Defence Force which were in place long before this rash of artificial salary packages became fashionable and were genuinely put into place because of compensation needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was the shadow minister for defence science and personnel, for several years I tried to pursue the granting of the secondary education allowance&mdash;through asking questions in estimates committees and in the chamber. It is monstrous that tens of thousands of Defence Force families, many with secondary school children, are required to move at least every couple of years. Sometimes in a service lifetime, families might face up to 30 moves. We should think about what that means for a family. Taking all that into account, only 90 secondary school children who are the dependents of service personnel are eligible for these secondary education allowances. That is the way in which the criteria are written and it is the way in which the eligibility is determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no suggestion that it is any kind of artificial contrivance. It is very hard to get that secondary student allowance. It is very helpful and very important for children who do not transfer well from one school to another and whose educational aspirations are going down the drain because of the difficulty of making new friends, the difficulty of adapting to new schools, having problems with new teachers and curriculum changes. These things which we as parents understand only too well, we try to avoid for our own children. But only 90 children in the whole of the defence forces are eligible for that allowance at any one time. One cannot describe that as any kind of artificial contrivance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some talk earlier about housing of Defence Force personnel. I would like Senator Chamarette to understand that from the time the Defence Housing Authority was set up by the government, the opposition has given its solid and consistent support, as I hope Senator Richardson would acknowledge. At every step of the way the opposition has supported that organisation. We have tried to see that it was properly funded and we have encouraged the improvement of Defence Force housing. Successive governments have neglected Defence Force housing and I am delighted to see it improve, as it definitely has. But there is still a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsidised rents have two justifications: firstly, there is still a considerable amount of substandard housing that Defence personnel must live in. I say `must' advisedly because frequently they do not have an opportunity to choose. They may be posted to an area where there is little or no real alternative, either because of cost in the private sector or because of lack of availability of rental housing in the private sector. So they are left with substandard housing. That is one reason why we would have subsidised housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the teachers, the clergymen and the bank people to whom Senator Chamarette just referred can choose whether they go on postings. They can knock them back or they can actually apply for them. Defence Force personnel rarely have that luxury. They are under discipline and they must go if the service says they must. That is a very important distinction because that is the basis on which some of this compensation is payable. It is payable because they do not have control over their lives or the lives of their families in relation to where they live, how they live, in what they live and the amount of family time they have or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That discipline on Defence Force personnel is extremely extensive and requires people to spend long periods absent from their family. Frequently young children are being raised with the father&mdash;sometimes the mother&mdash;away for quite long periods. These are things which we should be considering in trying to determine whether these are artificial contrivances designed to avoid income tax, which, after all, is what I thought fringe benefits tax was meant to be about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the minor parties will give further consideration to this issue. It is pretty serious at the moment because people cannot march with their feet out into civilian life and take another job if their present arrangements do not suit them. They are slipping behind in terms of pay and allowances compared with the wider community. They are not unionised&mdash;they do not have a union to speak for them. All they can do is bide their time until the economy improves and they can leave the defence forces. That is not really in the nation's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of my speech, we have invested a massive amount of money in defence personnel. We have an interest in keeping them there if we can keep them happy in the service. I think this is the most pettifogging, mean-spirited measure. I find this quite incredible when the government knows full well that it adopted all of the recommendations in the joint committee's report. To some extent, it has implemented them; it has dragged its feet on others. But to turn around now and allow this measure to go through is undoing any good work that it did in trying to improve the conditions of service for Defence Force personnel. I am sure Mr Manfred Cross would be appalled to know that the work that went into that massive inquiry and the excellent recommendations that came out of it, which were adopted by the government and the opposition, are starting to be unwound by this sort of nonsense that we have before us now that has hurt people and worried people so much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the minor parties have received the sort of correspondence that I have received on this issue. They well recognise that I am no longer the shadow minister responsible for this area, but they know that many of us on this side of politics are very concerned for their well-being and we have done what we could to try to save them from this measure which the government, in such an incomprehensible and mean-spirited fashion, is imposing upon our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I beg the minor parties to think again. They will not have it rubbed in their faces if they recognise that this is a special case. These people are receiving compensation. It is not an artificial device. They are under discipline in their lives, which changes the situation very dramatically compared to most other people who receive what might otherwise be designated as fringe benefits. </PARA>

The minister cannot extrapolate from the generalities of what we proposed under social service conditions and say that, therefore, we would have done that to the ADF.

The point that we have been making all along is that it is a question of equity between different groups of people. The fact that the opposition is going to knock out the police and bring to us an amendment which just mentions the Australian defence forces does not alter the problem of equity between the Australian defence forces and other groups of people.

I hope she has listened to the arguments that we have put to her this evening. It seems odd that if she does put up an amendment with which we cannot agree, she would sacrifice the Defence Force and police force members because she cannot get all of her amendment through. That will have to wait for a later day. I leave the debate at this point with my amendment on the table and I presume that we will be dividing on it in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate has been well canvassed, and I want to address only one point which harks back to Senator Hill's contribution, which seems so long ago now. He was saying that this was a measure which acted primarily against the lower paid and, similarly with Senator Newman, from the way she described the purpose of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, there seems to be a misunderstanding as to what the bill is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill affects those whose incomes are already at the margins of family payments; that is, either the basic family payment or the additional family payment. That is what it is about. By exempting the first $1,000, those receiving relatively less in fringe benefits are obviously less affected. In fact, the Department of Social Security expects a far greater number of families to receive the basic family payment, the cut-off of which is about $60,000, than those who have additional family payment, which starts to phase out at about $21,000. In fact, 22,000 of the total of 31,000 families who may be affected come from the basic family payment category, something which seems to have been lost in tonight's debate, but does put it in some perspective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main effect of the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1993 is to overcome the Commonwealth's self-imposed deadline to ensure that the sale of Qantas proceeded by December 1993. I guess the purpose of the deadline was to show the market the bona fides of the government in relation to the programmed selling of Qantas, which has now been somewhat of a saga for at least five years. Indeed, with the prime motive of this bill being to delay the final sale of Qantas until June 1995, it seems as though the saga will continue for at least the next couple of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has put forward a number of reasons as to why the sale has been delayed. The main reason, which we have no reason to doubt, is the state of the world aviation market broadly. The other reasons in more specific terms are the state of Qantas's profitability, the bedding down of the merger between Australian Airlines operations and Qantas's international operations and, finally, the bedding down of the 25 per cent stake in Qantas which was sold to British Airways for just in excess of $600 million. These are the range of reasons why the sale has yet to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition would argue that a number of the objectives of privatisation are not being met, and that the sale price and a number of other excuses made by the government are not the central core considerations of a government when it is seeking to privatise an entity as large as Qantas. If the government is waiting for the market to ripen for such a sale, what happens come June 1995 and we are in a position where international airline profits are still bubbling along in a subdued international market of high competition and where the world stock market has yet to fully recover from various uncertainties about the international aviation market? If the government decides then that it is still not appropriate to sell Qantas, we may well be coming back here and passing yet another bill to delay the sale again. Let us hope that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that if we are always second-guessing the stock market, always second-guessing the state of the international aviation market and not proceeding on some other clearer objectives of privatisation, then the potential investors in that sale will begin to go off into other markets and wonder whether the sale will ever proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite sure that the new chief executive officer of Qantas, James Strong, who we are told sat at his new desk for the first time yesterday morning, will be very keen to see this privatisation proceed as quickly as possible. One of the main objectives of that privatisation has been ably communicated by such pro-privatisation people as the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe). He told the House of Representatives that one of the important considerations of the Australian Labor Party when it supported the sale of Qantas at its Hobart conference a few years ago was the need for capital expansion within the airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, an operation as large as Qantas cannot compete internationally in such a competitive and growing market if it is relying all the time for its capital requirements on the diminishing resources of the Commonwealth government on the one hand and borrowings on the other. Of course, running an international airline is a heavily capital intensive business. Capital items such as aircraft are hugely expensive, requiring masses of maintenance money as well as operating expenses. To rely on government funding and funding by borrowings is not a way to go when one is operating in such a competitive, cutthroat, international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for infusion of equity capital is absolutely crucial. I am sure that the new chief executive James Strong will be working very hard on a range of priorities. I am sure that one of them will be to ensure that Qantas is made ready for sale at the earliest opportunity. James Strong has returned from a corporate mission in New Zealand to turn around the ailing&mdash;that is a bit of a pun&mdash;the failing DB Brewing group in New Zealand into which he infused some of his undoubted management skills, and particularly his skills in getting people to work together as a team to achieve a corporate objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As probably the first parliamentarian who has spoken on Qantas since James Strong actually took up his appointment, I am sure that I say on behalf of all honourable senators and members that we wish him well in his new role as the chief executive officer of Qantas; that is, both in trying to maximise Qantas's involvement in the international airline traffic and more specifically getting Qantas ready for a successful sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst features of this government in terms of asset sales is its record. I am sure the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) and his advisers on this matter are getting well and truly sick of members of the coalition quoting the failure of the government's budget forecasts on asset sales. But I would imagine that the more times we relate an account of the government's failure of its sales programs, the more careful and strident the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) will be in trying to assess for annual budgetary purposes the projected income from sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than going over the annual figures, I would seek the indulgence of the minister to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> figures extracted from the budget papers which show the shortfall in revenue from the asset sales programs during the past five years. For example, in the year 1988-89 it shows a 24 per cent shortfall where the government forecast $700 million in income and received only $528 million; in the year 1991-92&mdash;a more recent year&mdash;the government set out to raise $625 million and indeed made a $302 million loss, which was a 148 per cent shortfall in that year; and last year&mdash;the most recent budgetary year&mdash;the government anticipated sales of $1.6 billion and received only $800 million, which was a 50 per cent shortfall. They are fairly unimpressive figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is reasonable for people to doubt&mdash;and let us all hope we are wrong for the sake of the budget&mdash;that the proceeds from this year's privatisation figures, which I understand are $2.4 billion, can be achieved. I think there is significant doubt in the marketplace, around this place and certainly in those of us in this chamber who are interested in privatisation, that $2.4 billion will be received. There is doubt that the sale of the Commonwealth Bank will be a success. It will raise a lot of money and of course the sale of the extra shares in the Commonwealth</PARA>
<PARA>Bank will help to make that figure look more realistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said on budget night that I would predict that the asset sales for this budget will fall short by about $1 billion. I very much hope I am wrong. I described, Mr Acting Deputy President, in words that you would understand that the $2.4 billion that the government predicts for asset sales includes what our friend David Stockman from the Office of Budget Management in the United States administration under Reagan described as the magic asterisk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Stockman was always perplexed by the way that Treasury officials in the United States would make forecasts for out year budgets and have these little asterisks on figures for projections. They were usually to do with growth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That leads to the next issue when it comes to considering privatisation, and that is, the use of the proceeds. This government continues to use proceeds for annual expenditures and annual revenues as is described in language that the public understands. It is very much analogous to selling the silverware to pay for this week's groceries. The coalition takes a very different stance to that. Our stance is that when we sell a national asset like Qantas the proceeds should be used to offset debt and, therefore, improve the budgetary situation not only in the current year but also in the out years as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Australia should learn from the experience of the Thatcher government, which this government so often compares the coalition to. One of the great criticisms of the Thatcher government's privatisation program is that it made some of the mistakes that this government is repeating; that is, it used proceeds for current expenditure. It sought to privatise government trading entities without seeking to enhance share ownership or have a better competitive environment&mdash;but, basically, it sought to sell things for the once off proceeds to help with the current year budget problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives which the coalition seeks for all privatisations are to enhance competition so that people get a better service, have more choice as to where those services can be derived, and better quality service from private sector provision of the service; and to have greater economic efficiency, which is a very important argument for the earlier privatisation of Qantas rather than the later privatisation. While the efficiencies of the marketplace are acting upon Qantas in a way that they cannot do while it is owned by government, it increases the international opportunities for Qantas. While it is restricted in its capital base the way it is now, while it is restricted in many of its management decisions and in terms of its share ownership, it does not have the full benefits of economic efficiency that privatisation would give it, particularly in the marketplace in which it operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, when it has that restriction on its capital base it makes it that much harder for Qantas to break into new markets. It just does not have that flexibility to quickly get new equipment, set up new marketing links and so forth, even though&mdash;and I stress this&mdash;Qantas has been extremely successful, given the restrictions that it has. It is very good at opening up new products and markets. But one wonders at what Qantas could achieve if it was a private body and, clearly, the government has made the decision that it needs to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have covered most of the issues that I wanted to cover. However, I wanted to raise&mdash;and it is a matter that I did raise with some people from the asset sales task force in a briefing I received this afternoon&mdash;the status of employee share ownership schemes within Qantas and a number of the other privatisations which the government is undertaking this year. The government has been, in its public statements, fairly quiet about employee share ownership schemes. One of the objectives of the coalition in privatising these Commonwealth-owned bodies is to ensure that the employees of those bodies can gain a significant stake in the enterprise by which they are employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite crucial, in maximising the performance of a company or a business, that all of the employees have a very real feeling that what they contribute to the business is very important to the success of that business. There can be no better way of achieving that than the employees actually having a share in that business. I think in a people business there could be no better example of a business that so much replies on its people as an airline business like Qantas&mdash;from the people who check in, to the people who service the aeroplanes, to the people who handle baggage, to all the in-flight service people and the pilots; all the people in the airline business are crucial to making the airline successful. To maximise the performance of the airline, it is clearly desirable for Qantas employees to have a significant stake in their own airline. They will, of course, work that much harder at serving their customers if they have that stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware from the briefing I received this afternoon that Qantas management is working very hard on coming up with an employee share ownership package. I was very pleased to hear that because the politicians who have spoken on this matter have yet to describe it. I do understand that the package that the Qantas management is discussing is one that will be very beneficial to the employees and therefore beneficial to all of us who are privileged to use Qantas for our international or domestic travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales process of Qantas and a number of other major government trading entities has become a bit of an international embarrassment for Australia. I certainly hope that the problems of bedding down the Qantas-Australian merger and the problems of getting Qantas's own books in saleable shape, are resolved very quickly. I would caution the government in waiting for a better marketplace to sell Qantas. The actual level of proceeds of the sale should be one of the minor considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine did a feature on privatisation&mdash;one of the features it runs from time to time&mdash;on 21 August this year. The feature article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the circumstances, two over-riding aims are usually involved&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is talking about privatisations across the world&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One is to shrink the state, in pursuit of greater economic efficiency; the other is to raise cash. These hopes are often in conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>When the article discussed the conflict between raising cash and increasing efficiency and competition, it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like nationalisation, however, privatisation works better in some places than others&mdash;and best of all in the countries that make efficiency and competition, rather than short-term revenue, their goals.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the lesson for this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will always be a temptation to wait for the perfect time in the market to sell Qantas for the best price, but if we proceed down the track and make the major objectives of privatisation greater efficiency and better competition, we will all be served better in the long run. That is why I genuinely say to the asset sales task force, the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) and the government more broadly that trying to second-guess international stock markets will be doomed to failure. Much greater minds than the Minister for Finance or the asset sales task force have come major croppers trying to second-guess the stock market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point is that the government does argue that one of the reasons for the sale is that the stock market in Australia has far too many floats on it at the moment. This is another reason why a sales program that has some definite end to it is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market is always looking at who is floating what. In the last few months there has been an enormous number of floats. There are something like 25 or 30 floats of varying sizes coming onto the market. If the market knows when Qantas is going to come on, then it will adjust the other floats to it. If the government keeps saying, `We will put Qantas on when it suits us', the market will say, `Well, the government is never going to make up its mind. We had better just go ahead with our plans'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in a healthy market for floating, as we have at the moment, the market will of course put more and more stock onto the equity market and there will never be a window for Qantas. Qantas is a large sale. The government needs to commit itself to achieving the objectives of economic efficiency and better competition and make the size of the sale revenue a lower consideration in its priorities. </PARA>

In December last year, when that act was passed, it was expected that the divestment of the Commonwealth's interest in Qantas would be completed by October-November of this year. The bill contained a provision that any of its unproclaimed sections would be repealed if they had not been enacted by 31 December 1993. The government has since announced that the initial public offering of shares will be deferred under 1994-95. In the absence of any legislation, the provisions intended to commence on dates on which 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the airline is sold will lapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are employee related provisions of the Qantas Sale Act which are planned to come in on the 50 per cent sale day. They `save' certain existing employee entitlements and rights arising from pre-sale service or else they remove airline employees from the ambit of legislation applying only to Commonwealth owned or controlled entities. It is necessary to do these things to protect employees. We support these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also interested to hear that Senator Campbell has made inquiries about employee share ownership.

The fact of the matter is that it is not a function of whether a business is government owned or privately owned. It is, as the opposition said, whether the business is run efficiently that is significant. It is not, therefore, an automatic connection that the only things that are run efficiently are those which are privately owned and privately run.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Member of the opposition ought to listen to their colleagues in New South Wales. They start with the theory of, `Let's get all these things off the books. They are an embarrassment sometimes if they are not making money' and then extend that to the others because of the philosophy that all privately run business has to be better. But in New South Wales the opposition's colleagues have thought twice about selling Elcom. They like the idea of having something which produces huge profits actually on the books as a revenue raising measure. They can use that revenue for other things of their own choice, which is what this federal government ought to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time for a big balance sheet on how we have measured the costs and the benefits of privatisation because I do not think we have done that seriously as a nation. All we see is outlays, money we have to find now. Why are we in that predicament? Because for successive decades Liberal and Labor governments have starved Qantas of the necessary capital injection. We know that and again we get to the end point where the most convenient solution is to sell it off, get it off the books, to say, `Don't worry about what it represents, don't worry about the whole argument of foreign equity and don't worry about stemming the flow of profits offshore. Don't worry about any of that&mdash;let's just get it off the books'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed to the lack of capital but another issue is, I think, the broad question of foreign ownership of Australian enterprises. Is it really in the national interest for six digit profit figures to go offshore? The question of limits of foreign ownership, which the Democrats raise regularly in this place, also applies in this debate about Qantas. Do opposition senators not think we could argue that something which is fully Australian owned and controlled is more likely to act in the national interest? I think it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas has very special role in the Australian psyche. It has been a major earner of foreign currency and this is something we welcome as one way of stabilising our foreign debt. One thing we do know is that a significant transfer of wealth occurs during the privatisation process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I approach this debate this evening with some degree of personal interest because I was employed by Qantas in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the time of my employment it was a feature of Qantas that its employees never considered themselves public servants. We were not classified as such because of a loophole involving the board members of Qantas being the only holders of shares. But we were very proud of our company. We were proud of the very high standards that Qantas was known for worldwide. Staff training was of a very high standard. We were highly regarded by the travel industry and performed a large servicing role for the Australian travel sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Qantas was also known internationally for the special care and attention it gave to carrying sick, disabled and young people. Our national airline does not gain a lot of profit from such a service. Passengers are not charged for the cost of providing proper, correct and advised care. However, that is the kind of service that Qantas provided. Qantas was very famous also for its very high safety standards. This, of course, was the position in the days when Qantas was not being asset stripped. I can only wonder how Qantas rates in these areas today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Greens do not support privatisation, we do not refuse to support the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill. This legislation does not alter the fact that Qantas will be privatised. We wish to flag clearly, since the government seems uncertain in its ability to hear what we say, that we oppose the privatisation of the basic social infrastructure. Industry is not good at ensuring equity; that is not a part of its purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government ownership of public infrastructure, education, water, power, communications, public transport and finance institutions or companies providing basic structure in a mixed market is designed to ensure that services are available in an equitable way and that the needs and desires of the community are represented. The only alternative to public ownership is strict regulation, as we find in the privately owned energy and communications industries in the United States of America. Private industry sets it own agenda; this is often not the agenda for the future that the wider community would wish. For this reason, it is important to support publicly owned service companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also wish to say something here about asset sell-offs: they may address some of the immediate problems of government, but assets are limited and will run out. In selling them off, we are selling off the Commonwealth's savings. It does not address the structure of the economy in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will support this amendment because in this case the amendment will have the effect of protecting the rights and conditions of employees, which are part of the conditions that will be extended. It may also allow for a more orderly and profitable sale of shares rather than a `fire sale'. We think the government may be right about delaying the sale, although the current market boom may not last. Certainly, the market has not been good, nor has recovery proceeded as predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by repeating that it is sad to see that the only standards we seem to value in such areas are profitability and efficiency in very limited terms. We should be concerned about the general quality of service and equity. I consider these to be some of the most important aspects that a national carrier should provide to the people of Australia. </PARA>

Of course the costs and benefits of privatisation should be assessed and assessed carefully; equally, the costs and benefits of not selling commercial assets owned by the government should also be the subject of careful analysis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not new; it has been stated since 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That point is reinforced by the fact that the sale proceeds of Qantas are estimated to be around about $1.8 billion to $2 billion. One should understand that the average monthly expenditure on social security in Australia in any given month is roughly $2 billion; so the sale of Qantas will pay for one month's social security. Therefore, the sale proceeds are only a small consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point relates to the economic benefits. A cost benefit analysis of the economic benefits of privatisation across the world has been done by bodies such as the World Bank. The World Bank found that in 11 of the 12 cases studied&mdash;countries such as Britain, Malaysia, Mexico and Chile&mdash;there were `big economic gains' and that across the world the efficiency improvements brought about by privatisation are in excess of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I want to make is that the coalition's agenda for privatisation is carefully considered, and carefully programmed and set out. It has been set out before each election, naming the bodies that will be sold and the specific years of those sales. It includes something like four or five items each year. We will, of course, issue again, before the next election, a manifesto setting out those sales. It is a well thought out program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 October the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> ran an editorial in which it criticised Senator Graham Richardson for expressing a view that the Queensland government policy in relation to the regulation of prostitution was incorrect. Senator Richardson's comment was made in the context of the fight against AIDS. The editorial implied that Senator Richardson should keep out of the affairs of Queensland. One part of the editorial, which was entitled `Local rules&mdash;Stick to your turf, Senator', read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . social regulation is a state matter. Senator Richardson's attempt to intervene is unwarranted.</PARA>
<PARA>Later the editorial went on to assert:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The governance of this country is&mdash;apparently to Senator Richardson's distress, but that is also irrelevant&mdash;substantially split by the Constitution into matters that fall within the purview of the Commonwealth and those which are administered by the states. This system is far from perfect. It is a system that is continually muddied by politicians who seem unable to remember which side of the fence they are on.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial also remarked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Senator Richardson is determined to worry about the extent of illicit sex and consequent disease, there are plenty of areas within his own federal portfolio upon which he can spend his time and effort.</PARA>
<PARA>The clear implication was that Senator Richardson should not comment on matters that are the responsibility of the states, even if he considers the policy pursued by those states to be at odds with what he as the federal Minister for Health perceives to be in the best interests of the nation's physical wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took issue with this stance of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. I thus wrote a letter to that newspaper suggesting that Senator Richardson had every right&mdash;indeed, an obligation&mdash;to speak out on matters relating to health and to make suggestions about shortcomings which he perceives in health related issues, even if this means commenting on state government policies. My letter to the editor ran as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How churlish of your editorial (The Courier-Mail, October 16) to criticise Senator Graham Richardson for offering his opinion that prostitution should be legalised in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Richardson is, after all, the Federal Minister for Health. As a conscientious Minister, he is concerned about the spread of AIDS and methods by which that spread may be arrested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is all very well for your editorial to suggest that there are delicate constitutional matters that should keep Senator Richardson at bay. But there is no evidence that State borders are barriers to the AIDS virus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a responsible Minister for Health, Graham Richardson is correct in commenting on what he regards are incorrect State policies and actions in the fight against AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By all means, argue against his propositions if you disagree with him. In this way, community debate can be fostered about policies to deal with a grave threat to public health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But do not suggest that he keep his suggestions to himself or air them only in Canberra. Senator Richardson's responsibility for health policy and delivery is a national one. If he did not make suggestions about shortcomings which he perceives in health related issues, he would not be fulfilling his duties as Minister for Health.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He certainly cannot be accused of being derelict in his duty towards the massive problem of AIDS and for that he should be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> saw fit to publish only the first and the last sentences of my letter&mdash;altering the last sentence, incidentally, so that it read as two sentences. This is what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> printed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How churlish of your editorial (C-M, October 16) to criticise Senator Graham Richardson for offering his opinion that prostitution should be legalised in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He certainly cannot be accused of being derelict in his duty towards the massive problem of AIDS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that he should be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA>So of 12 sentences in my original letter, two were published. The whole thrust of my argument was lost, and it appeared as if all I was doing was writing a brief comment to agree with Senator Richardson's view on prostitution. One wonders at the ethical standards of a newspaper which decides to print the first and last sentence of a letter to the editor and leave the other 10 sentences unprinted. Then again, apart from those professional journalists who work for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, I have never thought that ethics have loomed large in the ethos of this particular newspaper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to bring to the attention of the Senate an issue which relates to the independence and sovereignty of our nation. I think it is true to say that there is growing awareness and concern about the enormous enthusiasm of the ALP for UN conventions and UN committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, Australia's independence is being undermined by the government's action to allow UN committees dealing with human rights issues to involve themselves in Australian domestic activities. Secondly, these UN committees are already having a significant impact on Australian law. Thirdly, the UN committees themselves do not meet appropriate standards of independence and judicial process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the decision to allow UN committees to have a role in Australian domestic disputes is wrong in principle. I happen to think sovereignty is important and should not be compromised by international treaties without very good reason and, above all, without demonstrable benefit to the nation. Nevertheless, those who support Senator Gareth Evans's so-called new internationalism should at least insist that the UN committees meet the highest possible legal standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to my first point, Australia's independence, there is no argument, even from the most passionate advocates of UN conventions, that Australia's sovereignty is eroded by the government's decisions on UN human rights treaties. For example, Senator Schacht is an enthusiastic advocate of UN human rights treaties. He was the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade when it produced the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS>. This Schacht report pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been a tendency for the United Nations to limit national sovereignty. This evolution, therefore, increasingly demands a reconsideration of the principle of national sovereignty. United Nations conventions, now covering a wide range of activities, inevitably change the character of domestic institutions, affect domestic legislation and extend accountability beyond the usual domestic constituency.</PARA>
<PARA>Senators will recall that this is the same Senator Schacht who ceaselessly argues the independence line when promoting his other great passion of the need for Australia to become a republic. The problem with this argument, as far as our constitution is concerned, is that we are already an independent country&mdash;at least we were until the Hawke and Keating governments acquired a fascination with UN treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Act 1986, among other things, abolished appeals to the Privy Council. With all the rhetoric about independence, one would have assumed the last thing any government would do is involve foreign bodies in Australia's legal system. After all, it was Gough Whitlam who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . the High Court of Australia (must be) the final court of appeal for Australians in all matters . . . It is entirely anomalous and archaic for Australian citizens to litigate their differences in another country before judges appointed by the government of that other country".</PARA>
<PARA>In 1986, Mr Hawke's Deputy Prime Minister, Lionel Bowen, suggested that the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council reflected Australia's status as an independent and sovereign nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all these fine words, it took Labor five years to reverse the philosophy of the Australia Act. In 1991, the government ratified the so-called first optional protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which enabled Australians to take complaints to the UN human rights committee. In February 1993, the Keating government further opened the doors for Australians to litigate their differences before the UN by recognising the competence of two other committees&mdash;the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee against Torture&mdash;to consider complaints from individual Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe most Australians would not know that the government has taken these actions. If my recollection is correct, there was no debate in the parliament. No approval was sought from the parliament. What an irony of Australian history! The great advocates of UN human rights conventions were able to make major decisions affecting the legal system of this country without consulting the Australian people or their representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now to my second proposition. The willingness to involve UN committees in domestic activities is of major significance to our legal system. Senator Gareth Evans, when questioned about the significance of these decisions to open up Australian domestic disputes to UN committees, becomes, in my experience at least, often abusive and ends up arguing that the findings of the UN committees are only exhortatory and advisory. A number of points can be made about this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the UN human rights committee is having an impact on our legal system. We need go no further than the famous Mabo case. As Justice Brennan said in the case of Queensland v. Mabo:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The opening up of international remedies to individuals pursuant to Australia's accession to the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights brings to bear on the common law the powerful influence of the Covenant and the international standards it imports. The common law does not necessarily conform with international law, but international law is a legitimate and important influence on the development of the common law".</PARA>
<PARA>Justice Kirby, the President of the New South Wales Court of Appeal and a most respected Australian, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Several of the trailblazing decisions (of the High Court in 1992) were influenced by the fact that what Australian courts decide can now be scrutinised (and criticised) by the UN body (the United Nations Human Rights Committee).</PARA>
<PARA>These statements alone demonstrate the great importance of the decision to ratify the first optional protocol. Our highest court is already paying close attention to the fact that Australian cases may end up at the UN human rights committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other ways in which UN committee findings can be of great significance in Australia. For example, a decision of a UN committee can provide the basis for action by the federal government to override a state government. Once the committee gives a view that a particular complaint is justified, the government would have the power to act even if it related to a state jurisdiction. For example, under current political circumstances it would be untenable for the federal government to legislate to override the criminal law in a state. However, if the UN human rights committee were to publish a decision stating that Australia is in breach of its international obligations because of state legislation, the federal government would not only have an excuse to act but would probably be obliged to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Canadian experience with the first optional protocol is instructive and provides a pointer to what will occur in Australia. Canada signed the protocol in 1976. An analysis of the cases which have been heard by the human rights committee shows that their determinations have clearly had an impact on government policy in Canada. There is no reason to expect that a similar experience will not arise in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans must have expected that the decisions on UN committees would have a significant impact. Why else would he take this decision in the first place? It is disingenuous to pretend that the government has not taken a highly significant act in allowing domestic disputes in human rights areas to go to the UN. There has been virtually no attempt to argue the case publicly for this decision to justify why our legal system needed this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN committees are simply not appropriately structured to carry out a significant role in our legal system. If our highest courts are going to pay attention to the views put forward by the UN committees, surely we should at least insist that these committees have the standards of independence and due process that we require from our tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the UN is in need of major reform. Senator Evans and most observers have readily conceded this point. Nor should we forget that of the 185 nations that are members of the UN, 117 are classified by Freedom House as being either not free or only partly free. It is hardly surprising, then, that the UN committees concerned with human rights are also in need of major reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independence of the committees is compromised by their method of appointing members; the short-term nature of the appointment, with the option for reappointment; their dependence on the UN for funding; and the attitudes of some of their members. The procedures of the committees do not meet standards that Australia would want for high level tribunals. Critics have pointed to the fact that the short sitting times of the committees inevitably means that much of the work must be done by their secretariat. At times, I understand that there has been a failure to produce comprehensible reasons for a particular judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote some expert views. In a recent book edited by Professor Philip Alston entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The United Nations and Human Rights&mdash;A Critical Appraisal</EMPHASIS>, the activities of various UN committees are reviewed. On the issue of the membership of the human rights committee, one writer, Mr T. Opashl, has written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inevitably, however, independence is relative and varies with the backgrounds of the members and practices of their governments. It is not unique to this body that some experts seem to have been in closer contact with the authorities of their own countries than other members, if they have not acted directly under instructions; others have at the same time as their Committee membership been serving their governments in an official capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>Another observer, Louis Henkin, in a book entitled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age of Rights</EMPHASIS>, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is composed of independent experts but, as other bodies of international experts, some are not independent in fact but subject to substantial control by their governments.</PARA>
<PARA>It is hardly comforting to know that our High Court pays such close attention to a committee based so far from our shores. I suggest that Sir Owen Dixon would turn in his grave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar complaints on issues of independence have been raised in relation to the UN racial discrimination committee. I seek to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a short analysis of the membership of the UN racial discrimination committee and the tables which list the membership of the three UN committees concerned with human rights to which Australians can make complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Because a Committee member serves on a part-time basis, honorary basis, usually he must simultaneously maintain a separate profession. Only rarely do these dual roles create conflicts; judges, university professors, retired diplomates or diplomates dealing only with bilateral relations are unlikely to receive directives from their authorities with respect to their work on the Committee. However, for a minority of members, primarily those belonging to the permanent missions of States Parties at New York or Geneva, such conflicts can be significant. They may find themselves in the awkward position of having to disregard their superior's directives while at the Committee table. Clearly, it is incompatibly with the Member's solemn oath of impartiality if his attitude is dictated by a member of his country's permanent mission. Nevertheless, it seems that not all the States Parties attach the same importance to these proprieties".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members are nominated by their governments and elected by a secret ballot of the countries that have ratified the relevant conventions. So Australian human rights cases which go before the committee are determined by a membership which includes nominees from countries that have an appalling record in human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, there are government nominees from Cuba, China, Romania, Russia, Ghana, Nigeria, Peru, and Egypt, to mention just some of the countries. None of these countries could be described as free societies. Yet Mr Keating and Senator Evans seem to believe that it is appropriate that a committee so composed should have the ability to rule on human rights cases in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other function of the UN committees is to review reports from member countries about domestic human rights developments. I recently received a report from the government entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The ninth periodic report of the government of Australia under article 19 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination</EMPHASIS>. This report was presented to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the membership of which I have just referred to. The report seeks to demonstrate: firstly, how serious the problems of racial discrimination are in Australia; and, secondly, how effective the government is in dealing with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not pretend Australia is perfect. There is clearly more that we must do to assist disadvantaged groups. But compared to many of these countries whose government nominees are considering our record, Australia would be a gold medal winner in creating a fair and tolerant society. Nothing in this report provides any real sense of balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what Michael Banton of the United Kingdom, Carlos Hevia of Cuba, Ivan Garvalov of Bulgaria, Sangu Shuhua of China and Regis de Gouttes of France thought when they read this government report which quoted sources that `racist attitudes and practices (both conscious and unconscious) against Aboriginal people pervade Australian institutions'. Anyway, Australia regularly makes reports to this committee so it can check out our performance and ask further questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really beyond the pale that the Australian government reports and is answerable to such a committee. I wonder whether, in the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s, Billy Hughes, Jim Scullin, Joe Lyons or Ben Chifley would ever have felt they would have to report to the British Colonial Office on any matter in the way Paul Keating and Senator Evans report to the UN. Let me put a further proposition to the Senate: the affection that any pre-war Australian monarchist may have felt for the British Empire is nothing compared with the adoration that Senator Evans and Mr Keating feel for the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians must enjoy the highest possible human rights. Where human rights infringements occur they must be addressed quickly. That is why we opposed Labor Party initiatives such as the Australia Card and banning TV political advertising. We continue to oppose special privileges for trade unions and so forth. Indeed, Australia is in the forefront compared with virtually any other country, by any measure, on human rights. There is a high level of agreement between all parties on the major principles in relation to human rights. There is, however, inevitably controversy about human rights applications in particular circumstances, for example, the right to privacy versus the right to freedom of expression, rights of children versus rights of parents, rights of women versus ethnic rights, property rights versus community rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real question goes to how these judgments should be made between competing rights. Should the balance be determined by local courts or international committees? The balance determined by local courts in Australia will be affected by local social circumstances and mores. The balance determined by a UN committee may be different and quite alien to Australian society. Often very fine and sensitive judgments are involved in human rights cases. They are far better made, in my view, by a local body with an understanding of Australian society which is accountable to the Australian people. It is also important that decisions which have such a significant effect on the rights of individuals are made in an open court which follows fair procedures and gives full reasons for judgments, rather than behind closed doors and far from public scrutiny. The UN committees do not meet the tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it was a serious mistake to involve UN committees in Australian domestic human rights disputes. If our human rights laws and courts need reforming, the democratic way to do it is through our parliaments, involving our people and their representatives. The wrong way to do it is to address domestic human rights problems through the UN by opening up avenues of complaints to UN committees. </PARA>

I would not normally bother responding because Mr Dodd is such an irrelevance&mdash;a recent blow-in from Sydney to North Queensland. But following his efforts last Thursday, I simply cannot resist pointing out some of his more embarrassing inaccuracies. I had intended to speak for longer on the adjournment debate last Friday morning but, because of the way the Labor Party mismanages business in this place, I did not want to put anyone through the trauma of a long adjournment speech at 2.18 a.m. I will refer to some of Mr Dodd's more embarrassing inaccuracies. On 30 September 1993 he was reported in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as saying in the other place:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>As all honourable senators would know, I am not one to brag about what I do, but it might do Mr Dodd some good to check the parliamentary database before highlighting the lack of interest in local government which his Labor Party demonstrates in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been shadow minister for local government since April 1992.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly Senator Panizza would have spoken much more often about local government because he is a person who understands and has a genuine commitment to local government. If Mr Dodd seems to think that I have not spoken much about local government when I have spoken, in various ways, some 96 times, what must he be saying about his local government ministers who have spoken on a mere 18 occasions about local government since I have been the shadow minister?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following hot upon the heels of Mr Dodd's first inaccuracy that I do not talk much about local government is his claim that I am not talking to local government. Again Mr Dodd proves the old saying that if you are ignorant, it is better to keep quiet than open your mouth and prove it. Since my election I have personally visited over 300 of Australia's 915 councils in all the states, including just about every council in Mr Dodd's electorate. I have written to all councils. I have visited on several occasions all of the peak local government bodies in Australia in each state and I maintain regular contact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of months, I attended the Queensland annual local government conference and, on the weekend, I attended the annual conference of the New South Wales local government association. The week before, I visited the New South Wales Local Government Association executive for talks, then I went to Melbourne to talk with the Municipal Association of Victoria, and later I visited the Municipal Association of Tasmania in Hobart to discuss matters of interest with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So not only am I talking about local government; I am talking to local government. This helps me to talk about local government in an informed way, unlike like Mr Dodd, who is yet to make an informed comment on anything at all. I come to his third inaccuracy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One week ago Senator Macdonald was running around, again causing concern in the Far North, saying that SBS would not be targeted.</PARA>
<PARA>By that broken English, I think he meant that I claimed that SBS would not begin by the target date in Cairns. Once again, Mr Dodd has his facts wrong. I did issue a press release in Townsville highlighting the fact that certain areas in Townsville would not get SBS until a year after the rest of the city and this was because the government was not willing to pay the money this year to install the necessary two extra translators. I pointed out in my press release, and in questions in the Senate, that these particular areas&mdash;North Ward and the towns of Ayr and Home Hill just south of Townsville, where I live&mdash;were, in fact, the areas with the largest ethnic community and therefore the ones which, one would have thought, would get SBS first, not a year after everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking about Townsville. At no point did I mention Cairns or the Far North in relation to this issue in my press release. My press release did not even go to the Cairns media. I can understand Mr Dodd's embarrassing confusion with the Cairns media because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> is not one of the better Queensland papers. On 12 October it ran a story under the heading `Minister dismisses claims over SBS broadcasting'. It said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beddall said claims by Queensland Senator Ian Macdonald were shown to be wrong when raised at a recent Senate Estimates Committee hearing.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS> ran that article. I suspect it was touched up a bit by Mr Dodd, who is very sensitive. But it did not bother to ring me for a comment and did not bother to run what it said was the original press release, which was issued in Townsville, not in Cairns. I can understand why Mr Dodd is a fraction confused after what he read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cairns Post</EMPHASIS>. Nevertheless, Mr Dodd has his facts wrong yet again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Thursday in the House of Representatives Mr Dodd outdid himself with his inaccuracies by his reference to a complaint made by the Liberal Party to the Electoral Commission about the conduct of the election in various polling booths in Cape York. Mr Dodd claimed in the House of Representatives that I ran `a slur campaign' against Australian Electoral Commission workers. That was not the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use this opportunity to put on the record some of these low lights of democracy which were recounted in a press release issued by the Liberal Party candidate following the election. I will read from this press release to tell honourable senators some of the things that were complained about in this so-called democracy of ours. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statutory declarations obtained gave details of the following irregularities. At Lockhart River on at least 15 occasions, Liberal scrutineers saw voters place blank ballot papers in the ballot boxes, yet when the votes were counted in Cairns there were no blank ballot papers at all amongst the votes. Secondly, at Lockhart River electoral officials were clearly seen to be directing voters to vote Labor by pointing to the Labor box on the ballots as they were handed to voters. Complaints about this were ignored by the returning officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electoral officials at Lockhart River accompanied voters without invitation to the booths to assist them with their votes. Further, ballot boxes were not sealed at the Weipa South booth and were opened during the day to retrieve mistakenly placed absentee votes. Further, on four separate occasions, the returning officers' assistants at Pormpuraaw were seen as picking up blank ballot papers off the floor, filling them in and then placing them in the ballot box. The returning officer made no record of the complaints by the Liberal scrutineers about these particular incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On at least eight occasions the returning officers' assistant was seen escorting voters without invitation and filling out ballot papers on behalf of the voters. Again, complaints by Liberal scrutineers were not recorded. On two occasions Liberal scrutineers observed spoilt ballot papers being removed from a drawer and filled out by certain officials.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Pormpuraaw the returning officer was granted permission to photocopy 10 extra ballots. The returning officer said that these were invalid and elderly voters unable to come to the polling booth. Protests were made from Liberal scrutineers that such votes should be cast by postal ballots and that the ballots should not leave the booths. When the votes were checked in Cairns 13 photocopied ballots were counted at the Pormpuraaw booth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning officers at Weipa south were seen to be putting blank ballot papers into rubbish bins rather than retaining them and also returning officers were seen allowing ALP how-to-vote cards to be left on the official tables and in the polling compartments.</PARA>
<PARA>A series of statutory declarations were obtained to justify those complaints and they were all handed to the Australian Electoral Commission. Last Thursday in the House of Representatives Mr Dodd asked why the Liberal Party had not apologised. I will tell him why. There is no official apology from me or the Liberal Party because no-one, including the Australian Electoral Commission, has adequately shown that the statutory declarations made by our scrutineers are false. In fact, the investigation by the Australian Electoral Commission leaves a lot to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dodd then went on to accuse our scrutineers of racism, but he has provided no evidence whatsoever of what. He just threw some mud in the hope that some of it would stick&mdash;a disgusting tactic against people who have no means of defending themselves in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame that the honourable member for Leichhardt is so inaccurate in his comments&mdash;comments which few people take any notice of.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I very briefly note the concern of my colleague Senator Colston about the standards of ethical journalism in the newspaper to which he referred. I also note the comments made by Senator Kemp, who on one occasion was shocked to find that I said I thought he had made a very thoughtful contribution to a previous debate. He is more likely to be satisfied tonight because I did not agree with anything he said tonight. I thought it was a rather sad and dated 1920s contribution and I suppose I should not be surprised, but I was disappointed. It was an attempt to wish that the world was different and that international scrutiny is not upon all of us. It would have been a fine speech in the 19th century House of Commons and Disraeli would have listened with interest, but it is entirely irrelevant.</PARA></TALK.START>

I hope he is very consistent in that because I have seen some enthusiastic advocates of that practice on his side of the house.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prices Surveillance Authority has conducted regional fuel pricing investigations, and has observed that there are usually legitimate reasons why some markets have lower retail fuel prices  than others. In the PSA's view, price variations can, in the majority of cases be attributed to the normal operation of competitive market forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While differences between rural and metropolitan petrol prices can be expected as a result of freight costs, in the past year or so price variations have been, as the Honourable Senator suggests, exacerbated by the extent of discounting by oil companies at the wholesale level. The PSA influences petrol prices by endorsing a maximum wholesale price for each company, but it has no power to stipulate when, where or by how much oil companies should discount their petrol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Discounting has occurred mainly in major capital city markets, and certain strategic locations on highways, and has largely resulted from strong competition initiated by aggressive independents. Pump price competition can lead to reduced gross retail margins, increasing the pressure on oil companies to discount their wholesale prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulties inherent in attempting to narrow the city/country price gap are illustrated by events in late 1988, when Shell posted a state wide wholesale rack price which allowed for lower wholesale prices in country areas, thus transferring the benefits of city competition to non-competitive rural areas. In response, many retailers in the country simply increased their profit margin, denying country consumers the benefit of lower retail prices. Shell's subsequent wholesale pricing approach generally excluded country markets from such discounting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulatory attempts to eliminate price variations between  metropolitan and rural areas run the very real risk of eliminating discounting in the city, with no benefit to country people. In the Government's view this would be an unacceptable result. The Government considers that the most appropriate measures to address regional variations lie in preserving retail competition to the extent possible, through the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and in exerting pressure on oil companies through the Prices Surveillance Act, to adopt reasonable wholesale prices.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) A workshop of osteoporosis experts, convened by the Deputy Prime Minister and the then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, the Hon. Brian Howe MP, was held on 14 August 1992. One of the issues the workshop considered was the significance of osteoporosis in Australia in terms of its incidence and costs. The workshop reviewed available data sources and concluded that it was difficult to estimate accurately the extent of osteoporosis in Australia because of the lack of comprehensive national data. It was agreed that osteoporosis could affect up to one in three Australian women and a smaller proportion of men. It was also noted that two community-based studies which are being conducted would provide more direct estimates of the incidence and costs of osteoporosis in Australia: namely the Dubbo Osteoporosis Study and the Geelong Study.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. In the 1993-94 Budget, the Government has committed funds to improve access to bone densitometry testing through the provision of a Medicare rebate. As funding arrangements for bone densitometry testing will be provided through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), cost-sharing arrangements with the States and Territories are not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government is not intending to establish a population-based screening program using bone densitometry testing. Osteoporosis experts in Australia and overseas agree that bone densitometry, a test for measuring bone density, is not an effective screening tool for developing osteoporosis. Experts, however, agree that bone densitometry is a valuable test in the diagnosis and management of established osteoporosis and other bone density related conditions. It is on this basis that the Government will improve access to bone densitometry testing in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The specification of a Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item(s) for bone densitometry has been referred to the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee (MBAC) for advice.

Nationally coordinated policy developments such as the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, the National Forest Policy Statement and the National Greenhouse Response Strategy have removed much of the need for a Commonwealth-based inquiry agency. The Commonwealth also has a wide range of investigatory and general inquiry bodies including under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 through the Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority (CEPA), the Australian Science and Technology Council (ASTEC) and the Industry Commission (IC).</PARA>

Other inquiry agencies such as CEPA, the IC and ASTEC also have the capacity to undertake environmental resource inquiries when the need arises.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No, it was not put to tender. The Air New Zealand contract for Dart engine overhaul for the Australian Defence Force fell due for renewal in 1993. A new Standing Offer was negotiated with Air New Zealand in July 1993 without putting out Requests for Tenders on the basis of satisfactory performance, value for money and the fact that Air New Zealand is now the only company in the Australia/New Zealand area offering Dart engine maintenance facilities.</PARA>
