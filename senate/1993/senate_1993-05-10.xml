<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer to last Friday's unprecedented decision to relieve a senior public servant, Ms Christine Goode, of her duties in the department when there is nothing on the public record to indicate any wrongdoing and before the departmental inquiry has even started. Why is this decision to take action against Ms Goode before she has had a right of reply not the classic case of a denial of natural justice? What role did the Minister play in the events leading up to her transfer?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The real question in this chamber is, in fact: what role did Senator Alston play? I did see that article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and it is grossly inaccurate. I have estimated that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> carried more than 1,500 words on the pay television issue. There are three separate references to a senior departmental officer, Christine Goode, `being forced to stand aside'; two of them are on the front page. In the 1,500 or so words that were devoted to this topic in the paper the following morning, 23 words were missing. Those were the words in the first sentence of the two-paragraph agreement issued by Mr Evans, the secretary to the department, and Ms Goode containing the key words `by mutual agreement'. I intend to have far more to say about this particular issue later on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story and others like it appear to have emanated from a meeting that I had in the lobby outside this chamber with Senator Alston and, thank God, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot. I was contacted early that morning by the secretary to my department, who told me that he was to meet Ms Goode later that morning.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot is right. Thank God there was someone else there. I said, `I spoke to Mr Evans and he spoke to me about the meeting he was going to have'. He was concerned about misapprehensions that may arise from anything that arose at that meeting about punitive action or pre-empting inquiries. I said that I would take care of that in the normal manner&mdash;the normal manner, I add, that I have used in 16 years in this business and with which I never had the slightest difficulty with Warwick Smith, the former shadow Minister. It will be the last meeting I ever have with Senator Alston.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that meeting I told Senator Alston and Senator Kernot that the meeting was to be held, that I had told Mr Evans that that was a matter that had nothing to do with me and that normal Public Service procedures would apply, whatever happened at that meeting. I specifically told Senator Alston and Senator Kernot that if something resulted from this meeting it could in no way be seen to be pre-empting it but it was a situation that obviously Ms Goode and Mr Evans had to discuss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot, to the best of my knowledge, respected that confidence. I will tell the Senate what Senator Alston did. Senator Alston went out and got on the telephone. He rang a whole swag of journalists in the press gallery, three of whom rang my office to check the story. Bits of what he told them were printed on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Senator Alston told these journalists that I had told him that `heads were rolling in the department' and that there was a political witch-hunt. Without getting into the details of that meeting&mdash;Senator Kernot knows perfectly well the sensitivity of the issues that were discussed&mdash;nothing I said at that meeting could possibly have been construed in that way at all. I say in hindsight again, thank God there was at least one honest person present at that meeting. The journalists in the press gallery that Senator Alston contacted will know what he said to them and I know what he said to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a disgraceful piece of behaviour from Senator Alston, the like of which I have not experienced in 16 years in politics and I have had plenty of meetings. Ms Goode has provided me with a statement as to the real reason&mdash;</PARA>

I asked Mr Evans&mdash;and I would never have done so otherwise&mdash;to provide me with the real explanation as to what happened at that meeting and it has been provided to me.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GG4">Senator FOREMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Science and Small Business. Is the Minister aware that the South Australian Legislative Council has rejected the legislation that would have enabled South Australia to be a participating jurisdiction in the mutual recognition agreement for the promotion of the free flow of goods and service providers in a national market throughout Australia? What are the ramifications of this rejection and how will it affect South Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="334" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Foreman quite rightly points out to the Senate that, in an extraordinary performance, the Liberal Party of Australia and the Australian Democrats two weeks ago in the Legislative Council of South Australia rejected a Bill to establish mutual recognition. That is the only House of any parliament of Australia that I am aware of that has rejected this. All Labor and Liberal governments have agreed to this proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out to the Liberal Party members opposite that this proposal was initiated by Nick Greiner when he was the Liberal Premier of New South Wales. It is extraordinary that a bunch of antediluvian 18th century constitutional bigots, in the Legislative Council of South Australia would reject a proposal that would have established something in Australia that Europe, with all its differences, established with one single market from 1 January of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I think it is typical of the Opposition in South Australia that it was unable to see the bigger picture. The reason it is disappointing is that, because it has refused to allow the Bill through, South Australia will not be able to participate in this national scheme. South Australian manufacturers will suffer because they will not have access to the larger Australian market with the same standards; South Australian consumers will suffer because they will have inconsistent standards in South Australia. It means that South Australia will be out of step with the rest of Australia over this very important micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to see the Premier of South Australia, Lynn Arnold, vehemently criticise the Legislative Council, the Liberal Party and the Democrats for opposing this legislation. The criticisms raised by the Liberal Party and the Democrats in the South Australian Legislative Council about lowering South Australian standards could have all been dealt with through the appropriate ministerial council. No other government, Labor or Liberal, in Australia has rejected&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. I refer to standing order 193(3), which states that a senator shall not reflect on members of Houses in the States. Senator Schacht used a variety of words, all of which I am sure were offensive to our colleagues in the State Parliament, including the word `bigots'. I would ask you, Mr President, to instruct Senator Schacht to withdraw those offensive words.</PARA></TALK.START>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="The PRESIDENT" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Senator Schacht at the start of his answer I think did use terms that perhaps should have been withdrawn. I think the latter part of his contribution was only criticism, but I think the first words that he used were probably wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I will withdraw the words I used at the start of my remarks that you ask me to. In continuing to answer the question from Senator Foreman, I would point out that I have had as a South Australian citizen the experience of seeing the Legislative Council, as the repository of conservatism in South Australia, doing everything it can to affect progressive legislation from Labor governments over the last 2 1/2 decades; so I am sure honourable senators will understand my feelings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was saying before the point of order was raised by Senator Kemp, the concerns that the Democrats and the Liberal Party may have had about this legislation could have easily been dealt with in the appropriate forum, the ministerial council. None of them was referred to the ministerial council; they just knocked the legislation off in a mad fit of pique about States rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we have heard the Leader of the Democrats in the Senate, Senator Kernot, talk about abolishing the States. I wish she would speak to the Leader of the Democrats in the Legislative Council in South Australia and convince that part of the party to take a national outlook on this issue. I would also ask Senator Hill, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and also a South Australian Liberal senator, to use his influence with those conservative Liberal members of the South Australian Legislative Council to convince them to let this legislation through so that Australia, in common with Europe, can have one national market as far as national standards are concerned. The micro-economic reform of this country makes it absolutely essential that that should occur.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I categorically deny having informed any journalist whatsoever that heads would be rolling; I will elaborate later. My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Why is it that Ms Goode sought to be transferred; why did the department agree to any such transfer; and, given that the Minister presumably is acutely aware that by being publicly identified as having been transferred, whether or not `by mutual consent', it would not do her career prospects any good at all, why did the Minister not endeavour to talk her out of it, or at least stand up for her position?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the announcement that was made by the US Defense Secretary, which was a response to the attention that had been focused in recent weeks on the treatment of women in the US military forces following the investigation into the Tailhook incident. Tailhook, as many honourable senators would be aware, refers to the harassment of women at a conference of naval aviators. This demonstrated that serious attitudinal problems still exist as far as treatment of women in the US military by their colleagues is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Defence Force policy on the issue of employment of women in the services is not driven by decisions made in the US, but rather by the attitudes and the expectations of the Australian community. The Senate should understand that the approach taken in the US does not go quite as far as that which has already been undertaken by the ADF in this country. For some time now women have been able to serve in combat related roles in the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 December last year, my predecessor Mr Bilney announced that the range of roles open to women in the ADF was to be widened. It now includes all positions that do not involve actual face-to-face combat. This new policy has effectively opened up to service women 99 per cent of the Navy, 99 per cent of the RAAF and 83 per cent of the Army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women can serve in the following areas: all Navy ships, excluding the current Oberon class submarines, but once the new Collins class submarine enters service in 1996 women will be able to serve on those vessels; all types of Army units except for armour, artillery, combat engineers and infantry; and all categories of employment in the Air Force, except for ground defence officers. These changes have opened up to women 87 per cent of all uniform positions in the ADF. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is a further indication and example of how ADF policy is continually being updated in this area, in line with the longstanding aim of the Government to modernise employment policies and practices in the ADF to reflect current community standards and current community expectations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I ask: does the Commonwealth Government have any powers or international obligations to intervene to stop exploration or mining of resources in areas adjacent to or within the Ningaloo Marine Park in Western Australia?  Specifically, what powers exist under the Endangered Species Act 1992, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 or the Australian Constitution?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the detailed question asked by Senator Chamarette is as follows: the Ningaloo Marine Park encompasses both Commonwealth and State waters declared separately under Commonwealth and State legislation. There are also adjacent Commonwealth waters and adjacent waters administered by the State which are not part of the Ningaloo Marine Park. At a recent oil industry meeting, the Western Australian Premier, Mr Court, is reported to have indicated his Government's intention to permit oil exploration in Ningaloo Marine Park. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly, has written to Mr Kevin Minson, the Western Australian Minister for the Environment, for clarification and seeking his assurance that full environmental assessments will be carried out for any activities proposed to be conducted in or near the Ningaloo Marine Park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the Senate on behalf of the Government that no exploration or mining leases have been awarded in Commonwealth waters either in or around the boundaries of Ningaloo Marine Park since its declaration. With regard to waters administered by the State, the applicability of the Commonwealth legislation specified in the question is as follows: with regard to the Endangered Species Act 1992, if no Commonwealth action or decisions are involved, the Endangered Species Act 1992 could not be invoked. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 is not applicable. With regard to the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, while Ningaloo Marine Park is entered on the interim list of the Register of the National Estate, the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 could not be triggered unless there was a Commonwealth involvement in the decision to explore or drill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, so long as there is no requirement for a  decision by a Commonwealth Minister or authority, the provisions of this legislation could not be invoked. The World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1981 is not applicable. There are no direct powers in the Australian Constitution allowing the Commonwealth to legislate to protect the environment. There are, however, a number of heads of power that, depending on the circumstances, might be available to enable the Government to intervene. These include section 51(i), international or interstate trade or commerce; section 51(xx), corporations; or section 51(xxix), external affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's constitutional powers to legislate for all matters affecting the sea and seabed below low water on the coast of States or Territories may also be relevant. This power was established by the High Court in the seas and submerged lands case of 1975. The Commonwealth transferred the seabed title and sea jurisdiction out to three nautical miles to the States and the Northern Territory in the offshore constitutional settlement of 1980. This was done by Commonwealth legislation of the Fraser Government.</PARA>

She has not changed at all; she still misses. During the election my predecessor, Mr Howe, proposed to bring forward the date of a national vaccination program on HIB from 1 July to 1 April. The promise has not been kept. It has not been kept for two reasons: firstly, not all the States could gear up to do it by then; and, secondly, the savings involved in sticking to the tender process announced last year are so great that it would have been rather foolish to deny taxpayers that benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you would realise what an expert I have been on the TAFE system over the last couple of weeks! I have only a certain amount of information. If it does not cover the area that Senator Sowada has asked about, I will endeavour, over time, to get a fuller response. This Government, as part of its objective to reform Australia's training system, is encouraging the States and Territories to adopt a more flexible, yet nationally consistent, approach to a wider range of training matters. As part of this process, since 1987 the Government has ensured that any impediments in the TAFE system to enabling greater access and participation have been removed. This has resulted in State and Territory governments imposing fees which are not consistent because of the different environmental factors which have faced each system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has chaired an officials working party on the matter of TAFE fees, exemptions and concessions which has recently reported to the State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers. Ministers have agreed to common definitions of fees and charges and asked the working party that further work be undertaken to develop a more nationally consistent framework to fees, charges, exemptions and concessions. It is not the Government's intention that this should be seen as a revenue-raising exercise by the States or Territories, or as an opportunity by the Commonwealth to introduce a HECS-style scheme for TAFE. In fact, during the election the Government committed itself not to introduce a system of fees or vouchers. Opposition proposals to do so were soundly trounced in the recent election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A significant outcome for the Commonwealth from this process is to ensure that the national student charge framework must take account of access and equity issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before, I had two memos in front of me in respect of this meeting with Mr Cosser, both of them provided to the Federal Court on the public record, both of them referred to, one after the other, in my own submission to the court; Senator Alston, of course, omitted reference to the second one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston's assertion was that the effect of these memos was to demonstrate that I had been advised by the department that MDS was a real goer for supplanting the satellite as the major delivery system for pay television. I have tabled this, so I do not have to read all of it, but I would like honourable senators who heard that explanation to listen to how strongly this memo supports the capacity of MDS to deliver a service, supplanting the satellite. The memo states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">MDS technology is constrained in its capacity to deliver local and more widespread services by a number of limitations</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-it requires direct line-of-sight to a transmitter or a "beam-bender" to be receivable</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Alston needs&mdash;a beam bender. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">:reception is therefore difficult in hilly terrain such as Sydney</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">:reception would be blocked by buildings or even trees growing</PARA>
<PARA>Very supportive, this advice! It continues:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an operator wanted to establish a network in Australia, he or she would need to</PARA>

<PARA>It is a joke. Senator Alston has tried to capitalise on the feeding frenzy that has developed in the media on the question of pay television. He has certainly attempted to mislead some journalists on this. He has certainly misled the Senate in his questions today on this matter.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the court case involving Mr Wickham last week, I have been publicly asked a number of questions about my and my department's involvement in the Gillespie matter including, in particular, our reaction to possible Indonesian involvement, contacts with Malaysia on the access issue, and my department's contacts with the Gillespie family. I am happy to take this opportunity to respond to those questions. May I say at the outset, though, that I have also been asked a number of questions about the extradition proceedings which are now under way. But these are all properly addressed to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), whose ministerial responsibility it is for this aspect of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, on the subject of possible Indonesian involvement and our reaction to that, there are three different questions that have been asked which I will treat together. They are: was the Minister and his department previously aware of the allegation made in the Melbourne County Court that the military administrator of Irian Jaya had given assistance to the Prince; if so, when did he or his department become aware, and what action was taken and will now be taken to test these allegations; did the Minister make Mrs Gillespie aware of the allegations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My department first became aware of the possible presence in Indonesia of the Prince and the Gillespie children, and the possibility of assistance being rendered to them by Indonesian military officials, on the afternoon of 24 July 1992, but it was not until late on 25 July that my department first became aware of the name Colonel Sujap Miko. The description of Colonel Sujap Miko as military administrator or military governor of Irian Jaya is not correct. The Irian Jaya military command was occupied at the time by an officer at major-general level. We have no knowledge at this stage of a Colonel Sujap Miko holding any position in Irian Jaya at the relevant time, but under the Indonesian military system, officers of full colonel rank may hold command at the `resort' level, of which there are three such commands in Irian Jaya, and half colonels may hold command at the local district level, of which there are nine such commands in Irian Jaya, including one for Merauke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information received by the department on 24 July was conveyed to me later that day in Manila, where I was attending the ASEAN PMC conference. I told Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas that evening that we had received a tip-off that day that the children might be in Indonesia and asked him to make any inquiries he could to confirm this, which he agreed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the same day, 24 July, on instructions from acting Foreign Minister John Kerin, the charge of our mission in Jakarta told the Indonesian foreign ministry in Jakarta that we had information that the children could be in Indonesia, possibly in Irian Jaya, and ministry officials undertook to get back to us. The matter was also raised by Vice Admiral Beaumont in Jakarta that evening directly with the Indonesian Armed Forces Chief of Staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later on the evening of 24 July, my department told the Gillespie's lawyers that we had reason to believe that the children were in Indonesia, that I had already raised the matter with Foreign Minister Alatas, and that I would be discussing it with Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi. On 25 July, further follow-up action was undertaken by the Australian Embassy in Jakarta with Defence and Interpol, seeking an urgent response to our inquiries. On that day, I also described to a press conference in Manila the action that I had taken with Mr Alatas. On 26 July, I was told by Indonesian Foreign Minister Alatas that he had as yet not been able to get any information about the possible presence of the children in Indonesia. I again told that to the Australian media that afternoon. None of the other inquiries instituted had borne any fruit by then, nor have they subsequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the afternoon of that day, 26 July, at 3 o'clock KL time, the Prince held a press conference in Kuala Lumpur claiming that he had arrived in that city the preceding day, 25 July, and had returned to Malaysia `several days ago'. It was not until 30 July, following my return to Australia and the appearance of further press articles speculating about details of the Prince's flight from Australia, that my office was advised of the information my department had received on 25 July specifically naming a Colonel Miko. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not seek any explanation from the Indonesians last year on the question of possible involvement by officials, and in particular a Colonel Miko, in the transit of the Prince and the children through Indonesia. That was essentially for two reasons. First, as I have just said, it was clear by mid-afternoon on 26 July that the Prince and the children were back in Malaysia, and becoming preoccupied with how they had got there was not going to be helpful in getting them back. Our efforts since then have been wholly focused on questions of access and return. Secondly, we have never had any information from any source suggesting possible involvement at the Indonesian Government level, that is to say, of a nature or of a kind that would raise serious diplomatic or intergovernmental questions. I note in this respect that Mr James McDonald, counsel for Mr Wickham, said outside the court on 6 May in an interview with Paul Barber on 3AW:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the actions of Colonel Miko should be distinguished from the Indonesian Government. There's no suggestion that this involvement of Colonel Miko or the authorities in Merauke were endorsed by the Indonesian Government.</PARA>
<PARA>In an interview on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program on 7 May 1993, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no evidence to suggest that this was done with Indonesian formal government approval or endorsement or anything of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA>However, on the question of follow-up now, we do have more detailed information on the record, as a result of the court action against Mr Wickham, suggesting the involvement of Colonel Miko and some other unnamed officials. In all the circumstances, I think it is appropriate that we now take this matter up with the Indonesian Government, seeking detailed information about, and some explanation of, the matters that were thus raised in court. Today I have sent a detailed cable to our embassy in Jakarta instructing it to this effect. Obviously, I cannot speculate at this stage as to what the results of these inquiries will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further question has been asked about our contacts with the Malaysian Government on questions of access; namely, what attempts has the Minister or his department made to obtain access for Mrs Gillespie to her children? I should say at the outset that there are two types of access which have been discussed in the context of this case: first, the question of parental access; secondly, consular access. As to parental access, I should make it clear that the Government has no role in the matter of access for Mrs Gillespie to her children. Parental custody and access are necessarily matters for the parents and in particular the courts of the two countries. Nevertheless, notwithstanding that limitation on our capacity to have any actual role, both I and my department have repeatedly registered with the Malaysian Government Mrs Gillespie's interest in securing access to her children. We have asked in particular that no governmental impediment be placed in the way of access by her. I have written to Foreign Minister Abdullah with this request, as well as raising it with him personally, and I have also raised it with the Malaysian High Commissioner in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to consular access, that is a government role, but the Government's role is limited to what we can do in the particular context; that is, in seeking access by consular officials to determine the children's welfare. We have no right of consular access because the children are not in the custody or control of the Malaysian Government. The decision rests with the children's natural father, Raja Kamarul Bahrin Shah, with whom the children currently reside, and therein has been the problem. I made all this very clear in the Senate estimates hearings last September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our efforts to inquire about the children's whereabouts first of all and then, when that became clear, to actually obtain consular access as well as to make representations on the subject of parental access, have involved a total of over 30 separate contacts at ministerial, High Commissioner, or other official levels. Those contacts are summarised in a schedule to this statement which I now seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the subject of contact with the Gillespie family and the question about why I have not met with Mrs Gillespie since her children were taken to Malaysia in July last year, let me make it clear at the outset that there has been an enormous amount of communication between my department and Mrs Gillespie's lawyers since last July. My department has initiated in the order of 100 phone calls to Mrs Gillespie's lawyers since last July and it is estimated that those lawyers have initiated a similar number&mdash;namely, about 100&mdash;back to my department. This is in addition to contacts that have been made between Mrs Gillespie's lawyers and the Attorney-General's Department in the specific context of extradition and other technical legal questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Gillespie first sought a personal interview with me in her letter of 16 September 1992. She said then that she had had no personal contact with officials since her children had first been taken and that she had certain points relating to the children's welfare that she wanted to raise with me. I responded to that request in a detailed letter of 17 September and, in the light of many suggestions that have been made that I have never properly explained the Government's position to Mrs Gillespie, I seek leave to table and incorporate the text of that particular letter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">157 Victoria Road</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HAWTHORN  VIC  3123</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mrs Gillespie</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter to me of 16 September about the abduction of your children to Malaysia. I do sympathise with you enormously in your distress over this whole unhappy affair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In your letter you request a personal interview with me to discuss possible government action, noting that you have had no direct personal contact with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade since 26 July 1992. You will be aware, I assume, that your lawyers have had frequent and substantive discussions with the Department since that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the state of my program, including departure overseas again next week, I am afraid that it will be very difficult for me to find an opportunity to meet you. But I can make in this letter all the points I would face to face about the possibility of consular access to the children, of access by yourself to the children and of extradition of the father to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consular access in cases such as yours is not, as a matter of international law and practice, something that is granted as of right. It is a matter of discretion for the government in question, and at the end of the day that discretion is subject to the willingness of the parent in possession of the children to grant access. Regrettably, we seem to have pretty well exhausted that process. It seems that while there has been no roadblock placed by the Malaysian Government, the father, Raja Bahrin, has not so far been prepared to agree to access to the children for Consular officers from our High Commission. You will be aware that I made personal representations to the Malaysian Foreign Minister, requesting him to use his good offices in gaining consular access, and that I have also personally raised the matter with the Malaysian High Commissioner here and&mdash;yesterday&mdash;with a visiting Malaysian Parliamentary delegation. The Malaysian Foreign Minister has written to me advising that our request has been conveyed to Raja Bahrin. The Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur has also been active in trying to obtain consular access, through representations to the relevant Malaysian authorities and directly to Raja Bahrin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for parental access by yourself to the children, we have, as you know, also made representations asking that the Malaysian Government place no impediment in the way of such access, and I have heard nothing in reply to suggest that any governmental impediment will be placed in your way. Again, we have no right under international law to demand parental access. Essentially such access is a matter of private law for the courts in the country in question to determine, and I understand that you are considering pursuing that particular legal course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So far as the question of extradition of your former husband is concerned, I have been advised by the Attorney-General, on checking with him yesterday, that while he and his Department have given consideration to the difficult legal questions that would need to be addressed in any such proceeding, there is no formal extradition application presently before him, and unless and until such an application is pursued by the police authorities, the issue will remain hypothetical. May I also repeat in this context the point that I and other Ministers have repeatedly made: unhappily, no such proceeding would do anything to bring your children back to Australia, nor would it appear to assist in any way the prospects of your securing access to your children in Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the position is simply that there are a number of legal and other constraints on what governments can do in these sad circumstances, which unfortunately arise all too frequently (there have been over 80 recorded abductions from Australia in the past two years). I believe that the Government has acted in your case to the fullest extent open to it within these constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The abduction of your children has certainly drawn attention to the inadequacy of existing arrangements between Australia and most of our regional neighbours to ensure that orders of the Family Court of Australia are recognised in those countries (and vice versa). Wider adherence to the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction would reduce the problem. I have agreed with the Minister for Justice, Senator Tate (who has portfolio responsibility for the Convention) to take action to encourage relevant countries to become parties to the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can only say again that I am deeply sorry that the situation developed as it did, and that we are as a Government simply unable to do more. I hope very much that you do succeed in your effort to gain access to your children, and that you find them well and happy when you do.</PARA>

<PARA>There are many unsatisfactory matters in relation to the so-called Gillespie affair; some of them we have dealt with on previous occasions. The first was the ease with which these two young children, Australian citizens, could be removed from the jurisdiction of the Australian courts and taken offshore. You will remember, Mr President, our complaints about that and our unhappiness as to the confusion that apparently existed within and between Australian law enforcement bodies which led to the Glenn inquiry and report. That report told us that the police in the north of Australia had not been warned to keep watch on the possibility of the children being taken offshore through a northern port. The report also said that Coastwatch had not been informed to keep watch in case the children were being taken offshore by boat so that then possibly, with a bit of luck, they may have been able to intervene in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found out in due course that the children were taken by boat from a northern Australian port and that an Australian naval vessel came ever so close to coming upon the children, in that it seems that it did come upon the boat in which the children were present but, because of this terrible lack of communication, consideration was not given to whether or not the children were on board that boat. It was a highly unsatisfactory sequence of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me now is that, as a result of that experience and as a result of the Glenn report, I do not see that this Government has put in place a structure that will give the Australian people any greater confidence that, in the same circumstance occurring again, there would be any increased likelihood of the children being apprehended and protected by Australian authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What grieves me most about this process, apart from the fact that these two children were abducted and taken from our shores, is the fact that there is no improved structure in place that can give the Australian people greater confidence of a more satisfactory result in repeat circumstances. Unfortunately, these circumstances do occur. They all vary slightly but they do occur&mdash;much more often than we would like. That was an unsatisfactory aspect and remains an unsatisfactory aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that caused us concern, and still causes us concern, is the way in which the Minister, Senator Evans, has treated Mrs Gillespie in this case. I would not have thought that it was unreasonable, after all these months, for Mrs Gillespie to expect a personal face-to-face consultation with the Minister to discuss questions of what effort the Australian Government is making to at least provide her with access to her children in Malaysia. The Minister has made the decision that it is not appropriate for him to do so and I think that is highly disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that Foreign Ministers are busy, and this might be seen in some sense as a matter personal to the Gillespies, although I think it is greater than that because of the abuse of the Australian protective system. Nevertheless, even a Minister must be sensitive to mothers who lose their children in this way. I would have thought that it was not unreasonable for Mrs Gillespie to expect Senator Evans to be prepared to speak to her about the matter. Some personal reassurance by Senator Evans that he was treating this matter seriously might have gone a long way to relieving Mrs Gillespie's very well-based concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We spoke to Senator Evans in estimates back in September. One got the impression that this was really not an appropriate matter for a Foreign Minister. He had spoken to his counterpart, the Foreign Minister of Malaysia, and, having discussed it, they said that they had put in train certain processes. That was really about all that an Australian citizen should expect from the Australian Foreign Minister, according to Senator Evans. If Senator Evans disputes what I say, I invite anyone to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 15 September 1992, and I do not think they will reach any other interpretation. There was a lack of sensitivity involved, and, I suspect, a lack of real effort and interest on behalf of Senator Evans to press the Malaysian Foreign Minister and other authorities to provide access&mdash;which is all that is being asked for in this particular instance&mdash;to the mother of these children. That is something that disappoints me and certainly very reasonably disappoints Mrs Gillespie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it concerns me that, although the issue of extradition was before the Attorney-General's Department in September of last year, when the Minister acknowledged that it was under consideration, nothing was done for all of these months. Extradition proceedings were taken out against the accomplice but it was not until some eight months later, after an election and with a new Attorney-General, that any further action was really taken on the extradition issue. I think that is unsatisfactory. There is no explanation as to why it has taken so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the longer these matters take before proceedings are instituted, the more difficult they are to prosecute. Furthermore, unfortunately it gives the signal to the other side that perhaps the Australian Government is not really serious.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fourth matter that I regard as unsatisfactory is that it is not until now that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has apparently raised the issue with the Indonesian authorities as to whether and how the children were able to obtain passage through Indonesia. I accept what the Minister has said about Mr Alatas seeking to pursue the matter and not being able to find any relevant information at the time, but within a few days of that statement, the children were found in Malaysia and I think it was accepted by everyone that their passage to Malaysia had been through Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it was obvious that the Australian Government would have made inquiries as to how this could have occurred&mdash;how one can get through the, in some ways, quite rigorous customs procedures of Indonesia and how the children might have obtained passage&mdash;at the very least to reduce the risk of such an occurrence again occurring. I find it astonishing that it is not until now, another eight months since we pressed this in estimates, that the Australian Government has been prepared to at least ask questions as to how this might have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that, for example, when the accomplice was arrested over a month ago and no doubt told the police exactly the same story that he told in court in Melbourne last week, the Australian Government at the very least would then have started making inquiries of the Indonesian Government as to how this might have occurred. It seems to me to be totally unsatisfactorily explained to the Senate why it is not until now that the Australian Government would make any inquiry of Indonesian authorities as to how this passage might have been obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it seems to me that this is a matter that should not be let lie. These Australian citizens are still beyond the protection of the Australian courts. The Australian Government has not acted in a satisfactory way in relation to this matter. The efforts made to apprehend the children before they were taken out of the country were unsatisfactory, and the breakdowns in communication were intolerable. The efforts of Senator Evans and his department to obtain consular access have been insufficient and his disinterest in the matter has been unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's lack of interest in pursuing the Indonesian question&mdash;how the children might have obtained passage through the country is unsatisfactory. The incredibly slow process in commencing extradition proceedings against this man&mdash;proceedings under the Family Law Act have already been instituted&mdash;has not been satisfactorily explained by this Government. The matter should not be allowed to lie at this stage, but requires further pursuit. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At 5 p.m. on Thursday 9 July 1992, the Prince picked up the children for an access period visit scheduled for two nights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday 11 July, Mrs Gillespie informed the Federal Police that it appeared the children and their natural father had not been in their Melbourne hotel, the Victoria hotel in Little Collins Street, for two days. The police said they would mount an unofficial alert for the children at all Australian ports. This was upgraded to an official alert for the children after they had not been returned scheduled for 12.30 on Sunday 12 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A family court warrant was issued at 10.30 p.m. on Sunday 12 July for the return of the children and a publication order was also issued permitting Jacqueline to speak to the media in the hope that publicity would aid the search. The warrant specifi-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cally charged officers of all Australian police forces to search for the children, to stop-search ships and planes and to take custody of the children by force, if necessary. A warrant was also issued for the arrest of the Prince on charges under the Family Law Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all done by Australian courts, under Australian laws, to assist Australian citizens. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At 11.15 p.m. on Friday 24 July 1992, Mr David Rutter, of the foreign affairs department, telephoned the Gillespie's lawyers to say the children were in Indonesia travelling towards Malaysia. Despite repeated requests from the lawyers and Mrs Gillespie, Mr Rutter refused to give further details and would not say who had sighted them, where or what condition the children were in. Attempts the following day by the Gillespie's legal firm, Price Bent, to retain Indonesian lawyers to seek the children's return were thwarted by the refusal of Foreign Affairs to provide additional information.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the lawyers in Indonesia said that they could get an order of the court to prevent the children leaving Indonesia if they could find out where on earth the children were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other things in this statement that are left unanswered rather than answered by the statement of Senator Evans. Mr Wickham's lawyer said in his summation to the court last week that Mr Wickham was unable to leave Merauke because his boat was unable to leave. He said he was threatened that if he went back to Australia he or his family would be at risk. His boat was sold by the Indonesians for the equivalent of $7,000 and the money from the sale of the boat was used to purchase airline tickets. Mr Wickham was flown under escort of Indonesian officials to Amsterdam where he was able to escape that escort. He caught a shuttle plane to the United Kingdom and then went to the United States where he was finally extradited to Australia for his part in the kidnapping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the point the Minister makes and the counsel for Mr Wickham makes that there is no evidence of any collaboration between Colonel Miko and the Indonesian Government but, nonetheless, as Colonel Miko has been identified, the plot gets worse, if one likes, in the sense that, at about the same time that Mr Wickham was placed under house arrest by the said Colonel Miko, 10 other Australian officials presumably from the Minister's own department&mdash;and I ask him to tell us whether or not this is so&mdash;and that of Immigration were in the same area, as I understand it, to repatriate Indonesian fishermen. It just so happened that the timing was coincidental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These same 10 Australian officials, I am told, were placed under similar house arrest. They were not allowed to go near the airport. There was talk about guns being pointed at people. What inquiry has the Minister made about that? In other words, it seems that there was an opportunity at that moment when Mr Rutter called the Gillespies and said, `Your children are in Indonesia', to move speedily and find Indonesian lawyers who were prepared to take action under Indonesian law and prevent those children from being spirited out of Indonesia to another jurisdiction, that is, Malaysia. The bungling that has gone on did not stop there. This statement goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Tuesday, 28 July, an Australian helicopter pilot, Colonel Ferguson, arrived back in Australia and told the media he had seen the children aboard a flight from the Indonesian territory of Irian Jaya to Sulawesi in Indonesia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. The statement continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some days later Coastwatch announced that it had heard distress signals from an Indonesian fishing boat which had drifted out of control for four days in the Torres Strait. Coastwatch had been aware of the boat while it was still in Australian waters and a full search and rescue operation had been coordinated in Canberra. Coastwatch aircraft had circled the boat after hearing distress calls mentioning two children were aboard but they were unaware of the alert mounted by the Federal police.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Federal police and the Coastwatch had not bothered to talk to each other. What sort of security are we spending money on that says we cannot have it? The Federal police was reported in the media as admitting it had not informed the Coastwatch or other similar authorities. Where is that investigation? Where is remedy taken to ensure that it will not happen again? How many other times have things such as this occurred where maybe drugs have slipped through the net? The statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Navy boat, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dubbo</EMPHASIS>, was called back after the captain claimed the vessel had entered international waters and was refusing help from Australian authorities. The fishing boat was heard to radio in English for a specific Indonesian Army Colonel, the Indonesian military forces Commander-in-Chief at Irian Jaya, to rescue them. On July 20 the Indonesian military escorted the Prince and his abducted children into Merauke in Irian Jaya. On the same day, 20 July&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is what I referred to; the same day that the children are with the Indonesian escort&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">two plane loads of Australian officials were inexplicably detained at Merauke, forbidden access to their aircraft and followed everywhere they went by armed guards.</PARA>
<PARA>The questions that I would like to ask the Minister, just on those questions alone, are the following. Where was the intensive inquiry into why the Federal police did not inform the coastguard? Where was the inquiry as to why 10 Australian officials were followed and placed under effective house arrest? Presumably the Minister has taken no action about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be very pleased to listen to it. What transpired that was so special in that evidence that went on the public record last week that finally caused this Government to act? In other words, Senator Hill referred to the fact that the DPP was involved in preparing those extradition papers back in September. It is my information that those extradition papers were ready to go in October. Why were they not proceeded with? Why did the Minister refuse at every request to speak to Mrs Gillespie? The answer she says she gets from the Minister is: `You're just one of 80. Why should I talk to you?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attitude is that these are Australian citizens in a difficult position against a foreign country. The Minister will not even bend his head to an Australian citizen, but apparently is prepared at all times to be more concerned about a foreign interest. The Gillespies took particular exception to the Minister going on public radio and saying, `Of course, the Prince could have brought extradition proceedings because she'd pinched the kids'. Well, they did not. The Prince put Mrs Gillespie and her children on the plane with a full royal escort because she had an ill grandmother. This was just after the Prince has taken a second wife, after swearing on the crown not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Gillespie came back to Australia to see her grandmother with the grandchildren. It was while she was here that she sought legal advice and remained here. The statement that the Minister made on public radio&mdash;that she could be charged with pinching the kids from Malaysia&mdash;was found not to be so by a full bench of the Family Court. That is Australian law again, and when it comes to a competition in this country between Australian law and foreign law, the Minister is supposed to uphold Australian law and not tug the forelock at some foreign nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to the question of consular visits. Is the Minister going to deny today that last November DFAT, his department, told Mrs Gillespie's lawyers that if the Gillespies made no public statements his department would try to achieve consular access?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For God's sake is right. These are Australian children and Mrs Gillespie is an Australian citizen. The Minister has not even deigned to give her the courtesy of speaking with her personally. At every opportunity he seemed to simply fob her off with a letter and the attitude that if one does not think about it, the whole problem might just go away. Well, it will not go away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we finally have on the record, firstly, that there was an opportunity to get those children out of Indonesia and that that opportunity was not taken; secondly, that there has been an opportunity to use the extradition proceedings since last October and it took an election and a Minister who presumably sees, after these questions have been raised by me and others, that lack of action is simply no longer acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Item 39 of the Glenn report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late on 24 July the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told Mr and Mrs Gillespie they were reasonably certain the children were in Indonesia on their way to Malaysia.</PARA>
<PARA>In the Minister's statement today he has said that Colonel Miko did not meet the technical description used in the court proceedings. The Minister said it was possible that someone of Colonel Miko's rank could have held a number of other positions. What efforts has the Minister made to ascertain what position he did in fact hold, or is the Minister trying to say that Colonel Miko did not exist? What resources did he have? With regard to the questions that the Minister is now asking the Indonesian Government, why did he not do it at the time he first had the information? Why did he not pass that information on to Mrs Gillespie? The reason that he has decided only now to go ahead with the matter is quite apparent&mdash;namely, because it has been placed on the public record. It is not good enough. Rule No. 1: Foreign Ministers of Australia look after Australian citizens first; rule No. 2: when Australian children are abducted into foreign lands, the Minister has a responsibility to do more than have a bit of a chat with a Minister whom he happens to know from a foreign country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December last year the Opposition announced it would review those sections of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No 3) 1992 relating to unrealised capital gains on listed securities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has adhered to that commitment to undertake a review following the Federal Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of that review a Private Members Bill was introduced last week namely the Social Security Amendment Bill 1993. It was made clear at that time that a companion Bill would be introduced to make similar amendments in regard to the veterans affairs portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are to ensure that certain proposed changes made by Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1992 concerning the treatment of shares and other listed investments do not come into operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Listed Securities) Bill 1993 makes virtually mirror amendments to those proposed in the Social Security Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly is amends Section 5J of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 dealing with definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly is omits the words "and listed securities" from the heading to Subdivision AA of Division 8 of Part 111 of the Principal Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly it amends Section 46 by omitting some words and figures from the table "STRUCTURE OF DIVISION" and omits subsection (2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the value of share dividends is regarded as income for pension purposes. However capital growth is ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the governments proposal was to extend the current rules applying to managed investment to capital gains and losses during the previous 12 months on shares and other securities listed on the stock exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's main argument when introducing this measure was that it would mean that listed shares and securities would be treated in the same way under the veterans' affairs income test as managed investments. Central to the government's argument was the fact that in 1988 the parliament had moved to prevent pensioners from circumventing the income test by treating unrealised gains from managed investments as income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From its consultations with affected groups and individuals, it has become obvious to the Coalition that this measure will neither result in the estimated savings claimed by the government, nor introduce any greater degree of equity or fairness into the income and assets test for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Budget Paper No. 3 1992-93 lists the net savings resulting from the ongoing assessment of capital gains and losses of listed shares and other securities of $20.3m in 1993-94, $24.1m in 1994-95 and $24.9m in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However none of the financial estimates for this proposal include an assessment of the inevitable impact it would have on investment behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation quoted the chief economist of the Australian Stock Exchange as stating that a "significant number of pensioners" would sell, adding that he doubted the government's ability to reach its projected savings of more than $85 million a year "because no-one will have the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the angst in the pensioner community about this proposal and the very high effective rates of tax that it would impose on affected individuals, the Coalition contends that it would result in a very significant movement of pensioner assets away from listed securities to less productive and less liquid investments such as real estate and collectibles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition believes that this proposal, if permitted to go ahead, would have a similar end result as the government's luxury car tax. That is, the disincentives against pensioners' investing in listed securities would become so great that the benefit of any savings derived by the government would be more than offset by the detrimental impact on the Australian securities industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's more, this measure would encourage both current and future pensioners to dispose of productive assets to maximise their pension entitlement. This is a highly undesirable scenario at a time when Australia's savings ratio is at a record low level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's argument that this measure would result in the more equitable treatment of pensioner investments is fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only would the government's proposal mean that listed securities would be treated more harshly than investments in other areas such as real estate, art works, antiques, non-listed securities and offshore securities. It would also result in the bizarre situation whereby identical investments in identical listed securities would result in different pension entitlements under the veterans' affairs income test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to point out a number of the unforseen consequences of this hastily conceived government proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly this proposal perpetuates the questionable practice in the social security area whereby unrealised capital gains are treated as income under the income test rather than being assessed under the assets test. This approach is in stark contrast to the treatment of capital gains under taxation law. The proposal runs counter to the Senate Select Committee for Superannuation's recommendation "that the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security form a working party to examine income tax and social security legislation with a view to maximising the consistency of definitions and treatment of matters of common concern to the two systems and that the report be tabled in Parliament by the end of 1993." (December 1992: page 50).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to recognise that unrealised gains on shares are often largely illusory and based on short term, extraneous matters rather than underlying value. More than any other group, pensioners and retirees place great importance on achieving a maximum degree of certainty in relation to financial decisions. The Coalition contends this proposal would seriously undermine the certainty in investment decisions relating to listed securities for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We contend that this erosion in investor certainty, resulting from pensions being increased or reduced on a quarterly basis due to temporary fluctuations in the share market, would be the primary reason why significant numbers of pensioners would divert their financial assets away from listed securities into other often less productive avenues of investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a government was putting forward such a proposal, one would think that, at the very least, it would ensure capital gains and capital losses would be treated on an equitable basis. Pension entitlements should not change if capital losses offset capital gains over the assessment period. However the formula proposed by the government maximises capital gains (and hence pension reductions) while minimising capital losses (and pension increases).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that a pensioner may have his or her pension entitlement reduced even though there has been no net change in the capital value of the share portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also means identical managed and unmanaged investments are treated differently under the income test. Also of concern to the Coalition is the fact that pensioners with identical portfolios would be subject to differing outcome simply as a result of the arbitrary assessment dates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only would this measure result in the inequitable treatment of listed securities compared with other investments such as real estate and collectibles. It would also mean that pensioners who invest in publicly listed companies would be subject to this additional income test while those who invest in non-listed companies would not. For example, the Chairman of the Australian Stock Exchange has argued that a pensioner who invests in TNT (listed company) would be subjected to the unrealised capital gains income test while a pensioner who invests in Linfox (an unlisted company) would not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a strong argument that this proposal could have the effect of moving many small investors offshore. The Australian Stock Exchange has pointed out that unrealised capital gains on investments on overseas stock exchanges would not be subject to the veterans' affairs income test. The Australian Stock Exchange has made considerable headway recently in attracting small investors into the local share market. This proposal has the potential to discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition contends that the government's proposal to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the income test is fundamentally flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is questionable whether the estimated savings from this initiative will ever be realised, and it will not result in any greater equity or fairness in the social security income and assets test which the Coalition contents are in urgent need of a thorough review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After carefully considering this proposal in line with our pre-election commitment, we intend to move expeditiously to ensure that it is repealed prior to the government's proposed 20th September 1993 start up date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
