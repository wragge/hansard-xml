In terms of the reason for the absence of Senator Evans and Senator Cook, there are preliminary meetings of ministers that precede the APEC meeting, hence the difference in timetable of departure between Senator Evans and Senator Cook and, in turn, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). These matters are somewhat exacerbated because both ministers are in the Senate; that is the way the responsibilities turned out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate. Last year the Prime Minister solemnly swore on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> not to put up taxes. In the last budget, the now besieged Treasurer promised that his budget strategy would be achieved without resort to any new taxes. Yet only last week the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, said that the deficit strategy may involve some revenue increases.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the record, some of the views attributed to the finance minister were grievously misquoted, which he has also put on the public record. The attitude of this government is that it is very important that our debt reduction program continue. It has been frustrated and substantially affected by the actions of Senator Alston and his colleagues in this chamber, who have absolutely no policy in this regard. They can only bleat on that they would meet any debt reduction strategy through unspecified reductions in expenditure. They will not highlight which areas of expenditure they will reduce because that is far too much hard work. This government made very clear and the Prime Minister made very clear prior to the election our attitude to taxation and the mix of taxation. That was endorsed by the electorate, much to the chagrin of those opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. I refer to the continuing concern in the Australian maritime community with the standard of certain foreign vessels trading to Australia, particularly when these vessels are allowed to transit the Great Barrier Reef area. What assurance can be given to the high standard Australian shipping industry that federal government action is effective in addressing the problem of substandard ships?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2856" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The range of government initiatives aimed at tackling the problem of substandard ships is having effect in ensuring compliance with international standards and making our concerns known in the international maritime community. However, as I have noted on many occasions publicly, Australia's ability to deal with these issues is tempered by international law. We are playing an effective role in promoting ship safety and proper crewing practices. However, Australia, as a relatively small ship owning nation largely dependent on overseas shipping services, is not well placed to pursue unilateral action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure provided a major impetus in highlighting the complex problems in regulating international shipping. I have now provided the committee's chairman, Peter Morris, with a further standing reference to inquire on an ongoing basis into developments at the national and international level on issues raised in the report. The aim is for the committee to keep attention focused on improving ship standards and to maintain the momentum of concern for a safer and more responsible shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is playing a major role in implementing the government's response to the report. Last year AMSA increased its port state control inspections to cover 34 per cent of all foreign ships visiting Australian ports, well ahead of the accepted international inspection target of 25 per cent. Over 70 per cent of ships inspected were found to have had some kind of deficiency, more than half of those involving lifesaving and firefighting equipment vital to the safety of the crews on board those ships. On a number of recent occasions, AMSA has used its detention powers under the Navigation Act to prevent unsafe vessels from leaving port until identified deficiencies were rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the coastal shipping trade, I have asked the Department of Transport and Communications to review procedures under the ministerial guidelines for issuing coastal trading permits to foreign vessels. This will determine whether applicants should be required to supply more comprehensive information on the condition of the ship. When this review is completed, I will be consulting with interested parties in the industry on any proposed changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the international level, Australia is actively supporting efforts to improve the effectiveness of the International Maritime Organisation. At the IMO meeting in London last month AMSA, as Australia's representative, was re-elected, with an increased vote, as a member of the IMO council. This reflects the recognition of Australia's higher profile in the international maritime community. While substandard ships are in the minority, Australia must continue the high level of ship inspection and support for international action to rid the world of this threat to the well-being of ships' crews and to our environment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. In light of the Prime Minister's unequivocal decision not to take out private health insurance, despite the fact that he can clearly afford it, I ask: will the minister obtain an assurance from the Prime Minister that in the event of his or his family falling ill and requiring hospitalisation, they will share a room with other public patients in a public hospital after being on the requisite waiting list with other uninsured Medicare patients?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That question from Senator Herron is essentially disgraceful. It presumes that the government would interfere in how a doctor might treat a patient. If Senator Herron's question is that Mr Keating is calling himself public and not accepting the service, then it is quite a disgraceful question. It is certainly disappointing that it comes from Senator Herron because he more than most should know that what a doctor organises by way of treatment for a patient is very much something the doctor has a large say in and it is agreed between a doctor and a patient.

Does the minister support Senator Richardson's belief that high income earners, such as the Prime Minister, should take out private health insurance?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Monday of last week in Sydney I launched the second stage of the Commonwealth's community education program called stop violence against women. That program has a number of slogans. Firstly, it puts the message into the community that real men do not bash or rape women. I am pleased to say that four significant men have agreed to contribute to that campaign: Darren Mercer, Kieren Perkins, James Blundell and Don Burke. Those men are prepared to join the women of Australia in saying that violence against women is totally unacceptable. I have actually placed on the record, but I am happy to say it again, my appreciation for these men who have said that they are very happy to speak out about violence against women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage non-violent men are joining women in opposing the violent behaviour of some men in our community. I do not believe that this matter can be overlooked; it is a matter of the greatest gravity. It should be appreciated that those men have been prepared to join the government in this campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women have made it clear to us that one of their main concerns is violence against them and their children in the community. It is also clear that violence exists on a totally unacceptable and, indeed, horrific scale against women throughout Australia, as any number of demonstrations and data reveal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that stop violence against women campaign consists of this community education program where, as I said, non-violent men have joined women in opposing violence against women. The principal slogans of that campaign are: `Real men don't bash or rape women', `Violent men will lose everything' and `We will not tolerate violence against women'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Kieren Perkins said, `We all have a responsibility to stop pretending that this kind of thing does not happen, to stop making excuses for violent men and to start speaking our minds'. As Darren Mercer added, `I appeal to them and to other sportsmen and sportswomen at the launch to use their influence as role models to say to young people it isn't manly or tough to rape or bash women'. I think that is a very important slogan. The sportsmen and sportswomen do have a considerable amount to offer the community. They are models to our young people. I believe the peer pressure that they will offer by saying to violent men in the community that it is totally unacceptable will make this campaign a great step forward in terms of community education and changing attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the publicity-education campaign, I announced a program of community grants at the launch in Sydney on Monday, in Melbourne on Tuesday and in South Australia on Wednesday. We also have special projects which I have listed here before and I am happy to list them again. They include the assistance that the Office of the Status of Women is providing to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration for the development of its gender awareness programs. It also consists of assistance we are providing to the Family Court for the training of people in the court to know how best to deal with violence and the assistance we are providing to the Australian Law Reform Commission in its inquiry into equity before the law, particularly the impact of violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe we can speak too strongly against violence against women in the community. I believe this campaign is a very significant second step. It is very impressive that non-violent men are now adding their voice to the voice of women in opposing any violence against women.</PARA>

I refer the minister to the revelations about efforts by the Prime Minister to acquire a $30,000 dining table and $24,000 reproduction regency chairs for the Lodge as well as other expensive adornments for the walls of the cabinet room. Do not these revelations suggest that there is now something sadly lacking in the priorities of a Prime Minister who, as Treasurer for 10 years, boasted about his razor gang successes in cutting millions of dollars in expenditure line by line from welfare, education and health programs?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not Prime Minister Keating's initiative to purchase a table for the Lodge; that was initiated some time in 1991 by Mr Keating's predecessor's spouse. The funding involved was not taxpayers' money but money raised by the Australiana Fund, essentially through opening the Lodge to visits by members of the public. In any event, no purchase of a table proceeded. The artworks that Parliament House acquires and the overall quantum are a matter for the Presiding Officers to determine.

The Prime Minister has expressed an opinion on what he believes is appropriate for the cabinet room. It does not really involve, in the overall quantum of art acquisition in this building, increased expenditure; it is whether it goes in one particular area or another.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia did contribute 45 signallers to the UN mission for the referendum in Western Sahara&mdash;the Minurso operation&mdash;in September 1991 in support of the UN plan to conduct a referendum in which the question would be posed whether Western Sahara should be independent or part of Morocco. Since then, the parties&mdash;Morocco and the Polisario, which is the Western Sahara independence movement&mdash;have been unable to come to an agreement on voter registration and eligibility and the referendum has consequently been delayed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian deployment was originally anticipated to be for a period of 35 weeks and was not intended to be open ended. We have subsequently agreed to six-monthly rotations of the contingent because of the delays in the organisation of the referendum. In response to a request from the UN, the Australian contingent with Minurso is currently being rotated for a further six-month deployment but we have advised the UN that this will be the last rotation, and it ends in May 1994.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for what is, I believe, a very timely question. It is time that the New South Wales government and the New South Wales Adult Migrant English Service got some pretty basic facts straight and stopped running erroneous scare campaigns in New South Wales about the level of English language services not only in that state but also across the country. It is true that one unfortunate victim of this disinformation campaign is the New South Wales Teachers Federation. As the honourable senator indicated in his question, the federation has already signalled that it is considering industrial action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of disinformation on this matter is recent. On 4 November this year, the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment, Kerry Chikarovski, put out a press statement making a somewhat astounding claim that the Commonwealth had cut funding to adult ESL programs in New South Wales by some 20 per cent. She also claimed that that would necessitate a reduction of jobs in the area of some 84 positions. The New South Wales Teachers Federation, ignited by this press statement, issued a press release protesting and signalling industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth, of course, is different. If the minister, Kerry Chikarovski, and the journalists who ran her press release had bothered to check, they would have seen that her claims were wrong. Rather than decrease, Commonwealth expenditure on adult ESL programs for New South Wales residents has substantially increased as a result of 1992-93 budget decisions. ESL funding in New South Wales over the 1992-94 triennium is: 1992, $37.3 million, with $34.5 million coming from my department and $2.8 million coming from DEET; 1993, $43.1 million, with $25.7 million from my department and $17.4 million from DEET; and 1994, $42.1 million, with $20.1 million from Immigration and $22 million from DEET. Of these state figures, Commonwealth funding to the New South Wales Adult Migrant English Service over the 1992-94 triennium is expected to be: in 1992, $31 million; in 1993, $35.6 million; and in 1994, $31 million.</PARA>

Secondly, will the minister advise the Senate as to the present situation in respect of the proposed Australian human rights delegation to Vietnam which was agreed during Prime Minister Kiet's visit to Australia earlier this year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Mrs Betteridge has been treated appallingly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Senate should continue to pursue this matter to ensure that she ultimately receives the apology that she deserves. What happened in relation to the Thai mahogany table was that Mrs Betteridge was directed to the Prime Minister's friend Mr Kenny in search of this table. When this became a political embarrassment to the Prime Minister, he decided that the staff member of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet concerned, Mrs Betteridge, should be the one that took the rap. That is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister went on the John Laws program to dob her in. Through that program, he firstly wanted to make clear to the Australian people that it was Mrs Betteridge who found the table and that he had nothing to do with it. He was specifically asked by John Laws:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who found one?</PARA>
<PARA>This is referring to the table. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, it was found by, I think in the first instance, the person you mentioned, Ms Betteridge.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no mention of the Prime Minister's involvement at all. The interview continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JL: She found the table to begin with?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PM: Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>The second half of the exercise involved the Prime Minister's embarrassment when he was forced to return the table because it was outside the guidelines of the Australiana Fund. Rather than face up to that responsibility himself, it was again Mrs Betteridge who took the blame. John Laws specifically asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why did she then disapprove of it?</PARA>
<PARA>Again this is referring to the purchase of this table. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, I think this is the revenge of the `hyphenated names'.</PARA>
<PARA>The interview further continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JL: Why did Margaret Betteridge change her mind?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PM: I think that a bit of peer group pressure probably got to her. That is, some of the other hyphens on the committee suggested it wasn't ideologically pure enough.</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence before us now demonstrates that the Prime Minister was deliberately misleading the Australian people in those answers, at a cost to Mrs Betteridge. He had no concern as to her position in this matter whatsoever. I remind honourable senators, to put the matter in context, that the Prime Minister, being unhappy with Mrs Betteridge and wanting to demonstrate that she should take the rap, telephoned her and, to use his words, expressed his disquiet about the serious inaccuracies and reflections on his role in this matter, after which Mrs Betteridge felt that she had no alternative but to accept voluntarily retirement from the department. </PARA>

<PARA>This was the Prime Minister directing Mrs Betteridge to go to Mr Kenny. I move to her next minute, dated 14 December 1992, in which she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has previously discussed this matter with him. Mr Kenny has seen the dinning room at The Lodge and is aware of the issues involved.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>

In a doorstop interview Mr Keating complained that other people in his position&mdash;the John Curtins, Ben Chifleys and Robert Menzies&mdash;were not subjected to this sort of critique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would make is that the John Curtins, Ben Chifleys, Robert Menzies and Malcolm Frasers simply did not involve themselves in the type of activities that Mr Keating is involving himself in. I cannot believe that Ben Chifley or John Curtin would have been remotely worried about the artwork on the cabinet wall, or would have been the slightest bit concerned about the quality of the dining table at the Lodge, or would have spent hours looking at the quality of lights for the dining room&mdash;all at great cost to the taxpayer, I might say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very great concern in the community&mdash;amongst not only people on our side of the parliament but also Labor supporters&mdash;that we have a man who sees his role as Prime Minister in rather an imperial way, and as meaning that he can act in an arbitrary way without proper processes. We have seen this in relation to the staffing at the Lodge where four or five members of the Prime Minister's staff have been moved on or dismissed since he came there and, as far as I can see&mdash;particularly in the three recent cases which were brought before the estimates committee&mdash;all without the reasonable due process that one would expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one queries the Prime Minister's right to choose whoever he wants to be his personal staff, but no-one has the right not to treat these people fairly and with decency. He should have acted in a way in which most Australians&mdash;and one would have thought particularly a Labor Prime Minister who lectures so ceaselessly to the private sector all the time&mdash;would have acted in relation to these people who were dismissed. The pattern of behaviour that we are seeing here is causing great concern on the Labor side of the parliament that Mr Keating is not a true Labor man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister constantly harks back to the true believers, but the true believers would be devastated by the number of unemployed and homeless in this country. That is what the true believers would be concerned about. They would not be worried about Gould prints in the cabinet room, nor would they be worried about whether or not the butler is wearing striped pants when he serves dinner at the Lodge. I do not believe that any Prime Minister in this country would be remotely worried about those things, but not so Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked this question of Senator Ray, I must admit I was a bit concerned, because Senator Robert Ray is well known as a man who does not speak to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister does not speak to Senator Ray. Therefore, it is probably a bit unfair to press Senator Ray for the Prime Minister's opinion on some issue. But I asked Senator Ray what I thought was a reasonable question: rather than spending an additional $100,000 on Gould prints for Mr Keating's cabinet room, would it not have been better to think how this money could have been better spent? If $100,000 is available to indulge the artistic taste of Mr Keating, maybe $100,000 is available to help with emergency relief for families who find themselves without food, who are homeless and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question which I believe only the modern Labor Party would have difficulty in answering. If we were to ask any traditional Labor person&mdash;and, indeed, any person on this side&mdash;where $100,000 would be better spent in this current climate, none of them would have any difficulty whatsoever in answering.

She is able to do that under the entitlements which have been made available to all federal members of parliament. But do not tell me she is going around to every one of those Liberal Party meetings talking about her parliamentary duties; she is purely talking about her desire to become leader of the Liberal Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to the crunch in the last three days, that all went out the window. When he counted up the numbers he found that the Western Australian Liberal Party, the John Howard group and Bronwyn's group&mdash;whoever want to put their hands up for Bronwyn&mdash;were against him and he realised that he no longer had the support.

<PARA>The question which I asked today of Senator Collins was the first question he has been allowed to answer on Mabo. Of course, we know what happened: he gave a non-answer completely. My question was very specific. I will quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 November.

Those procedures provide flexibility to acknowledge the kind of evidence that has been taken, the circumstances in which it has been taken and the land rights. Of course, it was oversighted by very distinguished judges of the Federal Court. One of the judges, the first in fact, is now a distinguished member of the High Court&mdash;the Hon.

I recall one hearing at South Alligator River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing&mdash;and this is what I am saying to Senator Panizza&mdash;is that this is nothing radical, unique or new. These opportunities already exist in the court system. Although that additional flexibility is provided for, the fundamental fairness on which the rule of law operates in Australia and on which courts operate in Australia continues to operate under that system. So Senator Panizza has nothing to fear from that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate, because it is relevant, that Senator Panizza, coming from Western Australia, would do far better directing his attention to prevailing upon his Western Australian colleagues to remove from the parliament the totally obnoxious piece of legislation on native title they have introduced. The central clause in that legislation is clause 7, which purports to provide a blanket extinguishment of native title, despite the fact that the High Court has ruled that it is now part of the common law of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add that that legislation has been assailed by a number of people among whom&mdash;I would have thought Senator Panizza would have paid some attention to this&mdash;are three distinguished former members of the coalition's front bench. Peter Durack, a former federal Attorney-General, has comprehensively attacked these proposals, as have Fred Chaney and Ian Viner QC, both former ministers for aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Viner described the Western Australian legislation as being discriminatory and racially based. But more importantly and correctly, Ian Viner said that the bill will utterly fail to provide the certainty which everybody in Australia is demanding because it does breach the Racial Discrimination Act.

As soon as question time was over and the proceedings were no longer being broadcast, Senator Collins came back into the chamber and answered the question. I think that reflects very badly on the way most ministers in this place behave. </PARA>

<PARA>The annual report, as is usually the case with EPAC, is a useful document. It summarises the role of EPAC over the last year in terms of the forum it provides for the discussion and consideration of various matters of economic policy and economic planning in Australia. It plays a very useful role in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report details the work in which the council has been involved in the last year. During that time it has undertaken and participated in some very important work on issues of national importance, including the FitzGerald national savings review, the Hilmer competition policy review, the Treasury retirement incomes modelling task force and the Dr Michael Keating employment opportunities task force. As well, the council has been asked by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to act as a sounding board for the ideas being developed by the employment opportunities task force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the report understandably fails to point out is that whilst the issues of competition, national savings and employment creation&mdash;the matters that it has been dealing with over the last year&mdash;are imperative to our nation's success, the present government has done nothing to act upon these reports and nothing substantively to resolve and tackle these national issues. We had a classic example of the lack of resolve by the government in terms of necessary reforms in the last 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to today's press reports, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) was rolled yesterday on the issue of postal reform. The budget increased the deficit and, therefore, Australia's national debt rather than reducing it. This is despite all the fine rhetoric of the government in terms of its economic aspirations. Far from moving towards the reduction of deficits and the reduction of the national debt, the government's policies have moved in quite the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite Mr Keating's pledge on election night to get  people back to work, Australia is still choking with an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. The government is very deeply divided over a wide range of major policy issues, the most important of which is economic policy. In the last few days we have seen a major split within the government between its two major economic ministers on the future direction of tax and expenditure policies in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the now besieged and discredited statement of the Treasurer after the last election, when he said, `I emphasise that this will be achieved without resort to any new taxes.' That was a similar commitment to the one made by the Prime Minister late last year when he was blatantly attempting to buy votes prior to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of days we have had major conflicting statements by the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) over future tax rises. It is only a week ago that the Minister for Finance said that the deficit strategy may involve some revenue increases, though the government would be very cautious about introducing any substantial tax increases. He made it quite clear that it was a prospect in the government's mind to increase taxes, yet the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, said on the other hand that the government was opposed to future tax increases and that these would not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fine work of organisations such as EPAC, when a government is as divided over major policy issues and the fundamental direction of economic policy as this government is, it is no wonder the economy is in the state that it is in.

<PARA>It is particularly relevant at this time to be looking at this report since the government is saying, `Well, the recession is over and we are coming out of the worst of it.' It is relevant to actually look at what has happened as a consequence of this government's mismanagement of the economy. I recommend this report to anybody who is interested in seeing the consequences of economic mismanagement. It is a very well prepared report, there is a wide range of information available and it is easily identified by the casually interested reader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to page 45 in the chapter dealing with the causes of bankruptcy. On that page there is a list of the major causes of bankruptcy for business bankrupts. Of the 11 causes listed&mdash;including lack of capital, lack of business ability, failure to keep proper books and so on&mdash;the one factor which stands out as having a much greater influence than any other on bankruptcy is economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know who has the greatest capacity to influence economic conditions. I do not say for one minute that the government is responsible for everything that goes wrong in the nation in terms of the economy. No-one is so stupid to put that proposition. But the federal government has the greatest capacity to influence the economy. The consequence of this mismanagement is that more and more people have been going bankrupt. </PARA>

The report says that 35.6 per cent of business bankruptcies are identified not by the bankrupts but by the official receivers and registered trustees as being caused by economic conditions and a further 15.7 per cent of bankruptcies have economic conditions as a contributing factor. So the government is definitely damned by the economic statistics that are contained in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw attention to a number of areas in the report, particularly the special investigations which have been undertaken by the Office of the Inspector-General and the investigations which have been made in relation to a number of named entities, for example the World Corp International Pty Ltd, World Corp International Pty Ltd (Consultancy), World Corp International (WA), Ascot Credit Assist Pty Ltd and National Assist, which is a division of World Corp International Pty Ltd (Consultancy). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about all of these entities is that they are corporations; therefore, they cannot be trustees of a person's estate either in bankruptcy or under part 10 of the act.

They are saying, `Let us come in and we will rearrange the debtors affairs, spare him from bankruptcy and benefit the creditors.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know from my experience, having worked in the field of insolvency, that in many cases these people fail to deliver on any of these promises. It is not as though this is a new phenomenon. Groups of people like these have been in practice in this field for some time. This report quite correctly says that a frequent consequence of their actions is that the debtors eventually end up bankrupt and with higher debts and greater hardship than before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this goes to show that there are always vultures and people in society who are willing to prey on those who are unable, for whatever reason, to extricate themselves out of the mess in which they find themselves. For example, the report says that frequently these groups utilise court listings or mercantile gazettes to establish the name, address and details of debtors and then go to them with a proposal. That is worse than ambulance chasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are legitimate practitioners who work in this area. But a legitimate practitioner should almost invariably be either a solicitor, who has the power to take control of a person's assets under section 188 of the act, or a registered practitioner and a trustee. They are the appropriate people who should be offering this service. It is not for private companies to make these sorts of arrangements. That would be highly dubious and highly immoral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect I want to draw to the attention of the Senate relates to the operation of section 305 of the act. Section 305 is very important because the official receiver requires trustees, upon lodgment of their annual accounts, to pay a percentage of the total realisations. That goes into a fund which is then made available to trustees and official receivers to fund speculative actions under section 305. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the average amount paid out is in the vicinity of $108,000. However, one per cent of the annual realisations of $18 million is about $180,000. So it would appear on first reading&mdash;and I may be totally wrong&mdash;that substantially more is going into the fund than is being used or made available to trustees to meet the costs of an action. That concerns me because these moneys are utilised to fund investigations into highly dubious estates&mdash;for example, the estate of Mr Skase, the estate of Dr Edelsten which, from recollection, was subject to a section 305 application, and numerous others. In fact, I prepared many of them myself. At this point I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>If one read this report one would never realise that this was the worst year ever in the history of the Civil Aviation Authority or any of its predecessors. I will just touch lightly on some of the significant `achievements' of this authority during the last year. We saw, first of all, the collapse of a major contract&mdash;the TAAATS contract. We saw an independent review into that contract which found against the CAA. In effect, it found considerable maladministration and incompetence; so much so that the government directed the CAA to start again from scratch with a clean sheet of paper and run the whole exercise properly, and that is still in train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the resignation of the chief executive officer, Mr Baldwin, who mismanaged the whole process so badly that he had to go. He and his henchman, Dr Edwards, departed to the country that they came from. But apparently along the way they each left with a six figure sum as compensation for their mismanagement. One can look in vain in this report to find any entry in the balance sheets for the notional `compensation' paid to them for the non-completion of their appointments. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the resignation of the chairman of the CAA. He was allowed to resign without any censure for the mismanagement of his part in the TAAATS contract. We have seen the disaffection of the aviation industry reach greater heights than we have ever seen before. We have seen disaffection within the parliament with the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently a large number of answers given to the first Senate estimates inquiry this year were incorrect. I well remember being on an aircraft flying to Brisbane the Friday morning after the hearing and reading about all these allegations of incorrect information being given to a Senate committee. That is absolutely inexcusable; we cannot have that from senior public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not able to get to the second Senate estimates committee hearing, which was held last night. A marathon effort was put in by Senator Ian MacDonald, but in the part I saw at least one very misleading statement was given by a senior CAA officer to the Senate committee. I will deal with that in due course later this week and put the facts before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a continuation of the gross abuse of power by the Civil Aviation Authority in a regulatory field. I spoke about this repeatedly when amendments to the Civil Aviation Act were before us. I was always assured by Senator Collins that the officers of the CAA would never abuse the great powers that the parliament has given it&mdash;literally powers to kick in someone's door without a warrant, seize documents, harass people and summarily remove licences from them. But we have seen gross abuse of powers time and time again over the last 12 months. This gross abuse of power has a major effect on people in the industry. It also has a bad effect on the reputation of the CAA. There are a lot of decent people in the CAA. A lot of them do not do what they should do&mdash;that is, firmly exercise authority&mdash;because they do not want to be lumped in with the few abusive characters who are in the regulatory authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen people taken to court when in many cases all that is required is a fatherly talk to them to put them right on where they are going wrong. The CAA has a habit of picking on the rabbits&mdash;the small people; the individuals. It does not go after the really bad operators in the industry who stand up to it and offer to fight it in court. I think the cost of legal action that the CAA is involved in&mdash;I was pleased to see that Senator Macdonald asked for a figure on that last night&mdash;would be astronomical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald instanced the case of the pilot who, in a mercy operation, flew a pregnant woman from the floods in Longreach and who, as a consequence, spent three years in court. I have heard of a case in Queensland where the CAA tried to sue someone for dropping oranges on someone else's house, and it lost that case. The summary withdrawal of licences and the denial of people's livelihood is endless. Then we had the great debacle of the airspace mismanagement on 11 November. We had senior officials of the CAA going on television, ridiculing their critics and saying that the CAA would go ahead. Now they have backed down. There are advertisements in the paper every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA is very important to Australia. It is going through a very bad period but the public and the parliament's patience is now almost totally exhausted with its incompetence. It has to get its act together and do so quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note what the chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority said about safety regulations in his review in the report which was tabled today. As my colleague Senator MacGibbon has mentioned, the Senate estimates committee sat quite late last night in its second round of hearings into matters involving the CAA, specifically matters relating to safety matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated last night at the estimates committee meeting, I am at somewhat of a disadvantage in inquiring about matters of safety relating to the CAA because I do not have the technical experience or background to understand all the terms and implications. But I can say that there has been an increasing swell of opinion in recent times about concern for safety in the skies over Australia. My colleague Senator MacGibbon has raised that on many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inquired into safety aspects at the original hearings of the Senate estimates committee, particularly because of my interest in the crash of the aircraft at Young in June this year. As a result of those original inquiries, certain information was given to me. Subsequent to that inquiry, it was suggested to me by many independent observers that the answers that I had been given were not quite factual. There was no suggestion that there was a deliberate attempt to mislead the Senate, but rather suggestions of incompetence and simply not knowing the situation and not knowing the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We received some information last night. I was given some categorical assurances by officers and by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins). I regret to say that it has been suggested to me this morning that those assurances are not quite accurate. I do not make judgments at this time, but they are matters that we are pursuing. Should that turn out to be the case, the Senate will hear a lot more about it. I did ask some questions. Bearing in mind that this matter is sub judice, I was not too specific about the crash at Young. I asked for information about whether Monarch Airlines had sought assistance from the CAA and whether that assistance had been given or refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked about planned surveillance of regional airline operations in New South Wales and for assurances that surveillance would be carried out. I asked some questions about whether an officer of the CAA was aware before the crash that the autopilot had been removed from that aircraft. I was given answers and I accept them as they stand at this particular time, but it has been suggested to me that there may need to be follow-up questioning on some of those matters; the suggestion being, again, that perhaps I have not been given&mdash;can I say in the politest words&mdash;the full story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also interested to hear that in recent times there have been four inquiries at different levels into the safety of the airline system in Australia. Information is to come to me on just how many inquiries into safety there have been over the years. It was suggested to me by Senator Collins that this proves how conscious the CAA is of safety matters. Of course, there is another interpretation&mdash;and this is the concern that is raised with me by people in the know and in the industry&mdash;that while there have been many inquiries into air safety nothing is ever really done to implement the recommendations of those particular inquiries. We will be looking at that a fraction further when I get the results of the information from the Senate estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply raise again, in talking to this report, questions of air safety in Australia. I should also mention the case in Longreach that was briefly referred to by my colleague Senator MacGibbon where a man was prosecuted for apparently flying without a licence to pick up a woman in dire need of urgent medical treatment in a flood. Senator MacGibbon mentioned the facts, but he did not mention that the matter went to a trial by jury and the pilot defended himself and was acquitted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will respond to his earlier attack on the CAA&mdash;he has a 20-year history of attacking the CAA and its predecessors and so this is not a recent phenomenon.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Senator MacGibbon carried on at length during the matters of public interest debate in the last sitting week. He talked about the appalling new procedures that the CAA had introduced with briefing for pilots. He made an assertion&mdash;totally without foundation, as I subsequently discovered&mdash;that there are now only two operators to cover the whole of Australia in terms of pilots getting briefings over the new computerised system. I am not a pilot and I am not an engineer. I am, as I described myself last night, a professional passenger and nothing else, but because I am used to Senator MacGibbon's garbage, I immediately checked it out. There are, in fact, 16 operators, not two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that I availed myself of the codes to access the system and put in a putative flight plan from Alice Springs to Darwin.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that&mdash;Senator MacGibbon might be interested in this although he never is because 90 per cent of what he says turns out to be factual garbage&mdash;I then rang the 008 number which is also provided and had a very interesting talk with the CAA operator who looks after all of those computer banks. He was obviously a long-term CAA employee. When I told him about some of the allegations that Senator MacGibbon had raised, he laughed and said, `What utter rubbish'. The cold, hard facts are that in the so-called good old days, which Senator MacGibbon referred to, even with the briefing officers, the majority of pilots still got their briefs over the telephone. The huge advantage of this system is that one gets hard copy briefs on access by dialling a phone number. </PARA>

It is instantly accessible whenever they want it at any time before the flight without the need to go anywhere to get it'.

On this occasion&mdash;as I always do&mdash;I found out the circumstances of the case where the CAA had outrageously prosecuted this bloke. He flew an aircraft across the tops of the heads of a number of people on horseback who were mustering cattle. They were the ones who made the complaint.

In that year leading up to September 1990, of just under $600,000 spent in Western Australia, something like 85 per cent went into marginal Labor seats. This concerned me at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that when I confronted Senator Richardson, who was the minister responsible immediately prior to the 1990 election, and asked him whether or not it was interesting to note that most of the money had gone into marginal Labor seats, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would not know whether that is a correct figure or not. That would not have been a consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>With this background it is interesting to see that the Auditor-General having done a significant study into the program which, I remind the Senate, has seen in the order of $60.3 million appropriated over the past five years, and a thorough analysis of how these grants are issued&mdash;the departmental advice on which the minister relies to make the decisions as to where the money goes, any follow-up to see if the money is spent correctly and whether or not the objectives of the program are met&mdash;the result of this audit report No. 9 for 1993-94 is an uncategorical disaster for the program and the way it is administered. Specifically, the responsibility for this disaster needs to be sheeted home particularly to the current minister, Ros Kelly, and one would imagine some blame would have to be put on the head of Senator Richardson as the minister responsible prior to Minister Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having only just flipped through the report, it is worth noting a few of the comments made by the Auditor-General and some of the statistics. The Senate should know that, firstly, when these applications for grants come in from community groups and other people, the department goes through a categorisation process as to how the applications for funding stack up. They are categorised as being category 1, category 2 or category 3. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the period of review, the Auditor-General found that category 1 grants received only nine per cent of the funding and category 3 grants received 11 per cent of the funding. The importance of this is that category 1 grants are described as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . well documented with a clearly demonstrated community need satisfying all other selection criteria'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, the top rung of applications that clearly serve the interests of the program. Those in category 3 are described by the department as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . lacking in relevant information, for which community need has not been adequately demonstrated and many other selection criteria not satisfied, including evidence of other funding sources&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, the absolute bottom of the pile. The interesting thing to note from this report, of course, is that these category 3 projects receive more funding than the category 1 projects. So on that criterion alone&mdash;and I am not saying it is the only criteria for judging whether a project is good or not&mdash;it is interesting to note that the minister has approved an enormous number of projects that are just badly documented and lacking any relevance to the selection criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General notes that the statement made to me by Senator Richardson on 11 September 1990 was indeed correct, that the final decisions are made by the minister with some reference to departmental advice. The only advice is a categorisation; they end up with a series of grants in front of them and they make a selection. Basically decisions are made by the minister and personal advisers within the minister's staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Auditor-General has also spent more time going into my original allegation. That came from the fact that I figured that in that particular year 85 per cent of the money in Western Australia had gone to marginal Labor seats, particularly the seats of Canning, Swan and Stirling, which it should be noted&mdash;and I did at that time&mdash;are well-established areas and suburbs of Perth which already have well-established sporting and cultural facilities. That is not to say they could not do with more, but the fact of the matter is that this program says the money should be going into new suburbs and areas of high unemployment to provide facilities where the need is greatest. Anyone who knows the seats of Canning, Swan or Stirling knows that most of the suburbs in those areas are well established with many good sporting facilities already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn quickly to the analysis that the Auditor-General has done on where the money went in relation to the political seats. It is worth noting that at the time of the study Labor held 53 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives. It may have gone up slightly since then, but for this argument that is irrelevant. During the period of this study the Labor Party held 53 per cent of the seats in the House of Representatives and those seats received 73 per cent of the grants and 66 per cent by value. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.on average, the total value of grants to a Labor held seat was $257,000 and to a Coalition held seat $141,000, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.on average, the total value of grants to a marginal Labor held seat was $326,000 and to a marginal Coalition held seat $163,000.</PARA>
<PARA>This shows that there is enormous disparity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also provides a very handy graph, which we do not need to incorporate because it is in the report if anyone is interested. It shows quite graphically the figures spent in the year 1992-93 divided between Labor and coalition seats. It is interesting that in my home state of Western Australia no money was spent in any coalition seats and that indeed the quantum of money spent in Western Australia was nearly as high as it was in Victoria. Clearly Western Australia was a problem for the government in the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one would expect&mdash;I am sure that the minister would expect it&mdash;I would say that this whole program has become a political pork barrel; the money is shunted quite unashamedly into the seats where the marginal Labor members need to increase their popularity with the locals in the lead-up to the next election. The Auditor-General, of course, could not go so far as to say those sorts of things. On this subject the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANAO's analysis does not demonstrate one way or the other that projects are approved on party political grounds. It may be that Labor held seats are those where the need for facilities is greatest. If this were the case, proper documentation of the reasons for decisions would be able to satisfy any questions concerning the selection of approved grants.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the very fact that the Auditor-General should even raise this question shows that there is an enormous doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A one-sentence summary of what the Auditor-General report says about this is that the documentation is entirely lacking; the decision making process is not clear. It is quite clear that the minister makes the decisions and that there is very little way of auditing whether or not this program performs efficiently. But the reality of the matter is that most of the money ends up going into marginal Labor seats, so it is quite appropriate for the opposition to charge that the way in which this has been executed over the last few years amounts to a quite corrupt political pork barrel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other bad things about it is that there is no actual assessment of whether the facilities that are funded actually meet the needs. There is no follow-up. In fact, the Auditor-General points out that no financial appraisal takes place even for projects where up to a quarter of a million dollars is being spent at a time. One case study that the Auditor-General cited shows that $100,000 was spent in one year and that supplementary funding of $250,000 was sought for the next year and that was approved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case study that I refer to is on page 15 of the report. It was a joint project between two councils. As I said, $100,000 was given in 1991-92. A further quarter of a million dollars was given in 1992-93. Clearly, a member of parliament made a promise during the March 1993 election campaign. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1993 the Government made an election promise of an additional $1m for the project. The Department has put forward options to honour the Government's promise resulting in a separate appropriation for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>I find all this quite disturbing and I think the minister really does need to make a formal response to the allegations made in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, one of the other disturbing aspects raised by this report is the fact that many of the funds available under this program are not spent in the year that they are allocated. That is not unusual. In fact, I alluded to it back on 11 September 1990 in an estimates discussion. But one of the concerns is that, if there was clear evidence of using this program as a political pork barrel, which the Auditor-General has alluded to, if one were to be a smart political operator, as many of the people in the New South Wales Labor Right are regarded by the media and many others, and had a few million dollars&mdash;and in this case $2.7 million was rolled over between 1991-92 and the following year and then a further $9 million was rolled over the year after that leading into the election year&mdash;it would actually be quite advantageous, if one were going to pump 77 per cent of the funding into marginal Labor held seats, to roll as much money as possible into the last year so one could go around making a big fellow of oneself in the election year. This, unfortunately, is exactly what has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this rolling over of funds, we have also seen an additional $18.75 million on projects earmarked under the One Nation program pumped into this program as well. I remind the Senate that this program has no follow-up or evaluation as to whether or not the funds have been spent in a way that actually achieves the goals of the program. I think the goals of the program are worthy. I think to develop sporting and cultural facilities at a community level is something that money should be put into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that a large number of community organisations are desperate for funds. They have chook raffles and fetes and do an enormous amount to raise money to create cultural and sporting facilities which communities need. There are many cases where that demonstrated need, I think, deserves some Commonwealth, state and local government assistance. But there needs to be cooperation and coordination between the three tiers of government. Again, the Auditor-General points out that in almost all of these cases there is no coordination or cooperation whatsoever. The left hand is not talking to the right hand. In fact, a case study in this report shows that three different Commonwealth grants were going into the one project and this department did not know about the other two. That seems quite alarming to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in her initial response to the Auditor-General's criticisms, has said that the Commonwealth government does not want to get involved in these consultations or further evaluation because it will make administration time and costs higher and it will slow down the program. I suggest that in this case it might be a good idea to slow the process down a little to make sure that the Australian taxpayer is getting value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had my doubts back on 11 September 1990, as a naive senator going to my first estimates committee hearing. It is sad but interesting to see that the Auditor-General has confirmed all of my worst fears, almost some three years to the day later, through this damning report. We expect to see a full explanation from the minister about what she proposes to do to overcome the glaring inadequacies and what I claim has become a corrupt, political pork barrel in this program. I expect that she should respond to us as quickly as possible. </PARA>

I will try not to repeat what Senator Campbell has said, but I do urge honourable senators to carefully consider and analyse the graphs contained on pages 13 and 15 of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the graphs clearly demonstrate the concerns that Senator Campbell raised at his first Senate estimates committee hearing, as he says&mdash;that is, that this program is nothing but a political pork barrel by the Labor Party. In fact, the Auditor-General's report is a damming report on that particular aspect. As Senator Campbell has mentioned, it raises a number of very grave concerns about the purposes of this program and the political implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Auditor-General is game and courageous enough to write these sorts of reports, it is no wonder that the ANAO is being starved for funds by the current government, and made to use most of its funds to pay a huge and inflated rent to the Australian Labor Party for its premises without having sufficient funds to adequately cover all of its requirements and the roles that it is asked to perform. As I say, having seen this report, it is no wonder that the Labor Party is trying to starve the ANAO at its source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague has mentioned the political bias and the report by the Auditor-General in response to that. As Senator Campbell said, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANAO's analysis does not demonstrate one way or the other that projects are approved on party political grounds. It may be that Labor held seats are those where the need for facilities is greatest. If this were the case, proper documentation of the reasons for decisions would be able to satisfy any questions concerning the selection of approved grants. At the present time documentation is simply not available to answer such questions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is pretty obvious that the Labor Party is not interested in having proper documentation, because it would expose even more vividly the political pork-barrelling that goes on with these grants. It is interesting also to quote from the report in relation to the role of the department&mdash;the independent Public Service. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department does not believe that it has a significant role in the decision making process. Departmental officers also argued that the categorisation process was not material to the decision making process which takes place in the Minister's office. It pointed to the fact that the Minister made decisions that did not always accord with the categories allocated by the Department. The categories, therefore, had no bearing on the final outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>The department is saying that, in spite of its recommendation and suggestions, the minister is not interested. One can only wonder&mdash;and one does not have to wonder very much&mdash;what is the minister's criterion in making grants. They are made for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to mention that the application form is poorly designed and the applicant is not required to state what is expected to be achieved by the project and who is going to benefit or by when. This makes it difficult for the Auditor-General to monitor outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also goes on to say that the states believe that greater overall benefit could be achieved from available Commonwealth funds if projects were selected in consultation with the states and local authorities. If the Commonwealth government were interested in making fair and equitable grants with these funds, local governments would certainly be in the best position to advise and assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local authorities know their areas and they understand such things as which sporting or cultural facilities and recreational programs do need assistance and which are the most used. They are on the ground&mdash;they understand these things; they know the histories&mdash;but they are not even consulted. It is all done from the minister's office way down here in Canberra&mdash;not with any interest in what is right, I would suggest, but in the interest of how many votes the Labor Party could get from an appropriate and timely presentation of a cheque in a marginal electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report goes on to highlight that the program has unclear objectives. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the program is trying to achieve is not entirely clear. There is some discrepancy between the objectives of the program as stated in the program guidelines sent to applicants and those stated in the Program Performance Statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The uncertainty surrounding the objectives of the program is further complicated when an additional $18.75m was allocated to the program from funds originally earmarked for the `One Nation' program.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that the One Nation program&mdash;and this is being confirmed more and more as time goes on and as we look back in history&mdash;was simply one big buy by the Labor Party to get votes for an election which it knew was going to be difficult and which most of the Labor Party people themselves thought they were going to lose. The One Nation program, as history has shown, is simply a big vote buying exercise by the Labor Party. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the Treasurer's press release at the time, the major thrust of the re-allocation of the `One Nation' funds was to quickly spend additional funds and deliver rapid job growth.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems odd and unusual for a community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program. So the objectives are unclear. I suggest there is not much doubt about the clarity of the Labor Party's objective in this program, which is to buy votes in marginal electorates. If any further confirmation is required from this report, I suggest that honourable senators look at this further quotation from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has attempted to tighten up the guidelines and administration of the program on several occasions but Ministers have generally not accepted the departmental recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the ministers would not be interested. The department would want them to do it fairly and squarely but the minister is only interested in the vote buying aspect. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has advised that she always has regard to departmental advice but does not always follow that advice.</PARA>
<PARA>That is interesting. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case ANAO believes this has contributed to administrative and effectiveness difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>The ANAO, as is its way, sends a draft report to the department and to the minister for comment. The response by the secretary to the department can only be described as equivocal and it really does not buy into the subject at all. The responses from the minister are quite interesting, though. The minister says that she believes that `the audit had gone well outside its own guidelines'. There we are: shoot the messenger&mdash;if you do not like the message then criticise the messenger. The minister is saying, `They weren't supposed to be looking into these things'. I can understand that the minister would be concerned that the audit office had looked into these claims of political bias. And so it goes. It is a report which goes to the whole question of fairness and of this government's propriety in its dealings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of conclusion I will refer to the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program operations that are set out in diagram form on page 8, which makes for interesting reading. The applications are received, acknowledged and categorised by the department&mdash;although the minister takes no notice. They are then sent to the minister's office. Grants are selected by the minister; the department is advised; and submissions are prepared by the department for formal approval by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the applications are successful, the minister advises the applicants. Then the process goes on and the grant is eventually paid&mdash;usually by a Labor Party flunkey at the electorate level. However, when the applications are unsuccessful, who is it that advises them? It is not the minister and not the Labor Party local member; the department wears the odium of advising unsuccessful applicants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge honourable senators to carefully look at this report. It is, like many of the reports coming from the Auditor-General at this time, damning of the Labor Party and the way it uses public funds to buy votes at election time. It is a report that I believe should be read and understood by all senators and, I would hope, by members of the wider community. </PARA>

<PARA>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia annual report is a very comprehensive document. I do not want to address the detail in it at this stage, but I will make a few points about the ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. The Commonwealth Bank was one of the first government business enterprises to be partially privatised. That was done in 1990 or 1991 when the government agreed to privatise the bank to the tune of 30 per cent. The government has subsequently moved a step towards further privatisation with an additional 19 per cent to be sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank has proved to be, I think, a resounding success. For the first 30 per cent privatised, almost 200,000 ordinary Australians decided to invest in the bank. Most of them have made a very handsome return on their shares. The shares have almost doubled in value since their listing in 1991. That listing, along with the likes of GIO and Woolworths, has encouraged many more Australians to take up direct share ownership than had formerly been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes such a development. It was and remains a major plank of coalition policy to privatise most, if not all, of the enterprises still owned by the government, of which there are many. Privatisation has a range of benefits. In particular, the more that Australians take a direct interest in the shares of their workplaces and national companies, the better. It brings Australians closer to understanding firms and the workings of business and it gives them a very important stake and, therefore, incentive in their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has a considerable related advantage in removing the `them' and `us' attitude for the categorisation of people that some trade unions in particular, but also members of the Labor Party, have insisted on promoting for very many years. That is absolute nonsense and it is quite contrary to the egalitarian nature of our nation. The privatisation of government owned enterprises is very important in that respect, even aside from the generally enormous improvements in efficiency and competition that the privatisation process brings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only hope that this government will move further to exit its 51 per cent remaining interest in the Commonwealth Bank. Unfortunately, there is a major ideological hang-up within the Labor Party on this matter, although one can hold out some hope for gradual education in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember two or three years ago when privatisation to the tune of 30 per cent was mooted and introduced. There was never going to be any further privatisation under this government, so the government said, and that was enshrined in legislation. We see that, basically, financial expediency and the inability of the government to rein in its own expenditure and to get its budget in order were the prime motivators for the additional 19 per cent privatisation that has occurred in recent months. Nevertheless, the point is that there has been that further privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now down to 51 per cent government ownership and I would urge the government to consider going further and indeed exiting completely from its ownership of the Commonwealth Bank. There is no justification at all for the Australian taxpayer to continue to hold an interest in this bank or, for that matter, in most other government business enterprises. Government owned enterprises should be privatised so that all Australians can decide for themselves whether they wish to invest in these companies. Australians can build their own investment nest eggs and, in the process, add to national savings and individual financial independence. </PARA>

The government has been stifled on this issue as it has with such other key areas as industrial relations, tax reform and other micro-economic reforms. The government must surely take notice of the success of privatisation, not just from the fiscal point of view but also, as I have intimated, from the point of view of the national significance of the other reforms that are necessary&mdash;industrial relations reform and reform to encourage savings and investment in this country&mdash;if we are to develop the increasingly efficient and internationally competitive nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a per premises charge to be levied on domestic meat establishments in those States and Territories where the Commonwealth's meat inspection agency the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service or AQIS for short, is responsible for inspecting domestic meat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Bill is the first part of a package of legislation to be introduced, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has asked me to spend some time on the context, objectives and impacts of the whole package before returning to the details of this particular Bill. You will also see that the Senate's imposed deadlines for the passage of legislation through the House of Representatives, impact on the package of measures and the timing of their introduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1993 Budget, the Government announced a major program of reform of AQIS to reduce its cost to Australian industry while retaining the integrity of Australia's inspection functions. The Government wants to make it clear that AQIS fulfils an essential role in protecting Australia against the importation of exotic pests and diseases and inspecting food for safety and overseas country requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This role must continue but the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy believes it can be done more efficiently at lower cost to Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program of reform of AQIS which is designed to give the organisation a much stronger business orientation, has three major elements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First AQIS will be reflecting the Government's intention to actively encourage Australian industry to take more responsibility for quality assurance from production, through processing and distribution, to consumption. Industry will benefit from quality assurance by adopting modern technology, and processing systems giving much better control of their products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, to improve the efficiency of service delivery to industry and to cap and reduce inspection costs, AQIS will be restructured over the next three to four years with a projected decline of 650 Commonwealth and 100 State AQIS personnel via retrenchments on a voluntary basis wherever possible. To place this in perspective AQIS currently employs around 2,000 Commonwealth and 600 State permanent staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, a package of new charging legislation will be introduced to provide for a uniform, three tiered charging regime for AQIS services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To implement this new charging regime across all AQIS services to export, import and domestic industries, a considerable package of new legislation is expected to be introduced to the House of Representatives late in the Budget session with passage through the Senate in the autumn session. With the exception of the meat industry, implementation of the new three tiered charge regime across the industries AQIS services will be on or after 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction of the three tiered charging regime is essential if charges are to be acceptable and equitable across all users whether their inspection services are based on quality assurance methods or traditional end point inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three tiers of the new charge structure comprise:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first tier, a fixed annual charge per premises at which activity is conducted,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">second tier, a throughput or volume charge on relevant products,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">third tier, a charge per inspector per unit of time, or a charge per inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third tier inspection charge aims to recover the variable costs of AQIS field inspection activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first and second tier charges between them aim to recover the balance of AQIS chargeable costs which tend by their nature to be fixed in the short to medium term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three tiered charging regime allows for the separation and identification of AQIS field and other costs. It contrasts sharply with present AQIS charges the bulk of which are set on an average, per inspector per unit of time basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objectives of the three tiered approach to the pricing of AQIS services are efficiency, equity, consistency, transparency and simplicity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To meet the efficiency objective, economic theory suggests that the marginal cost of additional inspection resources equates with the price industry pays to deploy them as it will with third tier charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For equity, the three tiered cost recovery regime provides a fairer allocation of the costs to be recovered from firms participating in the industry particularly when quality assurance methods become more widespread.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AQIS costs will be measured and applied consistently across industries with the application of the three tiered regime which is based on common principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a public monopoly providing regulatory services, AQIS needs to be able to justify its pricing policies to its clients. It also needs to make its costs and recoveries visible to them. Taken together these imply transparency and simplicity to which the three tiered charging regime contributes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However due to the shortness of time made available by the Senate for the drafting and introduction of Budget bills and to ensure that the Government's reform plans for the domestic and export meat industries and their associated charging structures are introduced progressively from 1 January 1994 as planned, the Government is currently introducing two Bills for passage of both the House and the Senate in the Budget sittings relating solely to the domestic and export meat industry charging arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I stated initially the purpose of the Bill before us is to provide for a first tier, per premises charge to be levied on domestic meat establishments. The second Bill whose introduction will follow immediately, makes consequential changes to the name and coverage of the collection act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes to domestic and export meat charges including an export meat premises charge to be made on 1 January 1994, can be made by amending the relevant subordinate legislation of other Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second tier, throughput charge for export and domestic meat is not proposed for introduction until 1 July 1994 so its imposition has been included in the full package of AQIS charging legislation due to be introduced late in these Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning now to the financial impact of the three tiered charge regime and the other changes proposed on the meat industry, the estimated revenues I will discuss are all expressed in today's dollars and using accrual accounting concepts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994-95 the first full year of the three tiered charging system, AQIS revenue from the domestic and export meat industry is expected to be around $78.2 million which will include a maximum of $13.2 million in premises charges. This compares with meat inspection revenue of $80.6 million in both 1992-93 and 1993-94. Revenue is expected to fall in subsequent years reaching $70.5 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the premises charges are introduced on 1 January 1994, the annual cost of meat inspection staff is expected to fall from a base rate of $69,169 to $65,164. The base rate is expected to fall further to $59,164 on 1 July 1994. This will honour the Government's dual pledges not to increase the costs of inspection staff and to reduce the total costs of inspection services by AQIS to the meat industry by $10 million over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue from first tier premises charges on domestic meat establishments is estimated by AQIS to total $1.1 million in 1993-94 and $2.2 million in 1994-95 the first full year of its operation. As previously explained, the revenue collected from the premises charge will be offset by a reduction in the revenue from the third tier inspection charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators this Bill and the foreshadowed amendment Bill are part of major and worthwhile reforms to AQIS and the charging regime for its services. The reform of AQIS charging regimes will be completed when the full package of legislation is introduced late in the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and I present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will give effect to three changes announced in the 1993-94 Budget. One change will provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1993-94 income year. Another will exempt from income tax income derived by non-profit organisations established for the purpose of promoting the development of tourism. The third change will provide sales tax exemption for goods used in various activities of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes changes to the imputation system as a result of the reduction in the company tax rate, for 1993-94 and later years of income, from 39 per cent to 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill makes a number of amendments to the method of calculating and apportioning certain deductions allowable to life assurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also amends the capital gains tax provisions so that they do not apply to capital gains and losses realised on the disposal of policies of life assurance, or rights under policies of life assurance, by complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also amend the provisional tax provisions of the taxation law to maintain the current uplift factor of 8 per cent for the calculation of provisional tax for the 1993-94 year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also incorporates three amendments moved by the Government in the other place. These relate to deductions for the capital cost of establishing grape vines, sales tax exemption for childcare services, and a minor technical change to the sales tax law to clarify the operation of penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other changes are proposed to the petroleum mining provisions, fringe benefits tax, superannuation guarantee charge and petroleum resource rent tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes several technical amendments to the taxation law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to a more detailed discussion of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deferral of initial payment of company tax</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give effect to the announcement in the 1993-94 Budget of relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1993-94 year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The companies affected are those with a tax liability of $1,000 or more but less than $300,000, and which pay their tax in two instalments. The due date for the initial payment will be deferred by nine weeks from the 28th day of the month following the balance date to the 28th day of the third month following the balance date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for previous deferrals in the 1990-91 and 1991-92 income years, the amendments will ensure that franking deficit tax and franking credits and debits will be determined as if there had been no deferral of the initial tax payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure will defer revenue of $10 million from the 1993-94 year of income.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With effect from 1 July 1993, income derived by non-profit organisations established for the purpose of promoting the development of tourism will be exempt from income tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with that change, special fringe benefits tax arrangements, which provide some organisations with a tax rebate of 48 per cent of their fringe benefits tax liability, will be extended to non-profit, non-government tourism industry organisations. This rebate will apply to relevant organisations from 1 April 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will have no effect on revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Sales tax exemption for RSPCA</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as part of the 1993-94 Budget the Treasurer announced a change to the sales tax legislation to provide exemption for goods used in various activities of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change will provide an exemption from sales tax on goods used by the various State, Territory and national bodies that comprise the group of organisations known as the RSPCA, mainly in carrying out their inspectorial functions and the operation of animal shelters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption will not extend to goods used mainly in their commercial activities such as boarding kennels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments, which apply from 13 March 1993, will cost the revenue approximately $500,000 in 1993-94 and later years. In addition there will be refunds of tax paid from 13 March 1993 to 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Dividend imputation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains changes to the imputation system as a result of the reduction in the company tax rate, for 1993-94 and later years of income, from 39 per cent to 33 per cent as announced in the Investing in the Nation statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the reduction companies may have unused imputation credits arising from tax paid at the higher rate. In order to allow companies to pass on to their shareholders the full value of any imputation credits for tax paid at the 39 per cent rate, the imputation system will now operate using dual franking accounts instead of the existing single account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly, there will be one account for tax paid at the 39 per cent rate and another for tax paid at the 33 per cent rate. The 39 per cent account will operate in respect of any surplus 39 per cent credits at the time of the rate reduction, any franked dividends received that have 39 per cent credits attached to them and any further payments of tax that may be made at the 39 per cent rate as a result of, say, amended assessments for years when that rate applied.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will give effect to the measures announced in the Treasurer's Press Release of 31 May 1993. These measures concern amendments to certain formulas in the tax law which enable the tax payable by a life assurance company to be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formulas provide for the calculation of the amount of specific deductions to be allowed to a life assurance company and the apportionment of those and other deductions against the differently taxed classes of income of a life assurance company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The formulas are based on income derived by a life assurance company. One amount of income presently included in the formulas arises as a result of a life  assurance company agreeing to pay the tax liability of a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a facility instituted for the ease of administration of superannuation funds. It operates by a life assurance company agreeing to include in its assessable income an amount which otherwise would be taxable income of a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inclusion of these transferred amounts in the formulas has an adverse effect on the tax payable by a life assurance company. This was never intended to be the case and will now be corrected by an amendment to exclude these transferred amounts from the formulas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amounts will be included in the formula which apportions deductions to the differently taxed classes of income of a life assurance company. These other amounts represent the premiums received by a company which are treated as assessable income of the company for the purpose of calculating its allowable deductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the inclusion of these other amounts increases allowable deductions they should also be taken into account in apportioning those deductions to the differently taxed classes of income. The inclusion of these premiums in the apportionment formula will provide a fairer allocation of deductions to the respective classes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will amend the capital gains tax provisions so that they do not apply to capital gains and losses realised on the disposal of policies of life assurance, or rights under policies of life assurance, by complying superannuation funds, approved deposit funds or pooled superannuation trusts, whether or not the fund or trust is the "original beneficial owner" of the policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will ensure that the taxation treatment of capital gains from life assurance policies realised by superannuation funds and similar bodies is consistent with their general concessional taxation treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed exemption will apply to disposals of policies of life assurance taking place during or after the year of income in which 1 July 1988 occurred. It will therefore  apply with effect from the income year in which the current provisions relating to the taxation of superannuation and related business contained in Part IX of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 took effect.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income earned by Australian companies from carrying on a business in certain overseas locations is presently exempt from tax in Australia. However, a technical defect in the petroleum mining provisions could allow Australian petroleum mining companies to claim deductions for expenditure incurred in exploration and mining activities in these locations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of `stand-by value' will be amended so that no particular airline will be referred to for valuation purposes.

The Government committed itself at that time to further consider some issues raised in submissions to the Report, and to further consult with petroleum industry representatives. This consultation has extended to confidential discussion of draft legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this process, it was announced in the Budget that amendments would be made to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax law to help ensure that it does not delay exploration following changes in interests in  projects or otherwise distort commercial decision-making, and to ease compliance by resource rent taxpayers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another amendment will  provide deductions for the capital cost of establishing grape vines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under existing income tax law, winegrowers are able to depreciate certain costs of establishing a vineyard. For instance, plant depreciation deductions are available for the cost of trellising and irrigation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided to allow expenditure incurred on or after 1 July 1993 on establishing grape vines in Australia to be evenly written-off over four years. The deductions will be available from the time the vines are planted. Costs currently eligible for depreciation deductions will continue to be deductible under those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of the amendments is estimated to be $1.5 million in 1994/95, $3 million in 1995/96 and $4.5 million in 1996/97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will provide a significant benefit to grape growers and will facilitate the planting of new vines able to produce higher quality wine.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, a further amendment will make a minor technical change to the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 to clarify the extent to which penalties can apply to acts or omissions that happen after the introduction of amendments of the sales tax law but before they receive Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for the amendment arises from suggestions that taxpayers are under no obligation to pay any sales tax until 28 days after the Government's Budget sales tax Bills receive the Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned that taxpayers might be confused by these suggestions and fail to make payments of tax that are legally due for payment. The sales tax law imposes penalties for late payment of tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will insert a clearer expression of the effect of the existing law, so that taxpayers will be in no doubt that the passage of amending laws will not relieve a person from a continuing liability under the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Press reports which suggested that as much as $1 billion may have been at risk if the Government had not made this amendment were greatly exaggerated. The purported weakness in the law raises only a question of the timing of certain payments, so that the cost to the Government even of the claimed interpretation would have been small.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill was last debated, I had perhaps two minutes of my time left.

I dealt with that fact as well as some of the general attributes of the bill when I last spoke. All I wanted to say now is that successive Australian governments have approached the United  Nations conferences on the law of the sea, which, in fact resulted in this 1982 convention, in a bipartisan spirit, and that is still the case. In fact, subsequent to the 1982 convention being finalised and Australia signing it, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in this chamber in December of that year, responding to a question in the Senate, said that the government had taken the view that the overall benefits of the 1982 convention outweighed its disadvantages and that Australia continued to hope the convention would come to be universally supported and to provide an agreed framework for all aspects of the use of the seas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of course a very important subject for Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), together with the excellent precis of that speech by Senator Vanstone, has, I think, adequately covered what the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill is about. Very briefly, the bill brings Australia into  line with international law enshrined in the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. As Senator Vanstone said, the bill amends a number of other pieces of legislation, specifically the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973. It substitutes the 1958 Territorial Sea and Continental Shelf Conventions with references to the relevant provisions in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It establishes a different definition for the territorial seas, the zone over which Australia exercises jurisdiction, and establishes the rights of Australia over that exclusive economic zone. It adopts a revised definition of the continental shelf and asserts rights over the contiguous zone. It adopts new international legal provisions for the drawing of the territorial sea baselines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I understand that the convention has not yet come into operation, that there are 59 countries which have signed the convention and that the convention requires 60 signatures to come into effect, so one might expect fairly reasonably that in the near future the convention will come into effect when Australia signs the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are several issues in relation to this legislation that I would like to highlight. When we get to the committee stage of the bill, while I will not be  moving amendments, I would like to seek assurances from the minister in relation to several of those matters. One of the matters that I want to raise is in relation to the fact that the processes leading to these international conventions are often very long and drawn out and, by the very nature of that process, some of the wording and concepts tend to become out of date by the time one gets around to legislating for them. That is the case with some of the matters that I want to raise in relation to schedule two of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general issue of the slowness with which international conventions are concluded also relates to the matter of international rights over the deep seabed. I am aware that some years ago when this issue of possibly mining the deep sea arose&mdash;that is, the sea beyond the extent of nations, continental shelves and the 200-mile exclusion zone&mdash;the underdeveloped countries in the world were very concerned that they should have reasonable access to the wealth of the deep seabed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar to some of the thinking that has gone into the control and protection of Antarctica, we are taking the view that the deep oceans are part of the common heritage of all humankind and that the exploitation of manganese and other nodules in the deep seabed should not become the exclusive prerogative of those nations which, simply by reason of their wealth and technology, are capable of exploiting them. I understand that that is still a matter which needs to be properly worked out. Certainly the Australian Democrats would like to see the recognition of common ownership of that deep seabed progressed in the further consideration of this international convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be suggested that the resources in those areas be considered to be resources owned by everyone. It might become a source of income for the United Nations in that it might license companies that are capable of exploiting those resources. The royalties from that might flow to all nations and not simply to those which had the wealth and the technology to exploit them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is wording in the items listed in schedule 2 that is of considerable concern to the Democrats and many people in the conservation movement. I refer particularly to articles 61 to 72. For example, article 61 talks about the states exploiting their exclusive economic zone&mdash;the 200-mile economic exclusion zone&mdash;in the ocean in such a way that it can produce `the maximum sustainable yield'. That terminology was certainly around in fishing circles perhaps 10 or 15 years ago when this convention was first being formulated. But it is certainly a concept which we have now moved beyond in our thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most fisheries experts, environmental people and people who are aware of the natural variability in wild populations recognise that the notion of the maximum sustainable yield is not sustainable; it simply does not fit with the notion of ecological sustainability. It is concerning to see that that sort of terminology is still present in this schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 62 talks about optimum utilisation&mdash;again, demonstrating the notion that this exclusion zone exists for utilisation and exploitation. It then mentions the rights of other states to use some of the surplus, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it shall, through agreements and other arrangements and pursuant to the terms, conditions, laws and regulations referred to in paragraph 4, give other States access to the surplus of the allowable catch . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . having particular regard to the provisions of articles 69 and 70&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which fortunately talk about conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are certainly very concerned that the thinking which lies behind these sections is really anachronistic and out of line with present thinking and that, if implemented, it would not be in line with some of the thinking which is now going into the revision of the fisheries legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke to the minister about these sections, I was assured that they will not override in any way any legislation which Australia might pass in relation to the protection of either fish stocks, the marine environment in general or any other potentially exploitable resource in Australia's zone. I accept the assurance given by the minister, but at the committee stage I will be seeking to get that assurance into the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who is at the table and has carriage of this bill, has on the record what I will be seeking from him, I will read those requests to him. The first is that the government assures the parliament that the passage of the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 will not result&mdash;I stress the words `not result'&mdash;in the application of articles 61 to 73 inclusive to the fisheries management regime in Australia and that fisheries management will continue to be consistent with the approach adopted in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development, namely, that fisheries be managed within an ecosystem management framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I will request that the government state its commitment to reconsidering aspects of the convention relating to the conservation and utilisation of living resources in a range of relevant fora, including the conference on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea upon the coming into effect of the convention, including agenda item 21. Thirdly, I will request that the government call for the convention to be made consistent with the approach adopted in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development, namely, a `fisheries ecosystem management framework which will provide a more holistic and sustainable approach to the management of aquatic resources'. If the minister would like it, I would certainly be quite happy to provide him with a copy of those words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we met with the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and her officers, we were assured that those matters could be assented to by the minister dealing with this legislation. Consequently, although we had originally thought of seeking an amendment to these sections&mdash;I understand that at one stage Senator Chamarette considered totally deleting them&mdash;if we have the specific assurances that they are not applicable to the Australian legislation, that they will not be implemented and that Australian legislation will prevail, we will assent to the bill's passage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 primarily amends the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 to bring it up to date from 1982 with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Its primary purpose is to redefine the economic exclusion zone. This in itself is not a problem for the Greens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes a new inserted schedule to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act which is a reproduction of parts II, V and VI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This does represent a problem. Australia has not ratified the law of the sea convention. Hence, there is no compulsion for Australia to include text from the convention in this piece of legislation. However, most countries, including Australia, would accept that a large part of the United Nations convention&mdash;I will call it UNCLOS for brevity&mdash;is now considered to be customary international law. Article 62 of the UNCLOS, on page 24 of this bill, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coastal State shall promote the objective of optimum utilisation of the living resources in the exclusive economic zone without prejudice to article 61.</PARA>
<PARA>Article 61 refers to the best scientific evidence to ensure conservation and management measures. Article 62(2) says that countries that do not have the capacity to exploit their resources must allow other countries to come in and fish the waters to the optimum utilisation level. As Senator Coulter mentioned when he was discussing maximum sustainable yield, the use of the term `optimum utilisation' is an example of outdated phraseology. In the past it has set the basic framework for the overexploitation of coastal waters around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overexploitation by non-resident countries, because of article 62 of UNCLOS, is a massive problem world-wide. Confrontation between intensive industrial fishing and subsistence coastal fishing affects 6.5 million people in India and 20 to 25 million people in South East Asia. Two-thirds of the fish caught off the west African coast go to Russia, Spain, France, Poland and Japan to make fishmeal for stock or fertiliser for crops. Meanwhile, the population of west Africa suffers a protein deficiency because it does not have the capacity to exploit its own fish resources, nor the political strength&mdash;because of the principles defined in article 62(2)&mdash;to stop overexploitation by other nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A review of the state of the world's fisheries resources published in 1990 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation found that almost every commercial fish species was classified as depleted, fully exploited or over exploited. The Australian Government's national ESD report calls on fisheries management agencies to adopt a fisheries ecosystem management framework. This approach makes the terminology that we are discussing obsolete.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was, as Senator Coulter mentioned, prepared to place some amendments before the committee to delete completely schedule 2 from this bill. However, I support fully his requests for assurances from the minister during the committee stage. I feel that that will be a sufficient assurance and will offset passing an amendment which may gut the bill to quite a considerable degree and which also may have difficulty in passage. I support and agree with the requests made by Senator Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support three requests to the government furnished by Greenpeace. Firstly, we would like the government to give notice that it believes that there are still difficulties with some parts of the UNCLOS and that they should not represent customary international law. This is critical if we are to have a framework for negotiating an ecologically sustainable management regime for our oceans. We should not accept the outdated terminology of this convention as it stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I call for the government to review UNCLOS in relation to the use of marine living resources so that it is consistent with the International Convention on Biological Diversity and with the language found in agenda 21. Thirdly, I call for the establishment of a national marine environment management authority to be responsible for Australia's progress in this regard. This would have similar goals to those of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and it would establish a national zoning plan for Australia's marine environment.This bill is supported, providing those strong cautions are made and providing that the minister is able to provide the assurances that have been requested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have no amendments to the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. As indicated in my brief speech at the second reading stage, I seek from the minister an assurance in relation to three points. Firstly, I ask that the government assure the parliament that the passage of the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 will not result in the application of articles 61 to 73 inclusive to the fisheries management regime in Australia and that fisheries management will continue to be consistent with the approach adopted in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development, namely, that fisheries be managed within an ecosystem management framework.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I ask that the government state its commitment to reconsider aspects of the convention relating to the conservation and utilisation of living resources in a range of relevant fora, including a conference on the convention of the law of the sea, that is, upon the coming into effect of the convention and agenda 21. Thirdly, I ask that the government calls for the convention to be made consistent with the approach adopted in the national strategy for ecologically sustainable development, namely, `a fisheries ecosystem management framework which will provide a more holistic and sustainable approach to management of aquatic resources'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Coulter acknowledged in his address to the Senate at the second reading stage, he has received correspondence from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) on this matter, but he wanted assurances made here in the parliament on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, which is a perfectly reasonable thing to ask for. I can provide Senator Coulter with assurances which I hope will satisfy him and Senator Chamarette.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the additional matters referred to by Senator Chamarette that Greenpeace has raised, as I am not the environment minister, I am unfortunately not in a position to address those matters directly. I am familiar with the Democrats' position because I have read the correspondence and I have seen Minister Kelly's reply to it, but these are new issues on which I am not in a position to give any assurances unilaterally. I can assure Senator Chamarette that I will ensure that the additional matters she has raised which are new to me are drawn to the attention of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter raised the issue of common heritage of the deep seabed. I can provide him with the assurance that he is seeking. I refer him to the language of the convention itself, the relevant section of which states, `the deep seabed is part of the common heritage of all mankind'. That is a fairly categorical assurance on that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government does acknowledge that the law of the sea convention was adopted over 10 years ago. For that reason, some of the terminology used in the convention would have been different if negotiations had been completed this year. For example, the convention does not refer to ecologically sustainable development, which is a term that has arisen in the lexicon only in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government's position is that the provisions of the law of the sea convention are not inconsistent with the principle of ecologically sustainable development. I am happy to assert that the Australian government's position is that not only are those provisions not inconsistent with that principle but also that they are capable of being, and should be, implemented in a manner which is consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing importance of doing that is clearly a view which is shared by the international community. I draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 78 of chapter 17 of agenda 21, which was adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, which was known colloquially as the Earth Summit, in Brazil in 1992, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States should ensure that marine living resources of the exclusive economic zone and other areas under national jurisdiction are conserved and managed in accordance with the provision of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</PARA>
<PARA>Following on from that, agenda 21 calls upon states to `implement strategies for the sustainable use of marine living resources'. Agenda 21 therefore confirms that in the eyes of the international community, despite the slightly anachronistic language, the principles in the relevant articles of the law of the sea convention remain relevant. Agenda 21 is indicative of the international view that the provisions of the convention relating to the utilisation of marine living resources can, and should be, implemented consistently with the principle of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That view on the international plane is also reflected in Australia's legislation. I think Senator Coulter would agree that that is really the important part. The Fisheries Management Act is the primary Australian legislation governing the use of marine living resources. One of the objectives under that act which must be pursued by the minister and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is consistency with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister and the department are also required to have regard to the objectives of proper conservation and management and optimum utilisation which are set out in articles 61 and 62 of the law of the sea convention. The reference in the objectives of the Fisheries Management Act to both ecologically sustainable development and the principles of the law of the sea convention is indicative of the fact that, as far as the Australian government is concerned, there is no inconsistency between those two matters. I assert again for the benefit of the Senate that the Australian government's view is that not only can those principles of ecologically sustainable development be implemented in Australia in our fisheries reserves but that they should be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one matter that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) did not take up, and that is in relation to point 2. I accept his assurance totally in relation to the application or the non-application of these particular words to Australian law. He indicated that Australia's law in relation to the utilisation of marine resources will be Australian and not influenced by this schedule. Point 2 relates to taking up these matters in other international fora so that we get beyond this anachronistic wording and do not talk about maximum sustainable yield and so on in other areas. I would like the assurance of the minister in relation to that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette made the point that around the world living marine resources have been overexploited. She mentioned several instances where First World countries have exploited the fishing resources of Third World countries. This has left many Third World countries with dire protein shortages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not need to go that far. One finds that Australia's fisheries resources have been overexploited. With very few exceptions, those resources have been run down. That is a matter of great concern to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which is currently reviewing the adequacy of the Commonwealth's fisheries legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically we have not managed our fisheries that come under Commonwealth control very well at all. A few of the fisheries under state control have been brought back from the brink. For example, the rock lobster fishery in my state of South Australia was in dire straits several years ago. However, there are some fisheries that are quite well managed. One hopes that the wording used in Australia's legislation will be quite stringently applied because, unless it is, our own fisheries resources are by no means secure. </PARA>

The food and agricultural organisation of the United Nations is developing an international code of conduct on responsible fishing. Australia is an active participant in these processes and will wish to see results that are consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development in the outcome of these further discussions; that is, results that would ensure that the marine living resources aspects of the law of the sea convention are implemented consistently with the principles of ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1993&mdash;a bill which seeks to extend the operations of the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 for a further three years until 28 December 1996. Currently, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has the power to establish quota schemes to control the export of meat and live sheep from Australia. Such quota schemes are necessary when countries impose meat quotas or other restrictions on Australia. For example, over the past three years United States `blackmail' has forced Australia to agree to restrict its exports of meat to the US or risk the imposition of quotas under the US meat import law, commonly known as MIL.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this so-called voluntary restraint agreement, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation has imposed quotas on beef, mutton and goat meat to the United States. The US meat import law, enacted in 1964, contains a formula which determines the permitted level of imports, known as the trigger level, for each calendar year. The formula allows imports to grow in line with the overall increase in beef production. However, import controls are imposed if the US Secretary of Agriculture estimates that imports will reach trigger level. As the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) pointed out in the other place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US prefers to negotiate voluntary restraints with supplier countries rather than impose import quotas.</PARA>
<PARA>If we were not to comply with this voluntary restriction, Australia could lose about 10 per cent, or about $110 million worth, of exports to the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics completed a study for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent times the efficacy of the price stabilisation capacity of the MIL has been eroded by the sharp increase in the (Canada-US Free Trade Agreement); the recent growth in US beef exports, particularly to North Asia; and aspects of the MIL formula itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that our beef trade to the United States is worth over $1.1 billion a year, the federal government hopes to have the meat import law eliminated as part of the Uruguay Round of the GATT trade talks. Such a move could mean good news for meat exporters and producers. It promises greater predicability of market access as well as a boost to investor confidence in the beef industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) from southern Queensland recently noted the value adding efforts of the beef industry. Mr Scott said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The beef industry has largely gone down the line of producing more feedlot beef. That creates a lot more stability in the meat industry, with beef of consistent quality coming onto the market. That is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But all that costs money, and to invest in the beef industry today requires substantial capital. If people are to invest in the meat industry, particularly at any stage of the feedlot industry, they need stability and predicability in the markets. Only then will beef producers get on with the job of expanding our beef exports and our beef industry in Australia. So the GATT talks and the December deadline are extremely important to the meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The United States is Australia's largest beef export market in quantity terms. However, it is worth noting the value of our beef, sheep meat and buffalo exports to the European Community. Although the EC only allows imports of 16,500 tonnes of sheep meat, 6,032 tonnes of beef and 2,250 tonnes of buffalo meat, the market is high priced and earns Australia about $150 million a year. These strict limits mean that the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation must issue quotas. These are issued without charge. The AMLC also has the power to restrict the export of live sheep and it can allocate these quotas free or by auctions, sale by tender or private sale. To date, these powers have not been used. In fact, Australia voluntarily withdrew its exports of live sheep to Saudi Arabia two years ago following a series of rejections, supposedly for quarantine reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 requires details of proposed quota allocation and management schemes to be published in the corporation's corporate plan, which must have ministerial approval, and to be available to all exporters. Also provided is a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this legislation, described by one of my colleagues as `necessary evil', has the support of the federal coalition because it gives the Australian meat and livestock producer the best possible chance of export earnings without jeopardising export markets. Like my colleagues, I trust that Australia's problems with the United States meat import law will be resolved as quickly and as fairly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill 1993 has been fairly described in the other place as a daylight saving bill because, like daylight saving, it extends the sunset of the legislation. The need to extend quotas is a comment on the state of play of free trade. The legislation is needed only because the United States and other countries impose quotas on how much meat we can export. That is always a worry to me as somebody who believes in fair trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has restrained its exports of meat to the US under a virtual blackmail arrangement to prevent the US authorities imposing quotas under the meat import law, the MIL. This arrangement has been in place for three years. This amendment bill will extend the life of the legislation another three years. I am confident that within that time frame a true free or fair trade arrangement can be put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is so much talk about this around the world at the moment. We are talking about the GATT meeting of 15 December; APEC will have meetings in the next few days; and the NAFTA arrangements are going on with the United States, Canada and Mexico. Let us hope that something comes out of all of this, especially the GATT meeting to which I hope people will turn their attention. I am not full of confidence that a time frame in relation to GATT to give fair trade around the world will be put in place on 15 December. I am not as confident as some that there will be a successful outcome, especially in agriculture. We have to think about what the European Community, especially the French and the Germans, and the Americans are still talking about. If there is to be fair trade and we are all going to compete on a fair basis, there will be problems with land values and that sort of thing in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not get a successful conclusion to GATT on 15 December, it will be very regrettable for world agriculture and particularly regrettable for Australia. A recent OECD report suggested that a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round would inject over $400 billion into the world economy. This would be of immense help to getting the whole of the world out of the recession it is in at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is one of numerous measures around the world that countries are forced to take to accommodate trade restrictions and requirements from other countries. Beef exports to the United States are a significant market indicator for domestic prices. The United States is our biggest export market for beef and veal. Over the 1992-94 seasons we will have lost some 19 per cent in exports to the United States, due in large part to access restrictions placed on us by the United States authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that, our total value of meat exports will top $3.42 billion this financial year. That is a wonderful thing. As such, beef is an important export commodity for Australia. As a beef producer&mdash;and my pecuniary interests are well and truly tied to the beef industry&mdash;I would like to think, and I believe it is true, that we produce some of the best meat in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Chee. I know what he does for the beef industry in Queensland and what Senator Panizza does for it in Western Australia. The world has to understand that our beef is produced without subsidy, our production is efficient and the meat we sell is cheap by world standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my colleagues, Senator Calvert, has just come back from France. I asked him whether he had a few good steaks when he was there. He said we do not realise how fortunate we are in Australia with the cost of food until we go to places in the European Community. How those consumers in the European Community can afford to keep on paying the subsidies they pay to their farmers, heaven knows. It is definitely keeping up the cost for consumers and it also puts instability into the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that Australia stands on the sideline and is an innocent victim in the trade wars of countries like the United States, France and other European Community countries, we pay the penalty for their support systems in restricted access for our products. Access is the big thing in the GATT Round, but I believe it has been left too late in the round to make things happen. The internal subsidies and the external support systems might be reduced a bit as far as agriculture is concerned, but I do not know whether we will get the access that we really need. This bill is about access to a market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One industry I would like to make mention of that tends to be overlooked in the wash-out of these quotas is the goat meat industry. I would particularly like to mention the Desert Oak Abattoir at Broken Hill. This company is seeking export markets for its goat meat, which it gets from feral goatherds throughout New South Wales and elsewhere. If nothing else, this company is doing a jolly good service ridding Australia of one of our feral pests. However, in order to obtain access for its product into the United States, it has to buy a quota, and that quota must come from the beef industry quota. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that is put up to me in a lot of saleyards that I go to around New South Wales and other states is the problem of people trying to get into a quota which is given to companies which might never do much towards producing beef&mdash;they are really just agents or traders within the meat industry. The AMLC should look at whether people who cannot fill the quotas in the meat industries in Australia should be able to transfer them without cost to people who can. I have had talks with the AMLC about this and I have been given good reasons why it should not happen; but maybe it is something that should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to goat meat, prices for the quotas for the goat meat people to buy start at about 45c a pound. I have heard that people who hold quotas which they cannot fill sell them at $1 a pound. Clearly, this is outside the capacity of the goat meat industry, and at that price it is pointless the industry even trying to source the market. The argument that this industry has raised with me and my colleagues, Bruce Scott and Michael Cobb from the other place, is that there ought to be separate access for goat meat because it is a different product. If it is wanted, surely we should be able to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If markets could be established for goat meat, the industry would expand and it would add to and strengthen our export commodity mix. As I have said, it would also protect our environment and save Australian taxpayers a great deal of money in environmental restoration works. However, there seems to be little support for the goat meat industry's arguments. Given our restricted access with beef, it is understandable that any beef quota would not be given away without a cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other quotas controlled by the AMLC are those for live sheep exports. In the past the live sheep industry has been an enormous boost for the Australian sheep industry, albeit that we have lost some of those Middle East markets to the New Zealanders. That is something else we should look at, especially in the beef industry. Only this morning we heard evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs that the New Zealanders with their meat inspection services and the efficiency of their abattoirs can really outstrip us in getting that product offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only need to look at the last election and the promises by this government not to put up costs. We have just had another cost added to the beef industry with the fuel excise increase, which has put up the price of our transport to the abattoirs and from the abattoirs to the waterfront. Of course, we still have not reformed the waterfront properly. With all the international factors concerning attitudes to supplying markets, we have to look at our figures and our cost of production here at home to make sure that we can compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the wool industry has come to realise that its industry is not immune to the vagaries of the marketplace and that more serious attention in future will have to be paid to servicing the live sheep trade. As I have said, that is an area that we have lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I started off by saying, basically this bill is just putting restrictions on us as Australian exporters to make sure that we do not invoke any problems for the United States meat import laws. The legislation will go on for another three years. As Senator Tambling has already said, we support this bill. I hope that, before we debate it again in three years' time, full and fair trade has been instituted around the world that will give everyone a much better standard of living because of a fair trade situation. </PARA>

Presently, quotas exist for beef, mutton and goat meat into the US and beef, sheep meat and buffalo meat into the European Community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great disappointment to our trading relationship with the US that every year for the last three years, the US has used its protectionist meat import law to limit Australian beef into the US. These US laws reduced US exports last year by up to 20 per cent. It is hoped that with any resolution of the GATT Uruguay Round, this protectionist measure by the US government will be removed quickly. We live in hope rather than expectation. Under the present US meat import law, Australian exporters are left with no option but to accept voluntary restraint agreements on their exports into the US. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also disappointing this year to see Canada impose a 25 per cent tariff on Australian beef. The Australian beef industry is in a healthy state, despite the widespread drought devastating much of Queensland. Our national herd stands at 25 million. More beef is now produced from our present herd than 10 years ago when there were 10 million more head of cattle. Two-thirds of our slaughter of 1.8 million tonnes are exported, with a record 65 per cent of the nation's beef production exported last year. Export earnings at nearly $3 billion are up 60 per cent on four years ago. The efficiency of the beef industry has never been better which augurs well for investment in meat processing. I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) is in the chamber because what I am going to say will have grave ramifications on the meat industry. </PARA>

Australian Meat Holdings, AMH, is by far the largest Australian processor with 13 per cent of the cattle kill, 30 per cent of Queensland's cattle processing capacity and 23 per cent of national beef exports. It also operates four feedlots which comprise 25 per cent of total Australian feedlot capacity. The Smorgon Meat Group, which recently acquired the works of Angliss Holdings, is the next largest, now having six per cent of the Australian cattle kill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Around 20 major Australian abattoirs have foreign equity investment; they are all export abattoirs and account for 50 percent of exports going mainly to the largest export destination, North Asia.

It is acknowledged that Australian farmers, to increase returns, must control their products beyond the farm gate&mdash;another axiom that Senator Sherry and the minister, Mr Crean, have been pushing all over rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A perfect example of this process is with beef processing. One major effort to meet this challenge for Australian farmers is with the farmers investment trust, which has just been launched. Its purpose is to provide an opportunity for farmers to invest in the processing, marketing and distribution of their product, both domestically and internationally, and to achieve commercial returns for these investments. The aim of the investment trust is to eventually establish a balance of investments across the spectrum of food and fibre industries. Up to 35 million units at $1 each have been offered, and oversubscription will be accepted. The trust has an allocation to subscribe for up to 30 per cent of the issued shares in Elders Australia, requiring $29,610,000, with any excess available for investment in other authorised investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trust has the stated objective of giving farmers greater influence over downstream processing, marketing and distribution of farm produce and to provide farmers with better information to enable them to improve their product and be more responsive to changing market requirements. However, the trust will not be in a position to involve itself in a possible bid for the Fosters stake in AMH until March. It is bad timing for the trust but good timing for Fosters which has offered its major partner in AMH, the US multinational ConAgra, its 45 per cent shareholding; that will take it up to 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to ask the minister, through Senator Sherry, his representative here, to delay the foreign investment board approval by just a few months to allow an Australian contender a chance to buy into AMH. There are real feelings of deja vu when we look at the issue of AMH and the chance for Australians to buy into the important export meat processing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1988 the Elders meat subsidiary, Australian Meat Holdings, took over Thomas Borthwick. This resulted in AMH controlling 86.5 per cent of the slaughtering capacity in north Queensland and 51 per cent in central Queensland. When challenged, the Federal Full Court held that the acquisition would put AMH in a position to dominate the north Queensland fat cattle market and found a breach of section 50 of the Trade Practices Act. The court ordered a divesting of four smaller Borthwick abattoirs but, in effect, some were closed and Elders bought out the other consortium members of AMH and ended up controlling six per cent of the eight export abattoirs in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in 1990 Elders sold 50 per cent of AMH to the multinational, ConAgra. At that time a consortium of well established and distinguished cattle producers made a valiant effort to buy the Elders share offered to ConAgra. That consortium met all sorts of resistance and an opportunity to have increased Australian ownership was foiled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be acknowledged by all interested in the beef industry that since then ConAgra has done much to advance the company to its present healthy state. As ConAgra has said, it has invested in the company tens of millions of dollars in capital expenditure. The annual export sales of AMH have increased by $225 million since May 1991, and employee numbers have increased from 3,800 to 4,600. But this is all in the context of a burgeoning beef market and also a period when producers' returns have not been the beneficiaries of increased industry earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland beef industry has a large proportion of foreign ownership. Foreign ownership of the cattle slaughter amounts to 81 per cent in north Queensland, 85 per cent in central Queensland, 38 per cent in south Queensland making 53 per cent in all Queensland. Although the industry welcomes the benefits that arise from foreign investment, foreign ownership can be an agent capable of not always putting first the good of the Australian industry. The Queensland beef industry exports 80 per cent of its output and Australia 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Japanese and Korean markets&mdash;the destination for 27 per cent of our exports&mdash;the US is our main competitor. In the US market, Australia is in direct competition with the US producers. According to ABARE, in 1970 Australia had 79 per cent of beef imports into Japan and the US had six per cent; by 1986 Australia had 32 per cent and the US 61 per cent&mdash;a complete reversal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem from the competitive angle arises where foreign ownership is vertically integrated, as occurs in Queensland. The highly productive value adding operations take place overseas. For example, 95 per cent of our US exports is the lower priced manufacturing beef which is then mixed with the higher value US beef and sold into the hamburger market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international beef market is sophisticated and complex. With entitlements in the Australian market, it is possible to buy a large share of entitlements at a high price and then force the local price down to take advantage of shortages in the international market. We have companies like ConAgra, which have large involvements in the Canadian market, that can purchase Australian entitlements and control Australian prices into the Canadian market, over which they also exert some form of influence and control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other consequences are the possibilities for transfer pricing, loss of our industry's acknowledged superior technological advantage to our competitors which has been heavily funded by the industry and the loss of product quality with the processor concerned more with price than with quality. There are also the consequences from one company having so much control that returns to beef producers fall through the emergence of buying rings established at cattle sales and auctions aimed at obtaining cheaper raw product for the company to process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the battle has been lost for more competition in the processing side, the Australian industry could benefit from more Australian involvement in the processing industry, such as the 45 per cent share of AMH being retained by Australian interests. When ConAgra made its 50 per cent purchase in AMH the joint venture comprised 50 per cent ownership by Australian companies&mdash;45 per cent by Elders and five per cent by the D.R. Johnston group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time Elders said that it expected to sell a further 25 per cent of the meat business to Australian investors and to retain 25 per cent as a long-term investment under the Elders pastoral banner. But now, Fosters, the successors to Elders' meat involvement, seems to have forgotten its concern and promises given in 1990, that the 45 per cent share remain with Australian interests. It is a shame that Fosters has not followed through with its 1990 commitment to the Australian interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meat processing is dominated by small numbers of processors and large numbers of producers. It is an industry that has a large capital start-up requirement and is heavily regulated, which discourages new entrants. According to ABARE, it also has the smallest profit margins of any food processing&mdash;being half of beverages processors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future for the Australian industry lies in value adding and increased exports. However, the concentration and size of companies controlling a major proportion of the market discourages the significant entry of Australian interests into the much needed value adding downstream activities, such as packaging, distribution and retailing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a beef industry on the verge of increasing its sales. There is the liberalisation of trade to Japan, good sales prospects into Korea, anticipated increased entry into the EC and trade liberalisation should the GATT Uruguay Round be successful. The AMLRDC and the AMLC 1990-91 reports estimate a potential increase in the market of $200 million by 1994. These are the rosy future prospects for the Australian industry which Australian producers through investment in their own Australian industry should be encouraged to be involved in. It should also be in the government's interest that the long-term future for Australian farmers is assured and solidly based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farmers investment trust, or any other domestic interest for that matter, should not be prevented from the opportunity to invest in AMH. To this end, I call on the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) not to make the Australian primary industry a victim of timing. Unfortunately, the investment trust is not yet up and running strongly enough to make a bid, yet by March next year it will be ready. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the passage of the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Amendment Bill but, at the same time, I call on the Treasurer and the government to delay the FIRB decision on the sale of Fosters shareholding in AMH to ConAgra by a few months. A small delay would allow the Australian industry a chance for involvement in the vital next value adding step. It would allow Australian producers control over their industry beyond the farm gate&mdash;a process which has been strongly recommended and promoted by the government, its advisers and the industry itself. </PARA>

<PARA>Justin O'Byrne was born on 1 June 1912 in Launceston, Tasmania, and was educated at St Patrick's College. He lived a full life. At the age of 18 he left home and ventured north to Queensland in search of work. He did a number of things, including droving, fencing and bullock driving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1940 he enlisted in the RAAF, becoming a member of the First Australian Fighter Squadron. He flew patrols over the English Channel and the North Sea and took part in operations over France. It was on one of those operations over France in 1941 that his aircraft was shot down and he was captured by the occupying German forces. Justin ended up in the infamous Stalag Luft III prison camp. The courage and tenacity of the men there was made known to the world after the war through such movies as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wooden Horse</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Great Escape</EMPHASIS>. He spent three years and nine months as a prisoner of war and returned home in 1945 having attained the rank of flight lieutenant. Justin was a great storyteller and would tell of the years spent plotting escapes from the prison and holding political discussions to alleviate the boredom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aircraft that Justin flew during the war, a Spitfire, has been on display in the Australian War Memorial since 1956. The plaque bears Justin's name and the names of two of his comrades. This stands as just one of the permanent reminders of the participation of Australian pilots in the war and the contributions they made for their country in lands far from their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1956 he stood for and won a seat in this chamber representing his home state of Tasmania, beginning a political career that was to last through 34 years, nine governors-general and eight prime ministers&mdash;not a bad record. At the time of his election he was the youngest senator in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin served on numerous committees, including the standing orders committee, the public works committee and the committee on the new and permanent Parliament House, just to name a few. He also served as temporary chairman of committees from 1949 to 1961. He spent 10 years as the opposition whip and then a short period as government whip before his election in 1974 to the office of President of the Senate, the official title that went with his unofficial title of father of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin presided over the Senate during one of the most tumultuous and still controversial periods in Australian politics. The fact that there was not one dissent from his rulings, nor any vote of no confidence, is a testament to his performance and the high regard in which he was held by those on both sides of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A self-described inveterate interjector, he said he often had to bite his tongue while sitting in the chair. As those who knew him would realise, this must have taken a great deal of self-control. He managed to maintain the dignity of his position at all times. As a senator he was vigorous in debate, and his quick wit and humorous antics brought relief to the sometimes dull proceedings in the Senate, but it also got him suspended on one occasion. He was invariably good for a laugh or a joke or a good story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout his career in this place he advocated equality and social justice for all Australians. In his maiden speech he said:</PARA>

<PARA>Justin did not lose sight of his vision for Australia and fought hard to make it a reality. He spent almost his entire life in the service of the Australian people. He was a remarkable man of courage, determination and goodwill. In 1984 he was awarded an Order of Australia in recognition of his service in politics and government. Justin O'Byrne was an Australian of whom we can all be proud. He will be sadly missed. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Anne, and family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that I did not know the late former Senator Justin O'Byrne. It is interesting that the year I was born was the year he came into the Senate and that he left the Senate at the time that I came into the Senate. I notice that when he came into the Senate he was the youngest senator and when I came into the Senate I was certainly the youngest senator on our side. I also notice that we both served as parliamentary advisers to the United Nations at one stage of our respective senatorial careers. So we have some things in common. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was said by Senator Ray, Justin O'Byrne was born in Tasmania in 1912 and educated in Launceston. He clearly had a much harder life in his early years than I did&mdash;leaving Tasmania, as was said, when he was just 18 years of age, during the Great Depression; working through Queensland bullock driving and fencing for some 10 years; and then serving his nation by joining the RAAF as a pilot in 1940. He obviously showed great courage in that period. He was an original member of 452 Fighter Squadron and, as was also said, he was shot down over France in 1941. He spent the next 3 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Germany and eventually returned to Australia in 1945. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following year he was elected as a Labor senator for Tasmania. He remained in the Senate for 34 years, until his retirement in 1981&mdash;the second longest continuous incumbency, I understand, in the Senate's history. As he noted in his final speech, he had spent half his lifetime in the Senate&mdash;a terrifying thought! Obviously, in such a long career in the Senate, there was ample opportunity for committee service. His contribution, I am advised, was outstanding. It included many years on the Senate Standing Committee on Standing Orders and nearly 12 years on the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to committee service, Justin O'Byrne was opposition whip in the Senate from 1962 to 1972 and government whip for the next two years. No doubt the highlight of his parliamentary career, however, came with his election to the high office of President of the Senate in 1974&mdash;a position he held for two years during some of the most turbulent times this chamber has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ray said, during all Justin O'Byrne's years in the parliament he was noted for his concern for the welfare of ordinary Australians&mdash;what we now often refer to as social justice&mdash;and also for his sense of humour. I am advised that his capacity to liven a party or even a dull debate by breaking into verse was legendary. He retired from the Senate, as I said, in 1981 after a long and distinguished career which was recognised by the award of the Order of Australia in 1984. On behalf of opposition senators, I extend our sincere condolences to his widow, Anne, and his children. </PARA>

I thought it was a very fitting reminder to so many people that, in this game of politics, you know who your real friends are. I saw many of Justin's friends there today. We all know who is close and who is not. I thought it was very moving that so many of his real friends were there. Most of them, of course, are at his age and stage of life and it is no longer easy for them to move about at the drop of a hat to be in various places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like everyone else who was associated with him, I think we have to remember the stories he told. We have to remember the way that Thursday nights in the old Parliament House were singsong nights. We need to remember that in this game of politics, you are worth what your principles will carry you through to. Whether we agree with one another's principles or not is immaterial, compared with whether we adhere to them. I would certainly say that Justin always adhered to the principles that he believed he was part of. I always admired him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My next greatest memory of Justin is during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The members of the O'Byrne family were substantially older than I am but certainly, wherever there was a party on, there were a few O'Byrnes. They were always great starters at a good party. The people of Launceston of my age will certainly remember the way the O'Byrne family were always there, always participating and always the life and soul of the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Through those years we regarded Justin as being the typical bachelor, but sooner or later it caught up with him. In Anne I would have to say that he married a great partner, one who participated fully in the life that Justin had set for himself. I extend my very sincere condolences to Anne and the family in the knowledge that the people of Launceston in particular, and the people of Tasmania in general, feel for them very much at this time. I appreciate the opportunity that I had to attend the funeral and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to be associated with the condolence motion which is before the chamber due to the passing of our former colleague, the Hon. Justin O'Byrne. I join with other senators who have spoken in extending my sincere condolences to Justin's family and close friends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some senators will have known Justin longer than I did, especially those from Justin's home state of Tasmania. My association with Justin, however, began after my election to the Senate in 1975. I recall that when I was waiting at a motel for transport to take me to Parliament House for my first day of sitting, a young lady who was staying at the same place remarked to me that it would be a sad day. Actually, I thought it was anything but a sad occasion because I had first stood for the Senate in 1970, then again in 1974 and, having been passed over by the Queensland Parliament for a casual vacancy in August and September 1975, I was beginning to wonder whether I should have opted for an academic career instead. So I was compelled to ask why the day would not be memorable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young lady replied that the senator for whom she worked&mdash;she referred to him as her boss&mdash;was about to lose his job. She was, of course, referring to Justin and his position as President of the Senate. Later in the day, when Condor Laucke assumed the presidency of the Senate, Justin handled the situation with consummate grace and his congratulations to the new president were absolutely sincere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Over the years which followed our first meeting, a firm friendship developed between Justin and me, even though I was about 26 years his junior and he had already seen 28 years of service in the Senate before I entered the parliament. There are probably  countless warm stories which can be told about Justin, because he was such a fine raconteur, especially at the dinner table in the old Parliament House. Quite a few times I heard the story of how he was compelled to bail out over enemy held territory. His hands had been scalded by escaping engine oil and, if I remember correctly, because of damage to his aircraft, he had to turn it upside down to bail out. I used to be fascinated at how he described his surprise at how small his parachute appeared to be when he looked up. He also mentioned that after he bailed out he could see the white cliffs of Dover to the west but described how they disappeared from his view as he descended. I expect that he had wistful memories of those white cliffs during his three and a half years as a prisoner of war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot recall Justin speaking about his early years in the Senate when Ben Chifley was in office as Prime Minister. To me, contemporary memories of the Chifley government were associated with an era when I wore short pants to school. But in our midst here was a person who was actually serving in parliament before Labor's loss of government in 1949. With Justin's passing, very few members of that era still remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A cursory glance at the 1982 parliamentary handbook, the handbook in which Justin last appeared as a sitting senator, indicates the breadth of his parliamentary service, especially when one considers that the greater part of his 34 years as a senator were spent on the opposition benches. In 1972, however, he was again part of the governing party and his long and meritorious service was rewarded by his election to the presidency of the Senate in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Justin retired from the Senate in 1981, it was not uncommon for him to return to Canberra. Whenever he did, it was ever so pleasing to meet him once again. On one occasion, when I was chairing a Senate select committee in Launceston, I was surprised and delighted to see Justin&mdash;he was by then retired&mdash;sitting with those who had come to give evidence or listen to the comments of their fellow residents. It is the only time in my experience as a member of any committee that a former president was present at a public hearing. I would have thought that, after 34 years in the Senate, any activity would be preferable to spending a morning at a Senate committee hearing. But it was a measure of Justin's commitment to his local community that he came along to hear what was being said about agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was, quite naturally, saddened when I heard of Justin's death. But I had another regret in that I did not call on him when I was in Launceston in June this year. I considered doing so, but decided against it, thinking I should not invade the privacy of his home. We all pass on eventually, but it never occurred to me that I would not see Justin again. I believe that I had an unreal and unconscious perception that Justin O'Byrne and death were incompatible. Sadly, because I saw and spoke to Justin earlier this year, it did not mean that there would be further opportunities to renew our friendship some time later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is never easy for a family when it loses a loved one. However, I trust that Justin's good wife, Anne, and her family are to some extent comforted in their grief knowing that fond memories of Justin will dwell in the hearts of many people throughout Australia. Those memories will certainly remain with me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my colleagues in offering condolences on the death of fellow Tasmanian, former Senator Justin O'Byrne. Although coming from opposite sides of the political fence, I must say that I felt honoured to have served with him in this chamber during the last three to four years of his very highly distinguished career of 34 years representing the state of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, Justin entered this chamber in 1946. He was the second longest serving member in the history of the Senate. For the last five years of his career, he was regarded as the father of both this chamber and the other place. His service to this chamber was recognised in 1984 when he was made an officer of the Order of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was it that enabled Justin to be elected and re-elected for all those years? As a fellow Launcestonian and close neighbour I knew him and I can honestly say that, throughout his life, Justin had the characteristic of being able to attract and make friends with everybody he met, even those with whom he disagreed. He was a likeable fellow with a ready wit and sociable nature yet, at the same time, he had a keen sense of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember well Justin's farewell that was held at the local civic centre in Launceston&mdash;the well-known Albert Hall&mdash;where over 1,000 people, including the former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, turned out to farewell his distinguished career. I was the only Liberal politician to be invited to that occasion, and I considered it an honour. Justin displayed the familiar charisma on this occasion, yet, at the same time, that streak of larrikinism that made him so popular with the electorate was ever present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday, the obituaries in the local newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Examiner</EMPHASIS>, restated this feeling with the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A laugh, a chat, a joke or two, that's how we will remember you.</PARA>
<PARA>These words are a good example of how so many people summed up Justin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in Justin's recorded comments on leaving the Senate he bemoaned the fact that parliamentarians in the 1980s were no longer `earthy people' and that at times parliament lacked humour and repartee, very necessary ingredients for breaking tension. But he practised this philosophy and, as a consequence, became a man of the people. He understood the philosophy and thoughts of the everyday person. His upbringing and training, his work before the 1930s and his wartime experiences prepared him for the role of being a friend of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin was the seventh child of 10 children. Any person coming from such a background has an intense familiarisation with the problems that a family has to face, particularly at that time. On the other hand, his strong religious training at the local Catholic St Patrick's College gave him a sense of justice for all. In fact, Justin and I shared a common employer but at different times and stages of our career at the well-known Kelsall and Kemp textile plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during the depression years that Justin was forced to leave Tasmania and go droving, bullocking and fencing in Queensland. It was there that he joined the Australian Workers Union and thus had his Labor philosophies extended. A boyhood ambition was also realised at this time when he learned to fly under the empire training scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the announcement of war in 1939, Justin put his flying skills to use and became an Australian fighter squadron member. He was shot down during the aerial battles over France in 1941, spending three years and nine months in German prison camps, including the notorious Stalag Luft III camp, especially built to house captured allied pilots. Here he participated in a number of tunnel escapes for airmen. The famous wartime story, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wooden Horse</EMPHASIS>, was based on exploits in which he was involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that it was during these years in the German concentration camps that he had time to talk with his fellow prisoners and the desire for a political life was created. Thus, in 1946, on his return from the war, Justin was elected to the Senate. At that point, he was the youngest member ever elected to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reading his first speech, the sense of justice and the desire to serve his fellow man shone through. Of interest are his comments in a speech on the estimates and budget delivered on 16 October 1947 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only when we have courage, foresight, and a cause that is just, can we successfully embark on a policy that will assure to all decent people who work with their hands and brains at least the means of earning a livelihood and having sufficient food, clothing and shelter&mdash;a right which every citizen of a country such as this should inherit.</PARA>
<PARA>His wartime experience contributed to the fashioning of his political philosophies. In the same speech, he stated that among:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the valuable lessons learned during the war, we realised that when man-power and machinery are concentrated on the achievement of great production that effort inevitably results in production of abundance. As a nation and as a member of the commonwealth of nations, we should apply that lesson now in times of peace; if we do not, we shall be the losers.</PARA>
<PARA>He hoped that serving in the Senate would be a way in which he could carry forward his hopes, ideas and aspirations for a better world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that Justin always made very positive comments, even about Liberal prime ministers. This says a lot about the character of the man that we are discussing in this condolence motion today. For example, he described Menzies as being outstanding, capable and articulate while Gordon had a `lot of innate ability'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highlight of Justin's long career, as mentioned by many other speakers here today, was his election to the high office of the President of the Senate in 1974. It is fitting that flags were flown at half mast over this building today. The election was unexpected as, when nominated, he did not have a majority of the votes to obtain the position. At the time, Senator Steele made the voting even, but a defection by one of the opposition senators gave it to him. This is again testimony to the fact that he was so well liked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newspaper reports at the time again homed in on this third generation Irish Australian and his ability to inject humour into all situations. The reports comment on his ability to liven up a dull Senate debate with light-hearted doggerels. Many felt that his presidency might be flippant and in stark contrast to the dignified and stately Sir Magnus Cormack. However, the newspapers were wrong. Justin O'Byrne conducted his presidency with dignity. Although the Labor Party was in the minority while he was in the president's chair, there was not one dissent from his rulings or a vote of no confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever side of the political fence Tasmanian politicians have been on, I think they have been able to contribute more than their fair share to the party organisation. Justin O'Byrne was a man first and a politician second. His cheerfulness, ready wit, positive outlook on life and regard for the everyday man will be sorely missed by both his family and friends. To his wife, Anne, always his right hand for most of his political career, his son Justin and his daughters Hilary and Helene, I extend for a second time my deepest sympathy. </PARA>

Many of the people who have come here have been known better by others&mdash;they have been closer to them and have worked with them&mdash;and I sometimes feel that it is a bit gratuitous to add one's comments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It struck me at the time&mdash;in retrospect, it strikes me even more strongly&mdash;that when I first met Justin O'Byrne he had already been in the Senate for 27 years, which seems in itself to be a terrible thought. I have been here for five. The thought that one might serve here for 27 years is beyond comprehension. But he then was nowhere near the end of his effective contribution as a senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justin was on the national executive of the party. He had been in the Senate for 27 years and I was 25 years of age, so it was all a bit hard for me to come to grips with&mdash;this man, who did not seem old enough to have been in the Senate for 27 years, who had that impish humour about which so many people have spoken and who made sensible, worthwhile contributions to the debates, on that senior body of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I knew Justin for 20 years after that. In a sense, my initial impressions were confirmed and reinforced continuously over 20 years of association. He was a man of great integrity. Others have spoken about that; I merely support it. He was a man of great humour; others have spoken about that. I suppose all those who knew him were once or twice the butt of that humour&mdash;not that he was a person who embarrassed others with his humour. He did sometimes tell a joke at our expense, but never with that sharp edge with which people sometimes misuse their humour. He sang the words of some songs that nobody but Justin had ever heard before; he always sang them in a very entertaining way, often with a bit of a message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also was a person of great commitment. I was always impressed by the fact that in his contributions there was always a core of the principle which underpinned the position that he was articulating. He tried to progress from that principle to the conclusion. I do not want to pretend that I always agreed with Justin O'Byrne. He would be stunned; if at any time when I had known him I got up and pretended that, he would have been the first to ridicule such a suggestion. We had some wonderful arguments, but I always respected the fact that he articulated his case from a position of principle, even when they were principles with which I did not agree. He always had the capacity to smile and to share a pleasant conversation after the disagreement. Sometimes they were pretty vigorously argued, particularly if you were able to do it behind closed doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a person who cared and who sought through his life to make a contribution to his country, to his state and for his family.

I always thought that he had a degree of detached objectivity about his approach to politics.

He said, `I've counted it twice and I've got two different results so I think I'll take the ballot papers home tonight and count them properly'.

The bill before us will extend the sunset clause contained in section 9 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 for a further three years; that is, until 28 December 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMLC establishes quotas on the export of goods where restrictions are imposed, or are likely to be imposed, by an importing country or by Australia or, in the case of the export of live sheep or lambs, where the AMLC believes it is in the best interests of the industry to operate such quotas. At present, restrictions are being imposed on our exports of beef, mutton and goat meat to the United States and on the import of Australian beef, buffalo and sheep meat by the EC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats acknowledge these restrictions and recognise the vitally important role the operation of a quota scheme plays in ensuring our reluctant conformity to these restrictions. With over $1 billion worth of beef exported to the US each year and the threat of an import quota being imposed on us under the US meat import law&mdash;a quota which could cost our beef exporters around $100 million&mdash;the importance of upholding our undertakings under voluntary restraint agreements is obvious. The Australian Democrats recognise the important role quotas play, and we will be supporting the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise a couple of issues. Firstly, I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Boswell in his appeal to the government to allow time for the farmers investment trust to secure funds to enable it to purchase Elders shares in AMH. The Democrats have argued for, fought for and made the same appeal on many occasions for ownership of primary industry and other industries to be retained in Australian hands. We have made our regrets about the weakness of the Foreign Investment Review Board known on many occasions. It is our policy to support Australian ownership. So I support the appeal which Senator Boswell has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is also very important for the Democrats. One of the powers contained in the Australian Meat and Live-stock Act, which I would like to spend a little time on, is the power of the AMLC to regulate the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia, if and when it is to recommence and if such regulation is required. Australia's live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia was suspended in 1991 to protect our industry's reputation and to uphold the government's animal welfare obligations. The Democrats welcomed the decision at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy position of the Democrats regarding the export of live sheep is well known to everyone in this chamber. We believe that such trade on the whole is inhuman. That is a strange word to use in relation to sheep, but I think honourable senators know what I mean. It shows a blatant disregard for the welfare of the animals involved. Some honourable senators may respond by arguing that the welfare of the sheep has to be protected for them to be saleable at their destination. Taking this view though sees the animal's welfare from a commercial perspective only and is certainly not the approach the Democrats would want to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific issue I want to pick up is whether or not we need to be exporting as many live sheep as we are currently. The Democrats believe that the live sheep export trade is not only inhuman but we also question the economic value of the trade. In saying that, I acknowledge that often large numbers of live sheep are required by middle eastern countries for various Muslim festivals and that on these occasions we are able to charge a premium price for our sheep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Democrats take the view&mdash;and I notice that this line was also run by the Labor member for Paterson (Mr Horne) in the other place&mdash;that we should be exploring the possibility of negotiating arrangements with the countries to which we presently export live sheep so that the slaughter of those sheep is undertaken in Australia in accordance with Muslim requirements. I understand that on some occasions this occurs in Australia through a process known as hal-al slaughtering. The slaughter is conducted under the supervision or the approval of a Muslim official, and there are quite a number of abattoirs in Australia currently certified by AQIS to conduct such slaughtering. Clearly, if an animal is to be slaughtered, then from an animal welfare perspective it is far more desirable to have that done in Australia as it avoids subjecting the animals to the lengthy and arduous trip to Saudi Arabia. The benefits of slaughtering the animals in Australia are obvious often in terms of the enormous boost it would also provide to our domestic meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our live sheep exports in the year ending June 1993 to countries such as Kuwait, Oman, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, were worth about $119 million. Despite the suspension of our trade with Saudi Arabia we are still exporting over five million live sheep per year. If the trade were to recommence with Saudi Arabia we could expect this figure to increase to somewhere over six million sheep a year being exported from this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that if we could encourage the development of a system whereby at least some of these sheep are slaughtered in Australia and carcasses exported, the benefits economically and in terms of jobs, particularly if our trade was to resume to Saudi Arabia, could be enormous. I urge the government and the AMLC to explore this further with the industry and with the nations involved in the live sheep trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the opposition and the Australian Democrats for their support of this legislation. I want to touch on only three matters very briefly in response to the speakers. Firstly, I will speak about the live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia and the particular problems we have had with the cessation of that trade over the last year or 18 months. There was some criticism earlier in the debate that we should be doing more to bring about the resumption of that trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government has been having close consultations with the live sheep industry and is actively trying to bring about the resumption of the live sheep trade with Saudi Arabia on a satisfactory basis. It should be noted that the live sheep exports to the Middle East region in fact increased over the last year since the cessation of the trade with Saudi Arabia. In 1990-91 some 2.87 million head of sheep, valued at $43.7 million, were exported. In 1991-92 that number increased to just over four million head, valued at $78.9 million&mdash;a 40 per cent increase in numbers and an 80 per cent increase in value. The government is very much aware of the importance of the live sheep trade to Australian producers and is continuing to concentrate its efforts on the development and expansion of this trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area of criticism from the opposition, which we hear fairly regularly and somewhat monotonously at times, relates to the alleged slow pace of waterfront reform. I do not want to go into the very detailed nature of the restructuring that has taken place on the waterfront, except to say that it has been very substantial. The number of people employed on the waterfront has dropped very considerably over the last decade and the government is continuing on the essential micro- and macro-economic reforms in the transport sector. Whilst in some areas the immediate cost reductions have not been evident, we have to remember that the cost of the changes to the waterfront is being amortised over a number of years and that the cost savings will become more and more apparent over the next year or two as that amortisation of the cost of restructuring is brought to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer briefly to the third matter that was raised. Senator Boswell quite rightly raised the critical issue of value adding. He referred to the fairly poor&mdash;not poor in the sense of making a criticism, but poor in the sense of the Australian effort&mdash;direct involvement of our primary producers in value adding, particularly in the export market. We have not had great success in this area. This has been a very strong theme of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean. I know that changes are occurring in the value adding area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my capacity as chair of the citrus working group and the horticultural task force, it is a little sad to reflect that of the 100 major primary industry exporting companies in the world, not one is Australian. One of the critical problems that the National Farmers Federation has identified is the need for farmers to be more directly involved in that export sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell raised the issue of the Foreign Investment Review Board and the possible purchase by ConAgra of AMH and the 45 per cent stake-holding that Fosters currently wishes to sell. I certainly share Senator Boswell's concern for increased value adding and the need to give our primary producers the opportunity to be more directly involved in this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only yesterday I was talking to citrus growers in Griffith about the citrus working group's report on restructuring the industry. I also talked about the Sunkist organisation in the United States. Sunkist is a citrus export company which is owned by growers. Down the production scale, that export company commissions packing houses and growers to pack for it, to grow for it and then it exports on behalf of the growers, returning a dividend to the growers. It is a very successful organisation and it is certainly the type of organisation we hope to see develop more in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the government, I certainly cannot give any indications or commitments about the direction of the Foreign Investment Review Board's decisions in respect of the possible takeover by ConAgra and the extension of its already significant involvement in the rural sector. I have obtained a copy of Senator Boswell's speech. I will be speaking to my minister, Simon Crean, and George Gear, the Assistant Treasurer, who I understand is responsible for this area, about the necessity to improve on the current value adding, particularly by Australian companies and Australian primary producers where that is possible. I will certainly be taking that issue up with the appropriate ministers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we have before us for debate a package of seven bills to give effect to the prudential arrangements for superannuation announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on 21 October 1992 in his statement entitled `Strengthening super security&mdash;new prudential arrangements for superannuation'. These bills and, in particular, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill, are some of the most significant legislation to come before the parliament in the life of this government. They represent the most detailed and far-reaching attempt in the history of superannuation in Australia to impose a common regulatory framework in the superannuation industry. They reflect the constructive approach of the committee system in the Senate where bipartisanship and teamwork have been above politics in determining a system of laws and rules for the good administrative practice in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures will affect almost every superannuation fund in Australia, including approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. Superannuation funds take a number of forms, with the main categories being personal superannuation funds, industry based funds, individual enterprise schemes and government funded schemes. The need for increased supervision of the industry is highlighted by the volume of money under the control of the superannuation funds, the diverse range of funds operating, the Maxwell case in the UK and the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, which has removed the voluntary nature of superannuation funds for most employees. These issues underline the need for increased supervision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government forces employers to contribute to superannuation on behalf of their employees&mdash;and often employees have no choice as to the fund into which the contributions are directed&mdash;employees are entitled to expect measures to exist which protect those funds that are set aside for their benefit. Broadly based superannuation arrangements have now been with us for six years. While still in its infancy in many ways, the superannuation industry is a rapidly growing collection of professionals and financial institutions. Money under control of superannuation funds currently stands at $169 billion. Superannuation funds are estimated to increase to between $300 billion and $600 billion by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that superannuation in Australia is now on the threshold of adopting a regulatory regime and structure which is unique in the OECD world. To move to a single entity superannuation fund trust structure, involving codification of trustee responsibilities, is a development which overseas countries will observe with a great deal of interest. The Australian system of super fund regulation could well become the template for regulation in other countries. In this regard, it is worth noting that the Goode report in Britain has made a number of recommendations which are in keeping with certain SIS provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I am very surprised to read that the government believes that the reviews of superannuation should cease. The assurance of a hands-off approach to allow the industry to settle down after the SIS bills, apart from some finetuning, is not, I would say, a welcome comment. There are many unanswered policy questions which must be answered. Dr Fitzgerald, for example, has called for a final report since the government has promised each time it has unveiled major changes in the last five years that it would be the last change. To close down the debate on super policy would be a dangerous course of action. The reviews which have taken place in recent years have played a significant role in getting the superannuation industry to where it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be forgotten that the superannuation industry is also becoming a great source of tax revenue. Last year, the 1992-93 year, the tax on superannuation funds reached $1.522 billion, an increase of 33.6 per cent on the previous year and a massive increase of 180 per cent on the 1990-91 year. Five years ago the tax just did not exist. The threefold layering of superannuation&mdash;at entry, in the fund and on exit&mdash;as practised in Australia, is a unique feature in this country. Other countries have only one or two superannuation taxes, not three. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which I have the privilege of chairing, tabled its ninth report on the SIS legislation in the last week of sitting. The committee received nearly 100 written submissions. It convened public hearings on the bills in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. In addition, informal meetings were arranged between the committee members and officers of the ISC at which amendments to improve the legislation were discussed. I thank the government and the members of the ISC for their participation. I think the end result is that we have a much better regime. It just shows that cooperation between the parliament and the executive can contribute to a better overall result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While addressing many issues and making a number of recommendations, a number of these recommendations deal with areas of superannuation apart from the SIS bills, which I will not specifically refer to now. The committee has recommended amendments to the SIS bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill is the central plank of the new policy platform. It contains provisions which will radically alter the way the superannuation funds operate. It is designed to increase the level of prudential protection provided to the superannuation industry, strengthen the security of superannuation savings, and increase the protection and rights of superannuation fund members. Given the magnitude of the proposed change, it was not surprising that the committee received 97 submissions and agreed to take evidence from more than 60 witnesses, representing the interests of superannuation providers, regulators and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the SIS legislation has been clause 64&mdash;formerly clause 63 of the SIS bill&mdash;which contained a blanket prohibition on superannuation funds acquiring assets from members or members' relatives. Of the submissions received by the committee, approximately one-half of them&mdash;particularly from the very small businesses&mdash;were concerned with the impact of this clause. The object of clause 64, which is designed to take effect from 27 May 1993, is to be an anti-avoidance measure to prevent superannuation fund members selling their assets to their superannuation fund in order to obtain certain cash benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of the written submissions addressing this clause focused on the following areas of concern: first, that the complete prohibition was too harsh as it discriminated against legitimate business transactions and small business activities; second, that it prevented people from funding their own superannuation and therefore particularly discriminated against the self-employed; third, that it failed to take into account the same types of investments held in different names; fourth, that it appears easy to avoid simply by interposing another entity between the superannuation fund and the member&mdash;we did ask the ISC to look at this to try to overcome this particular problem; and, finally, that it imposed a gaol sentence for breaches, which we believe is too severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report of the committee has recommended that the following types of assets be allowed to be acquired from members or members' relatives: freehold or leasehold property which reflects true market value that is used wholly and exclusively in the business of the member or member's relatives. During the committee stage I intend to move an amendment to modify this particular provision so that for excluded funds, that is, fewer than five members, there will be no more than 40 per cent interest and for others, that is, more than five members, 25 per cent interest will apply as a means of putting in place a further prudential control to make sure that it could not be exploited to the detriment of anybody involved. Assets able to be acquired also included listed securities, which means shares, units, bonds or debentures, rights or options, or any other security listed for quotation in the official list of a stock exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee further recommended that the sole purpose test be strengthened to ensure that any asset or assets included in the exemption provided under clause 64 acquired by the superannuation fund from a member or member's relative does not contravene the sole purpose test. Another major issue surrounding clause 64 is the penalty of two years gaol for a breach of the provision. When comparing the appropriateness of this penalty, one has to have regard to the severity and nature of the mischief that the provision is designed to prevent. In some circumstances, gaol may be appropriate but in other circumstances it is too harsh. The committee recommended that penalty points be introduced and that the time period be reduced to one year, and the final result of the opposition's amendment, which I foreshadow, will be to limit it to one year's gaol sentence because the crimes provisions provide that one year's gaol is equal to a 60 penalty points fine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional power over superannuation and state public sector superannuation schemes was a problem. The Commonwealth does not have a single and exclusive constitutional head of power over superannuation. In its first report the committee recommended that the government explore the possibility of obtaining a referral by the states of their power over superannuation. The issues arising from the SIS legislation indicate that this is now a central issue. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the government revisit the recommendations of its first report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The referral of superannuation powers from the states to the Commonwealth was further highlighted in the application of the SIS legislation to state and territory public sector superannuation schemes. Following representations by the states and territories concerning the perceived infringement by the Commonwealth on state rights as a consequence of certain SIS provisions, the committee has recommended that the government negotiate with the states and territories to have their super schemes exempted from the SIS legislation. Clearly, if there was a referral by the states and territories of their power over superannuation to the Commonwealth, such exemptions would not be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered at length proposals to allow superannuation funds to have enhanced access to tax file numbers. I need not remind the Senate that TFNs and their use arouse a number of sensitivities about privacy. The committee heard compelling evidence about the need to use TFNs to allow the new eligible rollover funds to work efficiently. However, there was equally compelling evidence from the Privacy Commissioner on the need for caution in expanding the use of TFNs. The committee recommended&mdash;and I expect that the SIS bills will ultimately be amended accordingly&mdash;that superannuation funds be allowed to use TFNs for taxation and transfer of benefit purposes and that this provision take effect from the date that the bill receives royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of actuaries and auditors under the SIS bills is a matter which has not been the subject of intense or widespread media scrutiny or comment. Yet, after the watchdog activities of members, auditors and actuaries will be the first line of defence in detecting any wrongdoing by fund operators. The committee has recommended increased auditor protection to correspond with the increased responsibilities of auditors. In addition, it has again recommended that consideration be given to the establishment of a register of suitably qualified superannuation auditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major focuses of the report was on the impact of the SIS legislation on public offer funds. These now account for $14 billion of super savings and are currently operated on a dual entity basis between the trustee and the fund manager. Arguably, the most significant change to the superannuation industry by the SIS legislation concerns the requirement that public offer funds cease to operate on this dual entity basis and move to a single responsible entity. This accords with the recommendations contained in two Australian Law Reform Commission reports. Obviously, such a single entity requirement represents a massive departure from the current operating structure, the magnitude of which is incalculable when one considers the membership and investments in public offer funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the committee fully supports the single entity approach, it is concerned at the lack of accompanying transitional arrangements for such change, particularly in the area of who should be appointed as the single responsible entity and how any conflict between the two entities should be resolved when it arises. From the written submissions and the evidence, it became clear that the government will need to monitor the transition process closely to ensure that unnecessary confusion and uncertainty does not occur. The last thing that super needs is 200,000 disaffected retirees who have money in a public offer fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has maintained an interest in maximising the welfare of consumers under the new super regime. The committee recognised that if the new super system is to work it must have the support of the public. In order to get this support, consumers must have confidence in the integrity of every facet. Vigilance, by both government and the industry, is needed over the day-to-day operation of all super funds. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will be the vanguard of this initiative. The committee found that the tribunal should have a wide-ranging brief in all matters except medical evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommended that another layer of accountability be instituted. This will take the form of providing members with an independent advisory service which, initially, would be funded from consolidated revenue. The coalition intends to move a number of amendments which I will outline during the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has been involved with this package of bills since its appointment in 1991. To this end, in its first report it set out the parameters and in subsequent reports `fine-tuned' its approach to superannuation. This report is the culmination of work on the regulation of superannuation. During the process it became increasingly apparent that specialist committees have an important role to play in complex legislation such as the package of bills currently before us. It is also apparent that the new system of referral of bills to committees allows public and competing views to be taken into account in the passage of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overwhelmingly, the superannuation committee worked in a non-partisan way in reporting on the bills. As Chairman, having succeeded Senator Sherry, I wish to give special thanks to Senator Sue West who was my deputy, Senator Bruce Childs, Senator Chris Evans, Senator Alan Ferguson and Senator Cheryl Kernot; the secretariat staff comprising Richard Gilbert, Krista Gerrard, Glenn Hunter and Cath Drinkwater; Gary Johns, for the work he did in his supporting role; and the ISC officers, including the Commissioner, Trevor Thomas the ISC policy officer, George Pooley and Donald Duvall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is, as I have mentioned, a blueprint for other countries to set up superannuation regulation mechanisms. However, in closing I must issue a note of caution. The mere enactment of legislation to regulate superannuation funds does not guarantee security for members of funds. It is now the job of trustees, members and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, as regulator, to hold the superannuation system together. The ISC, as the committee has said time and time again, needs to be pro-active, alert and an effective regulator. I believe it has done this exceedingly well today and I wish it well in the future under its capable leadership. These bills give the ISC that power and it is now its responsibility to discharge its newly established statutory obligations. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills arise out of the need identified in the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Super</EMPHASIS>, for a better system of supervision and regulation of the superannuation industry. They also arise out of a commitment the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) gave the Australian Democrats when we agreed to pass the superannuation guarantee charge if, and only if, appropriate prudential supervision legislation were passed by this parliament. The Treasurer said he would do so; it has been a long time between the SGC being enacted and our debating these bills today&mdash;an election campaign has intervened&mdash;but I am pleased that we are taking the steps we are this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Collectively, this package before the chamber marks one of the most important legislative packages this year. It provides a proper system of prudential supervision and a simple disputes resolution process for superannuation funds which already account for more than $169 billion in assets and a membership of 70 per cent of the Australian work force. I think it is fair that the Democrats can take some credit in that, after 10 years of regular change to superannuation&mdash;usually the old legislation by press release&mdash;the Democrats moved in early 1991 to establish the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These SIS bills, as we call them, have been the subject of extensive public debate since their tabling last year. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has also held hearings on the bills. It proposed a range of amendments in its ninth report, which Senator Watson has outlined, and most of these amendments have been accepted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Bill, is, in our view, the most important of the seven SIS bills. It codifies the protection and rights of superannuation fund members, it increases the security of their savings and details black law standards for the conduct of the superannuation industry. It is one thing to compel people to put their money in; the other half of the equation of responsibility for us is to make sure that, because of appropriate prudential supervision, that money is there when people need to draw on it. The bill also expands the powers and the role of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, establishing a single pro-active industry regulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters encompassed in this bill include the constitution, powers and types of superannuation funds; the roles and responsibilities of trustees, managers, custodians and employers; arrangements governing investments, assets and reserves of superannuation funds; the treatment of fund surpluses and unclaimed benefits; the obligations of auditors and actuaries; and provisions to protect fund members from losses incurred through fraud or theft. As we can see, it is extremely comprehensive. The bill replaces many provisions of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act of 1987 which are to be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill, the Superannuation Industry (Resolution and Complaints) Bill, will require funds to become more accountable to their members by giving access to a low cost dispute resolution mechanism. If disputes or grievances cannot be settled within the fund, members shall have a right to review by a new Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Consequential Amendments Bill 1993, in conjunction with the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Amendment Bill, amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Supervisory Levy Act 1991 and other acts following the repeal of sections of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act. Consequently, the Bankruptcy Act 1966 is amended to better protect superannuation and life insurance moneys in the event of bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next bill, the Superannuation (Financial Assistance Funding) Levy Bill, in conjunction with the Superannuation (Rolled-Over Benefits) Levy Bill, provides for the imposition of levies on certain superannuation funds for the purposes of recouping the cost of maintenance by the ISC of a register of certain rolled-over benefits. The government estimates that the additional resources needed by the ISC to administer the act will be $4.83 million in 1993-94. This will be collected under this new levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulations to be issued under part 19 of the SIS bill will require disclosure of fees, charges and commissions relating to superannuation. This is an issue that the Democrats and others have been particularly concerned about. This was covered by the sixth report of this select committee. I take the opportunity to urge the ISC to consult widely in framing these regulations to ensure that the interests of consumers are fully protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the additional action yet to be taken, the position of consumers vis-a-vis the funds will improve dramatically under the legislation. However, I must make the observation that, with seven new bills and possibly 1,000 new regulations to add to the morass of law governing superannuation, the likelihood that consumers will be fully aware of their rights is becoming increasingly remote. Despite the efforts of consumer groups, unions and superannuants associations, there is still effectively no single body to which fund members can turn for advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, the Democrats have called on the government to support the establishment and funding of independent community based superannuation legal and information centres. These centres should follow the trailblazing success of the consumer credit legal centres, which have already proved their worth with settlements for consumers set to total more than $5 million this year. To ensure that the benefit of the service is extended to all states, consumer groups estimate a set-up cost of something like $666,000 for the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this goes further than the Senate committee report recommendation, I really would urge the government to consider undertaking to provide such funding. I intend to move an amendment to require the minister to provide access to independent advice. I will also move an amendment to clause 16 of the resolution of complaints bill to achieve this. I will also move an amendment to clause 23 of the tribunal bill to expand the right to representation before the tribunal to include complainants with a limited ability to speak, read or write English or where the tribunal would consider it necessary in the interests of fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further consumer issue of concern to the Democrats has been the stated intention of the government to exclude complaints over disability claims from the jurisdiction of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. The Senate committee has taken evidence of problems which consumers have had obtaining payouts on disability claims from some superannuation funds. Documented stories of claims taking many months to process and of trustees accepting the advice of the insurer without any proper consideration abound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stress that such treatment adds to individuals already suffering from physical and financial loss is worthy of our attention. Although the Senate committee has recommended a partial expansion of the tribunal's jurisdiction to cover procedural fairness and disability claims, I would still urge the government to go further and to provide full access to the tribunal even on medical grounds. Inclusion of complaints on such medical grounds has been successfully handled by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Veterans' Review Board. I think one can argue that limitations on jurisdiction are likely to cause significant disputation and confusion over the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SIS bills contain a number of new rules governing the investments to be made or not made by superannuation funds. Part 8 provides a range of rules governing the level of in-house assets funds will be permitted to have. These rules should help to avoid a repeat of a Robert Maxwell style run-down of employee superannuation funds by an employer. Part 7 of the bill also prohibits lending of assets to members of superannuation funds and the buying of assets by the fund from members of the fund. This latter provision in clause 64 has probably become the most controversial aspect of the bill and most of the submissions to the Senate select committee dealt with this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the government has argued that clause 64 will close a significant tax avoidance provision whereby members transfer assets into superannuation at a concessional tax rate. The arrangements are used primarily by the self-employed who already account for about $2 billion of the $5 billion the government forgoes in superannuation taxation concessions. The government has argued that the provision will ensure that superannuation funds are preserved and used solely for the accumulation of retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, small business groups, the Law Council and the accountants association have argued that the government is seeking to crack a walnut with a sledgehammer. In particular, the Democrats are concerned that the clause, as it was originally drafted, could adversely affect smaller superannuation funds. There appeared to be an assumption that members of small funds were incapable of running their own investment funds without engaging in tax avoidance; in other words, tax avoidance was their primary motivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee was critical of clause 64, and a majority proposed that an exemption should be made available for certain marketable securities and for business freehold or leasehold property leased wholly and exclusively for the purpose of a business. Personal property of a member used for private purposes should remain excluded. I will wait to hear the government's arguments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not leave this debate without talking about our continued disappointment in relation to the rules governing investment by superannuation funds and our disappointment at the reluctance of the government and the opposition to countenance some small direction of investment. If one looks at what has already been raised by the superannuation guarantee charge, one sees that total funds in superannuation rose to $169 billion by June of this year. These are in funds controlled predominantly by a small number of large institutions. Of that $169 billion, some $26 billion was invested overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of our call to look at that, and that the committee's first report said it would review it after three years. Time is ticking on. I am pleased to see, though, that the institutions, through the Australian investment managers group, have started to exercise considerable collective clout on the stock market. As Jennifer Hewitt noted in a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It all means that even small shifts in institutional thinking have the potential to give a powerful kick to the market because of the immense value of their investments.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to note that this is being acknowledged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have always argued that as superannuation funds are to be our major pool of capital, a small percentage of that money should be required to be invested in the national interest. We are not talking about the notion of picking winners; we are talking about the fact that there are ways in which we can do this. It can be done for the benefit of the nation as a whole, and those people who are willing to take this longer term risk ought to have the opportunity of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Savings in the hands of trustees are governed by a rationale which is totally different from that contemplated by free market theory. Fundamentally, because of fiduciary duties made even clearer by these SIS bills, trustees are in the business of risk aversion rather than wealth maximisation. This is demonstrated in the holdings of superannuation funds, with 55 per cent basically in blue chip stock and almost 40 per cent in cash and interest bearing deposits. There is no nationalism&mdash;no national interest&mdash;about risk aversion. I think it is a worry that at a time when many dynamic small Australian businesses cannot get access to capital for love or money there is almost $26 billion in assets invested overseas. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have called in the past&mdash;and we repeat the call&mdash;for the establishment of a national development fund, made up of just one per cent of the assets of superannuation funds, to provide venture capital for Australian firms. We have also called for restrictions on the amount that can be invested overseas. With such a massive pool, given a major boost by compulsory superannuation contributions, members of the Australian public have a right to expect that at least a small proportion of their funds will be invested in developing the nation's future. It is not true to say that people would automatically lose out, because the benefits of anything which adds to overall economic development are shared by all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to note that the government has belatedly realised the importance of the big institutions in the Australian stock market and that the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities is to inquire into the role of institutional investors and their impact on capital markets and corporate regulation. That should be an interesting inquiry. Perhaps we can already predict what some of its findings will be. I commend this very important package of seven bills to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this package of superannuation bills, which for the most part will be of great benefit to our ever-growing superannuation industry. I support my colleague Senator Watson and the comments that he made in speaking to these bills both as a Liberal senator and as Chairman of the Select Committee on Superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it is fair to say that most consumers will not even be aware of the superannuation industry supervision bills&mdash;that probably is one of the problems that Senator Kernot was alluding to in her contribution&mdash;but I am sure that they will appreciate that through these bills their funds will be safer and the industry will be placed under far more stringent control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the committee which looked at these bills so thoroughly, I am pleased that so many of the recommendations that have been made have been agreed to or certainly are under consideration by the government. Of the recommendations that were made, a vast majority have been accepted and a couple were considered to be unnecessary. There really were only three major areas of concern at the end of the day. I hope that the amendments that have been circulated by Senator Watson will satisfy the government's wishes in regard to these three major areas of concern. I think that is a very good result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of committees in bringing about these changes to legislation is not often commented on in this chamber. I would like to place on record my belief that the exhaustive process that the committee has gone through has been very worth while, particularly in this case. One of the witnesses who appeared before the committee certainly endorses this view. During our public hearing in Melbourne, Mr John Fraser, director of John R. Fraser Pty Ltd, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We little thought when we sent our original submission in August that we would have the opportunity to expand on our thoughts. It is extremely pleasing to see that the top level of government extends the courtesy and consideration to people such as me, because we believe that we are pretty small time.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that only highlights the effectiveness of this committee and many other committees in giving the opportunity to average Australians, no matter how small their businesses may be, to at least put their point of view before a Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I would like to draw the Senate's attention to my major area of concern&mdash;clause 64. Under this clause the government is seeking to prohibit funds from intentionally acquiring assets from members or their relatives and from providing any other financial assistance to members; attempting to resolve the sole purpose test, which is to determine whether a super fund is operating solely as a fund to provide retirement benefits; and aiming to prevent abuses of current legislation where members sell personal assets such as houses, boats, cars, et cetera, to super funds. This legislation proposes a penalty of two years gaol for breaching this clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the issues raised during the hearings and in most of the evidence that we received, this was the most controversial, the most troublesome and, I believe, the most difficult to come up with a meaningful resolution for. While I hope that the compromise amendment will satisfy the government's requests, I would like to point out that there are still several problems raised by this clause, not the least of which, as evidence would suggest, is that perhaps it can be legally circumvented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that there should be a relaxation of the blanket ban on funds acquiring assets from members and members' relatives; that funds should be allowed to acquire at market value leasehold or freehold property that is used wholly and exclusively in the business of a member or a member's relative; that funds should be allowed to purchase certain strictly defined marketable securities; and that the penalty should be a maximum of 200 penalty points&mdash;that is, $20,000&mdash;and/or 12 months in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those decisions of the committee were taken only after a lot of discussion and deliberation. I am sure Senator Chris Evans, who is in the chamber, will remember that there was a considerable amount of discussion on these issues, and it was probably the only area where there was any disagreement of any major proportion in the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment has been drafted so that, if the asset is classified as `business real property', the acquisition of that property, together with any other business real property previously acquired, does not exceed 40 per cent of the total value of assets of the fund for excluded superannuation funds, and 25 per cent of the total value of the assets of the fund for other types of funds where there are employee members. I believe that the situation that we arrived at after all the discussions took place was very reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, if this amendment is passed, a member of a superannuation fund or a member's relative will be able to sell assets to super funds only under limited circumstances. I personally think there are valid arguments that the definition of assets should be wider, but I can live with the compromise that we have reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem lies in the fact that, as far as I can see, these same limits will not be applied if members sell their assets to someone else's fund or if they sell their asset to another company which then onsells the asset to the fund. Because of this, the amendments will be meaningless to the people who have figured out some way of getting around those regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us say that Senator Chris Evans and I both had our own superannuation funds. Under the SIS legislation, I would be prevented from selling my commercial property bought for investment purposes, investment art works, insurance policies or unlisted securities to my fund. Senator Evans would be prevented from selling his similar investments to his super fund. But under this legislation I can sell my investments to his fund or he can sell his to my fund, provided we are not engaging in any anti-avoidance measures. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this does is add another personal company to the equation, at a cost to the fund member because of the added costs involved in going through another party&mdash;extra stamp duty fees, costs of selling, et cetera.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During evidence given to the committee, Mr Ian Kincaid, the director of Supermaster Investments, after outlining a situations I have just described, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think for once you have got to get a step ahead of some of the lawyers and the smarties around and get back to the very basics. What are we trying to prevent? We are trying to prevent, firstly, bodgie investments going into super and, secondly, this happening at unreal prices. These are the only two issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, these issues would only begin to be addressed in relation to members and their relatives. Any other Tom, Dick or Harry&mdash;I suppose in these days I had better say Sue, Jane or Mary for that matter&mdash;can sell assets which satisfy the sole purpose test to super funds. I would like to quote from Mr Fraser's evidence to the committee. He said that the only beneficiaries of clause 64 will be `life offices, banks, additional cost collectors, dodgy promoters who will quickly find alternatives to rip-off the superannuation system. I really believe that'. They were Mr Fraser's words when he was giving evidence to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many suggestions were made to the committee about better ways of handling this issue. One of those suggestions, from the Trustee Companies Association, was that the trustee be permitted to acquire assets from the member or relative of a member where the trustee is satisfied that the investment complies with the covenant prescribed by section 49(2)(f) and is acquired for a price certified as a fair market price by a valuer appointed by the trustee and independent of the member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Geoffrey Doyle from Priestly and Morris suggested that a prohibited asset be defined as the principal place of residence, motor vehicles or a listed personal-use asset as defined under section 160B(2)(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. So plenty of suggestions were given to us as to the way we should go about it. Hunt and Hunt submitted to the committee that the clause should control the type of asset which a trustee might invest in, instead of the identity of the vendor, and that the identity of the vendor ought not to be significant as long as the investment is appropriate, commercial and at arm's length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to the second issue which I was concerned about&mdash;penalties in relation to a breach of clause 64. I am pleased that the amendment circulated by Senator Watson recommends the reduction from two years to 12 months, because I do not believe that the public would want a person who sold his or her own home to a superannuation fund, for instance, as a breach of those guidelines, to receive the same sentence that might be applied to someone who committed a serious violent crime. With the way penalties are going in our courts these days, it is quite possible that the auditor could get two years gaol under this legislation for a breach of the penalty but that a guy who shoots the auditor for doing it might finish up serving only the same amount of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to place on record that, following the release of the committee's recommendations, the committee has been criticised strongly by the chairman of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, Mr Robert Brown, for not going far enough. He said clause 64 is `unnecessary, ineffective, unprincipled and farcical'. However, as I have stated, I am pleased with the agreements that have been reached, even if I personally may have hoped for more in some areas, particularly in relation to clause 64 and the definition and purchase of assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that this legislation can be built on in the future. I will be keeping a watch on all these areas where the government has indicated that the committee's recommendations will be taken into consideration. In particular, I will obviously be keeping an eye on what happens with regard to clause 64.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the superannuation bills because I wish to point out to the government that there are some matters in relation to superannuation that it has not yet dealt with and that I regard as urgent. These seven bills, as has already been stated, strengthen and codify the prudential standards for superannuation funds. I do not think anybody who has spoken or participated in this debate doubts the need for this or fails to support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in spite of the number of bills that have gone through the parliament since the Labor government came into operation&mdash;there have been something like 80 pieces of legislation in 10 or so years that have dealt with superannuation&mdash;I do not think that the government has really come to terms with the fact that retirement income is a very important issue in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not yet seem to have recognised that the quite rapid ageing of the population into the years of the next century will have a significant impact on a lot of people. There will be fewer taxpayers than at present; there will be more people beyond working age. There is, I think, an urgent need to deal with retirement income policy in a realistic fashion, particularly for women, who so far have been virtually ignored by Labor's policies. I am not suggesting for a minute that the government has not done anything at all, but it has not dealt with half the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures indicate the considerable increase in the amount of money that has gone into superannuation funds&mdash;from $32.6 billion in 1983 to $140 billion in 1992. With the superannuation guarantee charge, that amount will rise significantly. So it is absolutely essential to deal with the management of the funds&mdash;to see that that is done properly, that there is little risk of funds failing and members' money being lost, and that there is a minimum risk of fraud, misappropriation or things of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee on Superannuation, whose report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding super</EMPHASIS> has been quoted tonight, stated that it was `conscious that increases in superannuation savings will inevitably attract operators who will seek to use superannuation moneys for their own use'. That is pretty strong stuff and it is important that the government has responded, I think, with the legislation we have before us tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, the legislation sought to regulate indirectly. This package of bills regulates more directly. But it is the other areas that I mentioned that still need to be pointed out. There are three in particular. The first I refer to is the fees and charges which are being charged by superannuation funds at the present time which erode the value of super. It certainly does so for those who are part-time workers, of whom women form a considerable section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is the inability of anybody who has been out of paid employment for more than two years to pay into a super fund. Again, significantly, it is women who fall into that category. I can see absolutely no rational explanation for why that should continue, why we cannot devise rules for superannuation which enable it to continue beyond a period of two years so that one could start paying in again in the future, why one cannot have a superannuation fund that remains intact when one changes employers. Every time someone changes an employer, what has been paid in becomes virtually worthless because the amount that that person receives back when that happens is so little, as I have mentioned previously when I have spoken on these issues. It can be done if one has the will to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect I want to mention is that superannuation is dealt with in Family Court proceedings following the breakdown of a marriage. Certainly superannuation is taken into account as property&mdash;but not as superannuation, not as retirement income. I do not think that the Labor Party recognises superannuation for its own value and importance. Indeed, some of the legislation that has been brought before us suggests that the government has looked at superannuation more as a means of revenue raising or as part of a wages package in the context of industrial bargaining&mdash;not as retirement income for its own intrinsic value. I think it is time we confronted the very unfair treatment for women in particular that occurs as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women receive lower wages than men. Either they are still not getting equal pay for work of equal value, or they are not getting the opportunity to do work which pays the same wage rate as that received by men. Two-thirds of women earn average incomes below $21,000, while the average income for the same number of men is above $21,000. As I said, either women are not getting paid or they are not getting the opportunity to participate. As a consequence, they get a smaller benefit at retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australian women constitute the majority of the aged population and they will continue to do so. That is clear. For that reason, they are being disadvantaged as they get to an age beyond which they are able to work and increase their own income. The traditional male patterns of work which seem to be still the basis of superannuation do not favour women and do not give them an opportunity to participate. Superannuation is based on people being virtually in one job for the full 40-odd years of their working life, in full-time employment, coming to retirement age and then moving into superannuation. A lot of women now are doing that, but they are a very small proportion of the total. With a bit of imagination, with a bit of will to include women in superannuation schemes, this could be changed. I believe it will be a long time before most women fall into the male work pattern, which is the basis of superannuation at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I mentioned being out of the work force for more than two years. As I conceded, it is not just a female question, but frequently that is the case. Why can a superannuation scheme not be individual to a person so that during your working life your employer can pay into it what should be paid while you are employed; so that you can contribute to your own superannuation scheme from such savings as you may be able to contribute during your working life; so that you may be able to pay into your own superannuation scheme money that you come by, perhaps by way of an inheritance or a lucky day at the races. In many instances in a divorce settlement there are cases where a woman receives a certain amount of money and she may well be better advised to place that sum of money into her own personal superannuation scheme than to deal with it in any other way. That is not so in all cases, but in many instances that may in fact give her much better retirement income in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are about two million women who are not in the paid work force who are totally denied access to superannuation because the basis of superannuation is that you have to be in paid employment. There is no reason why there cannot be retirement income schemes of the same kind we are talking about tonight for somebody who is not in paid employment for the whole of her life, perhaps not in paid employment for very much of her life, schemes that give heer access to retirement income of the kind that she will need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Superannuation in the context of the Family Court has been dealt with in other places and I will not go into it in detail tonight. I merely remind the Senate, and in particular the government, that in many instances the female partner in a divorce does not have superannuation. When we take into account the value of superannuation at the time of divorce as an item of property, it does not indicate its true value in the longer term. It does not ensure that the other party in fact has superannuation in the longer run. I think it is time for the government to deal with that aspect and I hope it will do so before too long. </PARA>

Superannuation entitlements were available to a significant number of respondents in the survey of Family Court cases. For example, in the sample of applications for approval of s 87 agreements, 45% of men and 15% of women were said to have these entitlements.(24) The Australian Institute of Family Studies survey, summarised in chapter 6, disclosed that, amongst younger couples, just over 50% of husbands and 8% of wives were members of superannuation schemes; and that amongst older couples just under 50% of husbands and 16-19% of wives were members of such schemes.(25) However, both studies demonstrated that superannuation is often ignored and, when not ignored, is not taken into account in any clear or consistent way. The Australian Institute of Family Studies research showed that in many cases, even amongst the older respondents, superannuation was not taken into account in property division. It was taken into account in only 46% of possible cases according to the older men and 39% of possible cases according to older women. Amongst younger couples, it was taken into account in only 38% of possible cases according to men and 20% of possible cases according to women.(26) Where superannuation had not been taken into account three quarters of the survey respondents claimed that they had not received advice that superannuation was relevant.(27) This is despite the fact that, where the value ascribed to the superannuation is added to the general pool of property, superannuation ranks as a significant asset. The absence of superannuation and life insurance policies in the pool of available property pushes the average share of property currently going to wives down by about 10% according to women and by about 5% according to men, when taking the older and younger groups together. The inclusion of superannuation would therefore have a significant effect on the overall shares.(28)</PARA>

She has been doing this for some time; she has been in and out of jobs of this nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She did not even know that money was paid by her employer for superannuation under the superannuation guarantee levy. But in fact it was and, over the period I just mentioned, some $165 was paid to CANPLAN Multi-Industry Superannuation Plan 330, which was the superannuation fund that her employer paid into. Regrettably, an employer regards the levy virtually as a tax, which it is to the employer. The employer has no reason to take any interest or concern in what happens to the contribution that he or she is forced to make. Of course, the employee does not contribute at all. So off goes the money into some unseen superannuation fund which does with it pretty much as it seems to like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Mrs Mehta left this period of employment, in fact nearly 12 months later, she received a cheque for $34.69. The employer, as I said, had paid $165 and a bit more. The super fund had deducted $137.30 by way of charges. She got $34.69. That has nothing to do with retirement income policy. It has nothing to do with providing for people when they get to the end of their working lives. The outrageous charges and levies which operate mean that, for these sorts of people, there is almost nothing left at all. In a minute I will give honourable senators a couple of instances where there was nothing left at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employees have no choice about where the money goes. In many instances, they do not even know that it has been paid on their behalf. In my opinion there is no sincerity in the government's policy of superannuation when it sets up a structure which totally ignores the needs of itinerant, casual, part-time people in the work force. These people fulfil a significant role. I wish to quote from a letter that was written by two people who work in the industry of harvesting fruit and vegetables during certain times of the year. The letter states in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year (1992-93) my husband and I worked for a number of people as harvest workers. At each new place of employment we were enrolled in a superannuation scheme of the employers choice&mdash;we were given no  opportunity to discuss or choose a plan, in fact in nearly every case it was done without any consultation with us at all. As a result we were enrolled in four different plans, twice with the same company!</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to point out exactly how much of it was gobbled up by the administration levies and taxes. They refer to the number of phone calls made and the reams of paper used before they received any information about what had happened to the money that the employer had paid into the employer's chosen plan. There was no reason why the employer should take any interest; to the employer, it was just a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is not working for casual employees, part-time employees or itinerant employees. It is a massive waste of money that is doing nothing to benefit those whom, allegedly, it is supposed to benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two people worked at four different places. One job involved picking cherries and I am not quite sure what they were doing at the other three, but in each case the employer paid the money. In one instance, in the end, the wife got back $6.39 and the husband got $7.50. Each of them got back $88 from another employer and absolutely nothing from the other two, which were with the Australian farm superannuation plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to concede that the government has attempted to legislate to make superannuation meaningful but, in my opinion, it is very significantly on the wrong track and not dealing with the needs of a very significant section of the work force. Until that need is met, those who, as a consequence, will be doomed to have nothing but the age pension when they retire will very likely be much worse off than they would be at present, given, as I stated at the beginning, that the number of taxpayers in the community will inevitably decline as the population ages, and people live much longer beyond working age than people have in the past and make demands on the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This could be easily rectified if the government set up a personal superannuation scheme for those who have turned 18, so that moneys could be paid in by the employer and the employee, and other moneys could be paid in by other people or as it becomes available. People who are out of the work force because they are unemployed for more than two years, as at present, or women who are out of the work force for five years while they have children and look after them while they are young, would find the money still available and not gobbled up with administration charges and levies, which is what presently happens. In the end, we would have a superannuation scheme which would be meaningful and worth while for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us a raft of legislation designed to add some supervision and regulation to the superannuation industry. We think it is entirely appropriate, especially given the push to include people in superannuation funds to reduce their future reliance on the old age pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anything, we feel the legislation does not go far enough. We see massive amounts of unfunded liabilities in superannuation funds. One Victorian public sector superannuation fund has been reported in the business press to hold $16 billion in unfunded liabilities. This is more than the maximum that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) proposes to allow for the national debt. Parliamentary information service estimates of nationwide unfunded liabilities are at least $80 billion. Certainly it would be a problem for both workers and the government if some of these funds started to go down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our initial worry about the superannuation legislation package was that, if the government made a guarantee to members in respect of their superannuation, it might get into real trouble if, for example, the Victorian fund collapsed. We were reassured by government that the legislation would not cover the members in this case because the legislation covers fraud and clear mismanagement, but not commercial mishaps. The difference between mismanagement and commercial mishap is that one is the result of corrupt or highly dubious investment while the other is a result of permissible investment which in some way corresponds to industry norms.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Most of the problems in Victoria occurred as a result of investing according to industry norms of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I wish to make is that, if such bad investment leads to situations where the financial community reports major problems and very large funds are not covered, this legislation will not cover members very well or really guarantee the security of their government enforced superannuation money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern we had at the beginning involved how the government would take on a supervisory role if it chose to do so. There are many problems with government directly making investment decisions on so massive a scale. There is also the potential and some justification for the idea that the public should ensure that such publicly enforced savings are invested for the benefit of the community. But the reality depends on the integrity and goals of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked, therefore, what levels of supervision there might be and what criteria there would be for acceptable or unacceptable investment. The response was very laissez-faire. We were told that supervision would be minimal and attained through requiring auditors and others to report suspect practices. Along the lines of deregulationist ideology, the regulation of the industry would be minimal. Only practices that fell clearly outside industry norms or normal diversity would be questioned or picked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is an industry norm? In some respects, it is reflected in clauses in the legislation. Investment should be `adequately diverse' and ensure maximum returns without creating insupportable risks. This translates into conventional investment strategies used in banks, insurance agencies and other big storehouses of money; that is, to play the global market in what has been described as casino capitalism. Some money goes into longer term stocks and bonds, but a fair bit of it goes into the potentially lucrative area of short-term finance and playing the stock market, the bond market and the currency market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted here that this is a new phenomenon, having its roots in two changes: the deregulation of the global financial market, such as the London financial city in 1980; and the development and proliferation of communication and computer technology, which allowed investors to speculate globally at speed. It is worth noting that we are not talking about the speed of an investor on a direct line, but the speed of one computer speaking directly to another computer. That is what we are looking at with this amount of money in Australian investment funds. Our concern as Greens is that the direction of this funding is becoming more and more concentrated and that our participation in global financial deregulation and speculation is forming the basis of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose our major concern is that without access by consumers to information about superannuation investment portfolios, capital for sustainable industries within the country may not be made available. If the kind of regulations or lack of regulations in this very important industry lead away from the capacity for such ethical or more sustainable industries to access finance, it would be a great concern. The very least we can expect from government is the capacity for individual consumers to be able to access the information about where their investment funds are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the very minimum that should be available to consumers of compulsory superannuation funds is information about where that money is spent and invested. Therefore, if a large government or industry superannuation fund directed its  resources towards industries which are perhaps socially unacceptable, even though they might be profitable, especially in the short term, people would be able to lobby either their fund managers or the company in the public arena for more options to be made available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not suggesting that people could necessarily direct where their investment could go because not everybody is an investment manager. But we do say that it is extremely important that if one believes&mdash;and in this chamber, most people express the belief&mdash;that the market process is the way choices should be made, then one of the very first principles of the market is that people act after being in receipt of full information. The Greens would add that profitability is not the only basis upon which people make choices as consumers. If one even pretends to be interested in the market as a mechanism, one cannot disagree that the ability to find out where one's compulsory funds are being spent is a very important principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of disclosure is central here. There is no way of knowing even whether a fund is ethical unless one knows the investment strategy and where one's money is going. We flagged putting forward an amendment to this measure to ensure that members and potential members of public issue entities and of funds people choose to belong to can not only ask for information but be entitled to receive information on where their portfolio is located. We have phrased our suggestion so that information is available on demand. It would not be a requirement that every fund provide that information for every member every year, which we realise would be impractical and very expensive, but on demand people would have the right to find out the portfolio of their prospective superannuation fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing section says that the commissioner may set regulations requiring disclosure. I am very grateful that the government is now suggesting that in the near future&mdash;that is, by early next year&mdash;there will be regulations that actually specify the ability of prospective members of superannuation funds to access this information. At the moment, the legislation itself does not guarantee disclosure for public sector funds or non-public sector offer employer sponsored funds. These are the funds which are not voluntary, the funds employees must join as a condition of employment. There is no freedom to respond according to conscience. The government did not at the time of drafting deem it necessary to allow people to know where their money was going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that all people should be ensured at least some basic option for choice and expression of their values in long-term investment of their moneys. If any government is serious about looking at a sustainable economic structure in the future, the source of funding is extremely important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 64 of the superannuation supervisory bill was a problem for us, as it was for many others. The consistently strong criticism should be taken as an indication that there are real problems with this section. We recognise the need to stop rorts. It seems clear that when trustees or fund managers arrange things so that they can obtain use value for holding an asset they are obtaining an improper benefit. We think that a lot of senators who have problems with this clause would agree with this principle. The disagreement on the bill is not about motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel that focusing on members rather than trustees appears to allow rorts to continue as long as they are not assets donated by or acquired from members. There needs to be some change to this. If it is possible for clause 64&mdash;which we believe currently is a legislative mess&mdash;to be improved, the Greens WA would consider supporting appropriate amendments which would seek to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support regulations which aim to supervise an industry which is capable of creating huge problems, due to its size and diversity and the nature of the current financially deregulated system in Australia. It was our concern that, in the bill's original form, there was a great opportunity to make sure that investment funds in Australia were not simply directed by the electronic financial market of the day into the concentrated hands of fewer and fewer large corporations. Consumers should have the ability to find out where their funds are going, especially in the case of compulsory funds. There has to be the basis for informed choice&mdash;whether it is for ethical reasons such as people not wishing to invest in the arms industry, not wishing to invest in destructive forest practices, or not wishing to invest perhaps in the tobacco industry. People at least have a choice and can make informed decisions on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By supporting the bill in general, we would like to ask that the government use this opportunity to make sure that funds in Australia made available through superannuation requirements are not used in a way that is detrimental to the future sustainable development of this country. </PARA>

Generally, I would like to thank the various speakers for their contributions and to respond to a couple of points before we move to the committee stage to deal with the numerous amendments that we have before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, this government has made some very significant changes to superannuation retirement incomes in this country. On election to office in 1983 we realised that the then superannuation regime was largely confined to higher income earners in the public sector, who were overwhelmingly male workers. It covered less than 40 per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an aging population. At the present time, one in 10 persons is over the age of 65; by the year 2020, one in five persons will be over the age of 65. We therefore identified a need to move to a largely self-funded superannuation retirement incomes policy over the next 30 years. In doing that we have enacted a range of provisions including such fundamental reforms as the superannuation guarantee charge. The fundamental reforms that the Labor government has made were driven significantly by the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer. The two major social reforms that this government made over the last 10 years were in the area of Medicare and superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Watson for his contribution to the debate, particularly as the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I thank Senator Kernot for her contributions, although we do not agree with the allocation of a small amount into a national interest fund. I think she mentioned the sum of one per cent. I cannot go into the reasons for that tonight because of time; they are many and varied and we have discussed them before. I thank Senator Ferguson for his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot say that I thank Senator Reid for the number of points she made in her contribution. All I can suggest is that she have some discussions with Senator Watson. The points she made are not necessarily valid in the overall context of superannuation. Time does not permit me to rebut the contribution she made this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we will deal with the issue of ethical investment in the committee stage when we get to the amendment that Senator Margetts is proposing. For the record, I quite explicitly state that it is the government's intention to proceed with the requirements to allow a fund member to ask for and require a superannuation fund to provide full information on the investment portfolio of that fund as well as all other important matters relating to the fund.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is committed to ensuring a democratic information process to fund members. This shows that the government is firmly of the view that we need a much more participatory and informative superannuation regime than we currently have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the issue of increased democratisation of superannuation is quite critical.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to hear this because it will create a line of unpaid commitments until after 1 July. It is not in the interest of beneficiaries to have their payments held up for a further seven months. The government, by its action, has signalled to every trustee around Australia that there is a double jeopardy and that they would be foolish, if there is any element of doubt about the payment, to make a payment to a beneficiary before this bill comes into effect. There will be an immediate implication of withholding every payment that is due where there may be any element of doubt. A trustee just could not afford to take the risk either on account of himself or in the interests of the fund. It creates a double jeopardy situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the tribunal comes into effect we will have a whole line of issues. I will give honourable senators a typical example. A bona fide payment may be made to a widow. The de facto comes along after 1 July, lodges a complaint with the tribunal and the tribunal says, `Yes, you have a case. You might be entitled to 50 per cent' or whatever the portion might be. The money was paid out in good faith and in full knowledge of the facts as they then existed. Then the tribunal comes along. The Liberal Party had problems about the tribunal because of the possibility that it could undermine the financial standing of the fund. With the government's move tonight, I believe that it has the capacity to undermine the financial standing of small funds. It has the capacity to delay the payments made to genuine beneficiaries in good faith and create a double jeopardy position. I think it is a retrograde action. </PARA>

The government certainly did not give him any indication that we would be proceeding with these bills through the committee stage tomorrow, as I am informed. The second point I want to make is that I know that the decision to negate the adjournment was taken very late&mdash;about five to 10 minutes prior to 10.30 p.m. Senator Harradine's office was rung and he was uncontactable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was perfectly logical for anyone to conclude that the second reading debate would not finish by half past 10. The fact is that the second reading debate did not finish at half past 10. I am now told that a few minutes before putting the question that the Senate do now adjourn, the arrangement was made by the opposition. My office was not contacted and no message was left. My office has an answering machine for when my staff are not there and it is cleared regularly. I had five messages on that answering machine between 9.30 and 10.30, all of which were answered. It has been admitted to me that the call was made only two or three minutes before the normal time for the adjournment debate. That is not a proper way to run this place.

We attempted to contact him. Certainly, the arrangements were made just prior to 10.30 p.m. I have admitted that. I was involved in those arrangements. I was not involved in contacting his office, but I understand that attempts were made to contact him. As Senator Harradine rightly points out, the legislation is important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to pay tribute to a remarkable woman, Mrs Helen Robinson OAM. Recently, I had the honour of launching a book which records her achievements. The foreword to Lorna Howlett's remarkable biography of Helen Robinson encapsulates her contribution. She says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Helen Robinson is a person whose life personifies the Australian ideals;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;strongly independent and full of determination in pursuing her ideals,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;yet ever compassionate in her selfless work for the genuine needs of others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her reputation has been earned through a lifetime of service in the interests of the aged, sick and countless other charitable causes which will ensure that her efforts will never be forgotten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The book on her life will serve as a valuable, permanent reminder to future generation of not only her pivotal role in making ventures like the Mayflower Retirement Village a reality, but also the many other achievements of this exceptional individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Helen Robinson story is one of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;selfless dedication,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;strong Christian beliefs,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;prayer for what can only be described as miracles, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;absolute faith in God's inspiration.</PARA>
<PARA>Lorna Howlett's book makes clear the contribution Helen Robinson has made to so many lives. Lorna draws on the many experiences that Helen has had including her nursing work with her husband, John, in Nauru and the inner suburbs of Sydney; the establishment of the Mayflower retirement homes; and her overseas trips. Her greatest achievement is the establishment of the Mayflower Retirement Village and hospice in Gerringong. It is a remarkable achievement and the fulfilment of one of Helen's dreams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the biography, Lorna tells the story of Helen visiting a cold, bleak, abandoned, old Methodist church in Waterloo in Sydney at the age of 17 and making her promise to God to help the aged in our society. Helen can now look at the results of this vision that she and her husband John had inspired and know that her girlhood dream has been answered. Thankfully, the work that Helen has undertaken has not gone unnoticed. In 1979 she was awarded the New South Wales female citizen of the year and in 1984 she was awarded the Order of Australia Medal for her work in aged care. Helen Robinson's tenacity, dedication and vision is best summarised in the book by an extract from a letter of support for Helen's OAM nomination. The extract reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Gerringong Mayfield Retirement Village complex now stands as a result of the vision and driving force of Helen Robinson and I have observed from the inception of this project how her incredible faith and personal energy has encouraged others to overcome the obstacles which sometimes seemed insurmountable.</PARA>
<PARA>Lorna Howlett's biography of Helen Robinson is a book that I can recommend to everyone. There are so many inspirational stories in this book. Stories such as the terrifying cyclone on Nauru and the heartbreaking tragedy of the Vietnamese boy, Duc, show why we can learn from the strength that Helen has shown throughout her life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, there are very few people who can claim to have achieved all they have dreamt of in life. According to the biographer, other than an interest in helping aged people, Helen has had three personal desires which in her very limited leisure time she allowed herself to dream about. These desires were to speak in the House of Commons, to open a shop and to take a course in speech and drama. It is to Helen's credit that she can say she achieved all three dreams. At the age of 81, she completed a course in speech and drama through a London school earlier this year. She did open a shop and she addressed a meeting in the British Houses of Parliament building. Although she did not actually speak in the parliament, tonight she is being spoken about in the Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend this book to everyone here as an inspiration for our own lives. I would especially like to thank her biographer, Lorna Howlett, for allowing us to know Helen Robinson more intimately through her book so that we may be inspired by the Helen Robinson story. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government is aware of the Grameen Bank program in Bangladesh, and the significant impact it has had on the lives of its borrowers, both in terms of raising incomes and giving many people, especially women, opportunities for leadership roles they previously lacked. Beginning in a single village in 1976, the Bank now provides loans to over a million borrowers. Loan sizes are typically less than $100 and are provided for small enterprises in areas such as trading, shopkeeping and handicraft manufacture. A number of independent reviews have confirmed that the activities of the Bank have had a significant impact on the poor in those areas in which it has been active, with incomes of borrowers increasing by between 30% and 50% on average, with corresponding improvements in other indicators of welfare. Loan repayment rates exceed 95%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bank has received substantial support from international and bilateral donor agencies, such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development, Sweden, Norway and Canada.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Over the past few years, there have been several attempts to replicate the Grameen Bank approach (GBA) in other countries, some of which have been supported by the Grameen Trust. Micro-enterprise development programs using other approaches are also gaining in popularity internationally. Currently, the Grameen Trust is promoting an ambitious proposal to expand GBA replication programs, and it has sought donor funding of US$ 100 million from bilateral donor agencies world-wide, including Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential for small-scale credit schemes to assist the poor has been recognised by the Government, and the  Australian aid program has been involved in such programs in a small way for several years. The Government is currently considering whether there is scope for increasing support for small-scale credit schemes through its aid program, both to alleviate poverty and to encourage private initiative. The request for support of the Grameen Trust, and other possible initiatives, will be considered in this context weighing other competing priorities for aid budget resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a key part of this process of assessing the potential of small scale credit schemes, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB), is hosting a workshop on the topic of micro-enterprise development on 11 and 12 November this year. The workshop will bring together small-scale credit  and business development practitioners, non-government organisations and academics from Australia and developing countries to consider the role of micro-enterprise development in poverty programs and to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches to such development. The results of the workshop will provide an important input into the Government's consideration of what part support of small scale credit schemes will play in Australia's aid program in future.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The technical trial of the fuel Diesohol in the Australian Capital Territory's Internal Omnibus Network (ACTION) is being funded under the Commonwealth's Climate Change Program because Diesohol has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The trial is being evaluated by the peer reviewers for the trial, Society of Automotive Engineers and DASFleet. </PARA>

This particular improvement was achieved by directly exploiting the space previously occupied by the Director General's Office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 September 1993 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 920), Senator O'Chee asked me a question without notice concerning the effect of the Commonwealth Banks amendment Bill on the operations of the Commonwealth Development Bank (CDB).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the Commonwealth Banks Act will not lessen or remove the existing last recourse aspect or the CDB's function. Under its amended charter. the CDB will still only be permitted to provide finance where part or all of that finance is not otherwise available at reasonable terms and conditions. Rather, the amendments will strengthen the CDB in its commercial operations by ensuring that the CDB is not restricted to only considering  the supplementary  element  in  a</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">borrower's financial requirements. This will enable the CDB to match return and risk more effectively in respect of each customer. while retaining the CDB's traditional `last recourse' role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows that the opportunity of a farmer with a first and second mortgage to obtain supplementary finance will not be diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CDB's traditional agency arrangements with some twelve commercial banks in Australia will not be disturbed. The CDB provides a range of services consistent with its charter, viz, term loans, equipment finance, equity finance, and advice to borrowers, and does not seek to displace a borrower's normal banking arrangements.</PARA>
