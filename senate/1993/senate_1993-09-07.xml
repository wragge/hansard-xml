<TITLE>Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is simply the reintroduction of the bill I introduced into the Parliament on 26 March 1992 and which lapsed due to the dissolution of Parliament prior to the election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons for this amendment bill are still exactly the same as they were in March last year and have been strengthened by the evolution of the debate during the last twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill seeks to repeal part of the Australian design rule No. 19.01 which deals with electrical connections on motor cycles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the Australian design rule which has come into effect as of l March 1992 is to force all new motor cycles that are sold from 1 March onwards to have the headlight wired in such a way that when the engine is started the headlight will automatically come on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are dealing specifically with clause 19.6.106.9 of the Australian Design Rule No. 19.01 of the Motor Vehicle Standards Bill 1992 which we are moving to have repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government seems to have neglected to consult with the users regarding this new regulation. In my experience no one single motor cyclist has been pleased to have this design rule forced upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been much research into the pros and cons of having lights wired on. The key point is that when you look for the research evidence, both in Australia and overseas, you find that what is lacking is conclusive evidence that this measure actually adds to road safety. What this means is that the government hastily made this decision without properly researching the issue and has gone ahead without properly consulting those most directly affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision as to whether to turn on the motor cycle light during the day should be up to the rider. A responsibility, as with other vehicles, that is up to the driver. The majority of cyclists do turn their lights on for part of their day riding but surely experienced riders, who are quite adamant that having the light on can add to the risk, should be allowed to make their own decisions regarding safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the freedom of choice aspect there is the question of legal liability. It is not clear whether or not this bill will add to the liability of the motorcyclist who could be involved in an accident with a motor car. The difficulty lies in proving whether or not the light was actually on. The globe may have been smashed in the accident, it may have blown two minutes before the impact, or the day before. Along with the legal liability question there are the ramifications for insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new design rule could also add a false sense of security. People could believe that by having the light wired on it will somehow make them safer. This, in many cases, could be the exact opposite. Questions arise concerning the ability of some motorists to judge the speed and distance apart of an oncoming vehicle with its headlight on, thus adding to the danger, not to the safety on the roads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when this design rule is at its most ridiculous is with agbikes having to have their light wired on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I support most vehemently every effort to increase road safety, I believe that this issue of motor cyclists being forced to have their light on is a misguided move by the Minister, further highlighting that this Government is out of touch with the people of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. In its original form, this bill makes minor amendments to the principal act. A number of minor changes to the debt recovery provisions will be made, including clarifying family payment, overpayments and debts incurred over public holiday periods as a result of advanced payments. This bill will enable the department to recover certain debts relating to the child support scheme by way of direct deductions from benefits, pensions or allowances. Minor amendments will be made to the child disability allowance and these will limit backdating to 12 months, allow sharing of child disability allowance payments and clarify the 42-day temporary absence provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House of Representatives, the shadow minister, Mr Ruddock, recognised that the backdating of the child disability allowance may be an area where some discretion may be warranted and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) undertook to look into this matter. I have noted their comments and I believe that honourable senators here should also note those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also allows partners of people in gaol to be paid at the single rate. I understand that further minor amendments relating to the commencement of this initiative will be put forward and these will not be opposed by the opposition. The threshold for sole parent pensioner employment entry payments will be amended to exclude add-ons for dependent children. This is a beneficial provision that is also supported by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill excludes payments from the New South Wales Medically Acquired HIV Trust from the income test. The coalition supports this provision, and I have nothing but the deepest possible sympathy for the beneficiaries of this provision. I must admit that I do have some reservations about the precedent that this sets. However, we will not be opposing it. Without wasting the time of the Senate, all the remaining amendments including those in relation to investment income, the waiting periods for newly arrived residents, a more streamlined review process and overcoming possible dual payments will also be supported by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is seeking to use amendments to this bill to facilitate its partial backdown last week on the pensioner and veterans' shares issue. Honourable senators are aware of last week's caucus meeting&mdash;I am almost tempted to use a freudian slip and call it the `raucous' meeting&mdash;at which up to a reported 70 members and senators confronted the Labor leadership demanding changes to its budget of betrayal. They are also changes, let me say, to last year's budget because these measures were in last year's budget. Not only are they amending this year's budget; they are going back patching up the mess that they made in last year's budget&mdash;a mess that has left pensioners up in the air for at least 12 months. Many of them were very concerned and very worried about what was going to be the financial impact of treating unrealised capital gains on shares as income for the purpose of assessing the pension. In his media release after this telling meeting&mdash;as I said the other day, I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall at that meeting&mdash;the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that it had been decided to review implementation issues associated with the 1992-93 budget decision to assess capital gains and losses on shares for pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This in itself was a humiliating and embarrassing backdown for the Prime Minister, given that just over three months earlier he said in the House of Representatives, when he was debating some amendments we put through down there to try to have this unfair legislation repealed, that the opposition was `into revenge, obfuscation and just being villains'. He went on to call us `irresponsible, stupid people' because we dared seek to pass a private bill to repeal this harsh and inequitable measure. That is what the Prime Minister called us, villains; he said that we were obfuscating and that we were irresponsible, stupid people because we wanted that reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it again on the public record that, when the legislation went through, the opposition supported that clause of the legislation because we were in a bind. It was tagged to other legislation which gave benefits to pensioners. Those benefits were under threat and so we said that we would review it in government. We did not have that opportunity, unfortunately, and I am sure there are a lot of Australians now who regret the fact that we are not in government and so do not have that opportunity. The next best thing we could do was to do everything in our power, with the assistance of the Democrats, to bring this issue to a head and to have the government back down. It has backed down, but only partially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Prime Minister made these statements, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) was forced to make a monumental and embarrassing backdown of his own. He announced that all shares acquired before budget night, 18 August 1992, would be exempted from the shares provisions. The minister had stated repeatedly that the government did not intend to back down on this initiative. Over and over again he said, `We will not back down'. That was the message pensioners were getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a Senate inquiry received nearly 200 submissions and over 2,000 letters virtually unanimously condemning the government's plan, the minister gave pensioners little or no hope that the government would relent. Despite the fact that in excess of 200 pensioners attended each of the committee's three public hearings, the minister stood firm in supporting his department's proposal. The message that pensioners were getting was that the government would not back down. In fact, as the community discontent became more pronounced, the minister and his parliamentary secretary moved to quell this disquiet by selling their shares plan through the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage prior to last week's caucus meeting was any indication given by the minister that the government would back down. It is very important to understand this, because many pensioners, being concerned but believing that the government would not relent, had already sold all or part of their share portfolios prior to last week's backdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such person was a woman called Nan Prior, from Glen Waverley. She sold her shares the week before the backdown. She told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> after the backdown:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I sold my shares solely on the basis of the Government's commitment to the plan and now they've turned around and changed their mind.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the weekend I was chatting to someone who told me that she had sold her shares. She said that she had had a small shareholding as a result of a very small superannuation package and that she had sold her shares. This is a friend of mine that I knew as a youth leader in my childhood. She was very concerned about it and said that one of her other friends had done the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nan Prior, from Glen Waverley, as quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, believed that the proposal was `set in concrete'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Short rightly says, the Treasurer himself said they were set in concrete. That is the message that the pensioners were getting. Nan Prior is not alone. I am informed that a number of angry pensioners inundated a Melbourne talkback radio station last week and a similar station in Sydney earlier this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would these people not be angry? They have every right to be angry. Unwittingly, they have become the victims of this ill-conceived proposal. They sold all or part of their share portfolios in order to avoid this unfair income test. Now, in the light of the government's backdown, they find that there was absolutely no need to sell these shares. If they rebuy the shares that they have sold, they will be caught up in the same unfair income test that they have been attempting to avoid, quite legally. So if the people who sold their shares because they thought the proposal was set in concrete&mdash;so that the unrealised capital gains would not be treated as income&mdash;were to buy back in, they would get caught up in this system. No-one can blame any pensioner for selling shares. The government provided no indication that it was willing to relent in the face of concerted community opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, Mr Con Sciacca, went around the country last month informing media outlets that selling shares was a way around the government's planned income test. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Money</EMPHASIS> show on 11 August, Patrick Lindsay questioned Mr Sciacca on two occasions about the lack of purchasing power of a notional profit. He was asking, `Here's a paper profit: what's the purchasing power of that?'. On each occasion Mr Sciacca's response was, `Not if you sell it'. So he was saying that, if you sell it, it has got purchasing power. On Derryn Hinch's show on the same day, Mr Sciacca stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We then expect that before they access the social security system that they go to the source of their investments, that they resource everything that they can of their resources before they come to us.</PARA>
<PARA>Pensioner after pensioner told me that they mainly use the dividends from their small holdings of a few thousand dollars to pay their private health insurance&mdash;to keep out of the long hospital queues that this government has created. So they were using that dividend and hoping that the capital gain on their shares would mean that that dividend would keep pace with the ever increasing costs of private health insurance, over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With health the way it is these days, many people of 65 or 70 are looking at 15 or 20 years more of life, and they need to have some capital gain on that investment to make sure that they can keep pace. But Mr Sciacca says, `Use up all of your resources before you come to us'. Many of them were using those resources to avoid being on the public purse, in terms of health. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> the following day, Mr Sciacca was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If people save for their retirement. . . then they are expected to spend what they save. . . not to preserve the capital base that they have.</PARA>
<PARA>A great majority of these people have a very small capital base and, as I said, that dividend is basically being used to make sure that they stay as independent as possible, especially in terms of their health care. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> article went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that because stocks are easily and readily accessible in terms of realising it into cash, then a pensioner or retired person must first access the resources available to him or her before they come to the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA>In a radio interview with Matthew Abraham on 2CN the day before, Mr Sciacca made similar claims, both in the actual interview and also when answering a question put to him by a caller. In fact, Mr Sciacca has been making statements of this ilk for over four months now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 April of this year, he had an interview with Anna Reynolds on 4QR, in his home town of Brisbane, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it looks like they might have to sell their shares and put it into other income bearing deposits, well that's fine because the end result as I say is the social security system is based on the question of need and if people can properly use their moneys or their investments to be able to get some income and that takes some of the strain off the social security system then everybody benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>The combination of the government stonewalling on this issue and the repeated statements by Mr Sciacca, in relation to pensioners accessing their own financial resources before using the social security system, is extremely relevant to this debate. This was the official advice that the government was giving to pensioners and to veterans. It was advice upon which pensioners and veterans quite rightly based their investment decisions. It now turns out that the advice provided by both the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, and his parliamentary secretary, Mr Sciacca, was, in hindsight, hopelessly inaccurate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Pensioners have sold their shares which, it turns out, would not have been subject to the revamped government proposal. They have followed the advice of Mr Sciacca and realised their share resources, and they find that they will be disadvantaged because of it. It is unconscionable for the government to leave pensioners and veterans in such a position. This is a problem of the government's own doing. There is only one way that it can ameliorate this problem totally. That avenue is by forgetting this ridiculous proposal altogether. The coalition will move an amendment at the committee stage seeking to replace the government's latest proposal with the total repeal of the shares provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shares provisions are in a complete shambles. Originally, the government claimed that these measures would result in net savings of $62 million in 1993-94, rising to $80 million in each of the two subsequent years. Now the government's own estimates are that gross savings will be only $5 million in 1993-94, $11.4 million in 1994-95 and $16.4 million in 1995-96. Given that the government has admitted that it will cost some $2.4 million to implement its revamped shares plan in 1993-94, the net savings from this controversial measure in this financial year will be no more than $2.6 million. Why the pensioners and veterans have had to face over a year of worry and concern for the sake of a mere $2.6 million this year is a matter for which the government will have to answer at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also be realised that the government's estimates are best estimates. Like the original estimates upon which they are based, these estimates take no account of any change in pensioners' and veterans' investment behaviour that may result from this measure. So all the savings are based on the fact that pensioners will not sell their shares. We know that they are selling their shares. We know that, when their shares go up and that is deemed to be income, those that are now caught up in this system, newly entering pensioners, et cetera, will sell their shares. It is quite feasible that the actual savings from this measure will be considerably lower than the government now claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unreasonable that the government's latest position will actually have an adverse net impact on outlays, at least in the initial year. The government's own members of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs concluded in their report that the government's original costings were invalid. Importantly, they concluded that the government's plan was not fair, that it was not equitable and that it would create more inequity than it would save. Now, with the new measures, there is another inequity. There will be three classes of pensioners: the class of pensioners who bought shares prior to the budget in 1992; the class of pensioners who were in that situation, who then sold their shares, and who now, if they want to buy back into them, will be caught up; and the new class of pensioners who will be retiring with small amounts of superannuation and who will not be able to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have two major classes and a subclass in between&mdash;that group of people who believed that this was set in concrete. How foolish they were! I do not mean that they were foolish but they were led to believe this by the government, and they believed the government. I suppose people of that era used to believe in governments. They spent most of their adult lives under Liberal governments and they had been fooled into believing that under this Labor government nothing would change, that the government would keep this legislation in place, and so they sold their shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest backdown does not remove the fundamental inequity of the original shares proposal. In fact, it creates more inequity. It simply sets an arbitrary commencement date, after which the inequitable proposal will apply. It does not remove any of the concerns about the way the formula will apply. It does not rectify any of the comparative disadvantages of shares as against other forms of investment such as real estate and collectables. It does not address the widespread concerns about the adverse impact on national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under pressure from caucus, from its own members of the Senate committee, from thousands of pensioners and veterans, and from the investment industry, this aloof, out-of-touch government has belatedly recognised the absolute futility of this flawed proposal. It must now have the political courage to dispose of the harsh and inequitable measure altogether. </PARA>

The first committee to look at it was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. Unfortunately, in that committee the Liberal Party and the Labor Party could not be convinced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tell Senator Patterson that it is not rubbish, as anybody who bothers to go back and have a look at how it was presented can see. But those were the days when the Liberal Party was very reluctant to be in opposition. Those were the days when the Liberal Party believed that whatever was in the budget had to be supported. The budget could not be touched; it was all set in concrete or blocked in ice or whatever. In previous years when I have been in this chamber and in the time of former Senator Haines in this chamber&mdash;I was recently discussing this with her&mdash;the Liberal Party has rarely, if ever, opposed anything in the budget. One thing she could remember was the gold tax but other than that it was a very rare occurrence, partly, I suspect, because the Liberal Party is used to watching this Labor government pass what is really Liberal Party policy and is only too happy to be associated with it and indeed support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation passed through very quietly, even without many of those in the press gallery noticing what happened. The only people who noticed were a couple of financial journalists who take an interest in this area. Off it went. As we headed towards the election we heard very little. Indeed, when the Democrats raised this it was seen as a non-issue and basically it disappeared in the period over Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I must commend my colleague Senator Bell, who in Tasmania began to get behind him more and more pensioners on that island who were actually aware of what was going on and were very concerned. The Democrats' campaign began slowly after Christmas, asking people initially to write to the Liberal Party. Senator Bell himself wrote to honourable senators in the Liberal Party asking them what they were going to do about this. The election came and went and, as we all know, the Liberal Party was not successful. So any suggestions that they had made&mdash;I acknowledge that Senator Patterson in this chamber said that it was something that they would review&mdash;came and went with the election result. We had this measure ticking away, with pensioners gradually becoming more and more concerned. As pensioners became concerned we saw the Liberal Party also, to its credit, changing its mind and deciding that it would also be opposing this measure in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After writing successfully to Liberal Party senators, pensioners began to turn their attention to the Labor Party. We also began, through a wide range of pensioner organisations, to circulate petitions. I would argue now that this victory is not just a victory for the hard work of the Democrats and a belated victory also for the Liberal Party, which has recognised the error of its ways, but is a victory for ordinary Australians out there, for community action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government was embarrassed by what it had done, particularly by the retrospective element of it. We had people&mdash;younger pensioners in their 60s and 70s but also older pensioners into their 80s, people who no longer took any great interest in their financial affairs and just presumed that everything was going along nicely&mdash;who suddenly had to start seeking advice. They sought advice from financial advisers and went down to the local DSS office&mdash;in my state, getting some quite unfortunate advice from FIS officers who as late as last week were actually telling them to sell their shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Through all this advice and through all these hassles, many pensioners have been put in a very difficult position. As has already been outlined, some have decided to sell. The government has taken us right to the wire; if we do not pass this today we get an even more draconian measure. Unfortunately, some of those pensioners are now regretting the actions that they have taken but it is too late. This measure does nothing for those pensioners who have bought since last year and it does nothing for those who are in managed investments. We heard before the Senate committee that many financial advisers actually recommend those packages to pensioners rather than individual parcels of shares on the stock exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure also does nothing for pensioners when we look at the relationship between the income and assets tests as a whole. We also need to look at how, with the new push for people to have their own superannuation, superannuation relates to the pension system and what incentives, if any, are left for people to provide for themselves in retirement. What the Democrats are now calling for is a full and independent review of our retirement income system that includes not just pensioners but also part-pensioners and self-funded retirees. We need to look at how this fits together, where the incentives are and where the discrimination is. We need to look at the relationship between the income test and the assets test and look at what sorts of messages we are sending to people about how they plan for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to make sure that, not only is the retirement system geared to support people fairly, but that we give them some peace of mind in retirement. We should not put them in a situation where, year by year, they have to run off to financial planners and keep checking with the Department of Social Security. One pensioner said to me that it is almost as if it deliberately makes these changes when she is on her annual fortnight's holiday because she now feels almost obliged to have a regular update as to what has changed since she last kept an eye on things. One thing the government certainly has done is to activate pensioners to the point where they are actively following the financial pages of some of our more notable publications, trying to keep abreast of changes to the pension and retirement income system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just close by saying that, had this not been passed by the Liberal Party in the first place, we would not be in this position today. We are at the wire. If we do not pass this measure today it will go back to the House of Representatives and sit around. The government has made that very plain. It only has to let it sit for a day and bring it back on at the end of September and by then it will be too late because the original measure will be in place and quite a large number of pensioners will have lost part of their pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress here we are not talking about the millionaire pensioners that the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) seems to know about; we are talking about the 83 per cent of pensioners who hold $20,000 or less in shares. We are not talking about those pensioners who are at the upper end of the assets limit. Indeed, in this budget the government even further relaxed the assets test. For farm families I can understand that, but why on the one hand relax the assets test and on the other hand actually hit pensioners who have relatively small assets as they continue to accrue some assets and hedge against inflation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I believe the government has done is to send quite the wrong message about investment in Australian companies. It is actually discouraging people from maintaining an investment in Australia's future. By the way it has organised the assets test it is actually encouraging people to go off and invest in non-productive areas, be it antique clocks or jewellery, paintings on the walls or a holiday home, for example. It is doing this rather than encouraging pensioners to put their limited assets in an area that will actually help them minimise the pension because the more dividends they get&mdash;and they get far better dividends than they get out of a bank account&mdash;the less pension they need. I stress again, the government is sending quite the wrong message and the Democrats will be pursuing this issue, albeit through a variety of other means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I thank the opposition and the Australian Democrats for indicating their support for the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill. In respect of the amendments that are to be moved, one would have expected some disagreement, and that is occurring. I would say to Senator Lees that I do not think I know any millionaire pensioners. I have not met them yet, but they may be around and have thus far escaped my attention. The outer limits of our income and assets tests have been pushed a long way out in the last few years. So those who receive part pensions can now be on quite sizeable incomes by the standards of a lot of other families who do not necessarily have that level of government aid and support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been important to see, when examining where those income and assets test levels have gone, that their integrity is protected at every point. So it is not a matter of the government seeking either to be punitive or to push investment in a particular direction; it is simply a matter of making sure that the pension is paid to those who actually need it. That is what income and assets tests have been about&mdash;making sure that the income support is paid to those who require it. We can do that only by fairly and equitably looking at income and assets tests across the board. We have to make sure that there are not areas where people can seek an advantage that is simply not available to others. We do not want everyone jumping in to find a way around the tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have achieved through this amended measure is to make sure that the treatment of shares is going to be the same across the board. I would have thought that was really the kind of policy objective that any sensible government ought to pursue. I note that Senator Patterson will be proposing the complete scrapping of the measure. That is disappointing because, for all the reasons I have just given, we are pursuing a sensible policy objective. Furthermore, the kind of hysteria about the sales of shares that this measure was supposed to have engendered is really based on a false premise. There is no evidence whatsoever that there has been any wholesale sell-off of shares. In fact, the evidence is quite to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some have sold&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;but the idea that great numbers have sold simply is not true. It never was true. I said it when this legislation was last debated here. The evidence has never been collected because it cannot be. There is simply no evidence that pensioners engaged in a wholesale selling of their shares. All this measure does is make sure that those pensioners who have got cash to invest in shares or anything else are able to make the choice of investment knowing that, no matter how they seek to invest that money, whether in shares or other investments, they are going to be treated in the same way. I think that is the kind of policy objective that we ought to be pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that some people have sold over the course of the last 12 months, but because there has been no wholesale sell-off I think much of what the government has wanted to do here has been correct. What happened, though&mdash;Senator Lees correctly pointed it out&mdash;was that there was a big community reaction, which she and the Democrats did raise in here, which the members of my own party went to the caucus economics committee last Monday night and made perfectly clear to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in, as I understand it, stark terms. As a result of that jolt, as I described it yesterday, the government finally decided to take some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action having been taken to exempt all shares bought prior to 18 August 1992 suggests to me that what we have done now is absolutely fair. There cannot be any suggestion of any retrospective element. It is really when one gets into retrospectivity that one begins to cause some heartache and some pain. Now that even the suggestion of it has been removed, I believe that what we have before us today is a fair measure and one that will make sure that pensioners around Australia are able to approach their investments, knowing that we are not encouraging rorts and ways around the system and knowing that, if they invest in shares or other forms of investment, their income will be treated in the same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to respond to Senator Lees's remarks about our income and assets tests and how they might be reviewed. Not only the controversy over this issue but the kinds of inquiries we get and the kinds of judgments we make when listening to the department and its many offices throughout the country ensure that these matters are, if not kept under constant review, often looked at. I am assured that in the course of the next few months the minister and his department will be having a good look at the issues that have been raised here to see if any further changes are required. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add'', but the Senate notes the Government's own admission that Aboriginal well-being is not improving and therefore calls for an independent review of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission to determine the measures necessary to ensure an improvement in its performance in order to significantly lift the living standards of the indigenous population of Australia''.</PARA>
<PARA>The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) is the second of a series of three similar amending bills that the parliament is considering this year. All these amendments flow from the government's consideration of the review of ATSIC that the commissioners themselves completed in February this year just before the election. It was an urgent matter to have in place those improvements to ATSIC in time for the elections to take place in December this year. ATSIC has had its first term and its first period of operation. We now have had this review by the ATSIC commissioners themselves as to the best ways to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander decisions for programs to help the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am conscious, from discussion with the chair of ATSIC, Ms Lois O'Donoghue, a resident of my own state of South Australia, of the sincere, careful concern that ATSIC commissioners have for these reforms to the structure of the council, which is what we dealt with in the first amendment in our sitting back in May this year and now in this bill before us with four or five matters especially dealing with the election process for regional councils to be implemented in the election of December and with regard to some of the functions and responsibilities of advisory committees, deputy chairs of councils, and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third band of amendments, also flowing from the general advice of the ATSIC commissioners, is to see later this year a third bill, which will strengthen the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include powers to evaluate and audit regional councils, Aboriginal hostels, the CDC, land councils and ATSIC funded organisations, and make major changes to the arrangements for the Torres Strait, including the establishment of a Torres Strait regional authority. It is understood that the regional council arrangements as they relate to the Torres Strait are being deferred in anticipation of a regional authority in that area of northern Queensland being in place by the third wave of amending legislation later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the most significant changes are those that we have yet to face. I understand the government's wish to have more time to ensure that the appropriate amending bill is properly constructed and that it is precisely determined after consultation at each stage, that consultation to include the opposition's spokesman and representatives of the other parties in the Senate. The determination of that third stage of legislation must include consultation with the present ATSIC commissioners and Aboriginal communities generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition welcomes these three stages of amendments to ATSIC and to the regional councils. We support the legislation that is before us today. Later in my speech I will move an amendment to the second reading which, I hope, will gain support from honourable senators in the chamber. I look to Senator Kernot and I look to Senator Margetts. That amendment is currently being distributed. I will speak precisely to that amendment in the latter part of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to note that the principal reason why the opposition welcomes these three amending pieces of legislation to ATSIC is that they largely implement what we advocated in our policy paper of November last year. I refer to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ATSIC&mdash;the way forward: a policy for the next coalition government</EMPHASIS>, published after our party room's decision by Dr Michael Wooldridge, the then shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, on 5 November 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4.accountability on all levels of service delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>In this document we went on to argue that there should be a reduction in the number of commissioners from 60 to about 30. What we have seen already in the May legislation is a reduction to 36, and we welcomed that. It largely implements opposition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the regional councils we wanted to ensure that there was an ability for full-time executive action by the chairman of the regional councils; and that is being implemented. We want to see a decentralising of program management to the regions, and that is being provided for in this pattern of legislation. So it is not surprising that we are supporting the legislation which, happily, the government has written to accommodate us, and to accommodate, of course, the advice of the ATSIC council and its review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to ask a precise question of the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins. Is it envisaged that the third wave of ATSIC legislation will be introduced before 1 October? Otherwise, is it the government's intention that it will be introduced in order to lie on the table? That is, we will receive it perhaps late in November and be able to study it and then have the debate upon it early in the new year? As I understand it, the&mdash;</PARA>

But for the foreshadowed, substantial, further amendments I am asking if they will be introduced into parliament probably in late November so that they can then be debated and determined when we sit in March next year.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am wanting to hear the advice of the minister. With regard to any timing, we all need to know in the Senate chamber what the timing of the government is with regard to that matter. A second question I put to the minister relates to the implementation of wards. We have not the full detail of the precise number of wards and their definition in each region. By this legislation a maximum of five is to be required and I want to know what progress has been made in the definition of wards and their boundaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third question refers to clause 23 of the present bill. It relates to the understandable tightening of the disclosure by regional councillors of any financial interest they may have in a matter that is being discussed. There is a requirement that they seek the agreement of the minister, in writing, for their participation in any matter in which they have a direct personal financial interest. This is going to cause a problem with regard to the operation of a quorum in regional meetings. If someone who has a direct financial interest is required to not attend a meeting there may be, for want of that attendance, an inadequate number attending&mdash;in fact, not a quorum&mdash;and an inability for a regional council to transact its business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in the bush as much as anybody has, and I think it would be difficult to get prior warning of all matters before a regional council in which an individual councillor may have a financial interest. It would not be practical to fax a quick letter to the minister or to get the minister's reply in time for a meeting. I envisage that there may well be a practical difficulty in the operation of this new arrangement for the disclosure of financial interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to, and commend, a practice occurring for many years in this parliament. Whenever an individual participating in a decision has a direct personal financial interest he declares that interest openly and clearly. Not only does the individual declare that interest to his colleagues on the decision making body but he also declares it publicly. Having clearly identified his personal financial interest, it is then in the hands of the other members at the meeting to determine whether that individual ought to participate in the meeting or ought to leave the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that there will be practical problems in the outworking of this new provision. I ask for the minister's reassurance that there will be some flexibility in making sure that regional councils do in fact work. The amendment that has been circulated in my name adds to the motion that the bill be read a second time. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add: ", but the Senate notes the Government's own admission that Aboriginal wellbeing is not improving and therefore calls for an independent review of ATSIC to determine the measures necessary to ensure an improvement in its performance in order to significantly lift the living standards of the indigenous population of Australia".</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that there is such a serious failure of outcome in Aboriginal communities for the whole purpose of ATSIC&mdash;and for the whole purpose of public funding of Aboriginal programs&mdash;that there needs to be a review to ensure that we put in place a more confident set of programs that will improve the outcome for Aboriginal individuals and communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the speech on this matter given by my colleague Michael MacKellar last Wednesday, on behalf of the opposition, in the House of Representatives. He referred to three particular issues: the high proportion of maternal deaths in childbirth amongst Aboriginal women; the extraordinary incidence of diabetes amongst Aboriginal people, and the very high proportion of early deaths from those who suffer diabetes in Aboriginal communities; and the work of the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin with regard to the lack of child health care in Aboriginal communities. Whether we take these three examples or a whole range of other examples in health, housing and education&mdash;all of the indicators for the wellbeing of individuals, families and communities&mdash;we are distressed that the Aboriginal people of Australia are still, by a long way, worse off. The statistics still show a bleak picture for the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that it is now 26 years since the referendum that many of us participated in to change the constitution of Australia to allow the federal government to make laws for the Aboriginal people&mdash;laws that would develop programs. In those 26 years we have seen a certain range of improvements. Senator Kernot, who is serving on the commission for reconciliation, will have a good knowledge of some of those positive outcomes but there are too many static, negative outcomes and areas where we have not seen progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the $1,000 million that is provided each year to Aboriginal programs ought to be able to be reviewed by ATSIC. Through ATSIC's reports and through this parliament to the Australian public there should be some measurable improvements in these broad areas that affect the wellbeing of Aboriginal people in Australia. Those of us in the opposition are not satisfied that we have in place an evaluation process, a program of setting objectives and measuring outcomes against those objectives, to show how $1,000 million a year spent upon such programs is actually achieving the outcomes that we all wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to my visit in June to the Pitjantjatjara communities in South Australia. Over my 15 years in the Senate I have been to these communities about 12 times, beginning in 1978. I am very sad to say that, in the broad, the situation of these remote Aboriginal communities has become steadily worse. I say it with enormous sadness. There is more and more money; there are more and more programs, more and more housing initiatives, CDEP initiatives, education initiatives&mdash;but the outcomes are worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to Indulkana. Indulkana, at the moment, is a very sad example of what 15 years&mdash;or 26 years if we go right back to the referendum&mdash;of a large number of federal programs have provided for this community in my state of South Australia. Very few children go into secondary education in the whole of the community. The actual achievement level in the primary school is more at a ceiling of about level 5. The 10 years of bilingual education in English and Pitjantjatjara have now been abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I look at the health outcomes: there are more health problems now through communicable diseases, respiratory diseases, eye diseases and so it goes on. Television has had an impact upon the community. Drink is still a community problem. We need a review and we need it to be constructive.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the previous speaker, Senator Teague, has said, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 is the second of three bills to be introduced this session which will pave the way for greater autonomy and a stronger voice for Aboriginal people through participatory administration of ATSIC. This bill is the next step in preparing the way for the elections for the board of ATSIC. These elections are scheduled to take place in December.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last session, we passed legislation to establish a 19-member full-time board with 30 regional councils throughout Australia. The bill we are considering today goes on to establish a ward system to feed into the regional councils. It establishes interim&mdash;and that is the important word&mdash;ward boundaries for the purposes of the forthcoming election. These boundaries, I believe, are to be reviewed before the full elections take place in 1996. An independent review panel is to be established in the third bill. It will consider submissions and then determine ward, region and zone boundaries. This panel is to operate in much the same way as the redistribution committees established by the Australian Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC has argued that there are a number of salient reasons why a ward system is appropriate at this point in time. The Democrats accept ATSIC's rationale, which is essentially that, with a reduced number of regions, some relatively small centres of population are expressing concern that it will be more difficult for them to be represented in the enlarged regions, particularly as there will be significantly fewer representatives; that within enlarged regions there is concern that larger population centres and larger interest groups will come to exercise a dominant influence on a council; and that a ward system will allow regional councillors to identify more closely with the people of their ward and to be more sensitive to their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also outlines procedures whereby budgetary and other administrative functions will be devolved to regional councils. It seeks to ensure economic and administrative accountability at all levels. I believe that the provisions of this bill will go a long way towards addressing Senator Panizza's concerns, as outlined in his notice of motion calling for a review of ATSIC. Under this bill there is to be a tightening of provisions of direct and indirect pecuniary interest. The bill establishes the terms and conditions for office holders, including provisions for dismissal for misbehaviour. There are also provisions to limit spending on administrative costs to under 15 per cent of the total budget of the councils. If this laudable effort is actually achieved, perhaps it will be a model for other bodies. We have been really hard in what we have expected of ATSIC from the very beginning and in what we have written into the bill when we set up ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our primary concern in examining this legislation has been the future of ATSIC. If Aboriginal people are ever to claim their rightful autonomy, ATSIC, which has been proposed and set up by this government, must be strong and not vulnerable to politically motivated, malevolent attacks from either the white or the indigenous communities. It seems to me that there is an orchestrated anti-ATSIC campaign going on at the moment, not in here but outside this chamber. I think that the comments by some indigenous people in Australia aimed at ATSIC, while perhaps expressing a sense of frustration, are particularly unhelpful at a time when ATSIC is reviewing the first three years of its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is bound to be a problem when one imposes a monolithic structure which says that ATSIC is the voice of all Aboriginal people. It never can be. We do not expect that in our society. Nevertheless, it is a representative body and it deserves our support until it can be significantly demonstrated that it deserves to lose that support. I think it is important that the elections scheduled for December happen as smoothly as possible and that this new system of administration be allowed some time to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to what Senator Teague had to say in support of his second reading amendment. I would argue, as I said to Senator Panizza, that this bill puts in place procedures for review. Let us give that a chance first. We cannot go on forever blaming ATSIC, a body which is just three and a bit years old, for everything that is demonstrably wrong with the living standards of indigenous Australians. Why do we not compare it, for example, with a white-fellow's body like the CAA? Can we say that that has been a roaring success in recent times in terms of following due process or delivering the best outcomes for the people who depend on it? I do not think we can. So let us not be unduly critical of something that is only three and a bit years old. Why expect ATSIC in three and a bit years to solve the problems of the legacy of a couple of hundred years? We are talking about injustices of 200 years and we are talking about a structure that has had a few years in which to address those injustices, and I think we are being unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague referred to the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and I would like also to refer to it. We have got ATSIC, we have got the land councils, we have got the various legal services, we have got the Aboriginal community organisations and we have got the council for reconciliation. The good work that is being done there, I believe, must not be undermined by these orchestrated attacks on ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council has a rural subcommittee. That subcommittee has worked hard, through DEET, to bring indigenous and white pastoralists together in joint management situations. There has been a sharing of knowledge. It has been a very productive outcome for the pastoral industry. There is the mining subcommittee, which produced that marvellous report and which for the first time is bringing chief executive officers of the main mining companies in Australia face to face in the boardrooms with traditional Aboriginal landowners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to put in place the structures, as we are doing; that is important but what must reinforce and complement those structures is the dialogue. This dialogue is happening. There are proposals to set up a joint council of miners and Aboriginal people for future land management. There is incredibly new and important ground being broken here. I do not think it helps to start concentrating all the time on ATSIC and ATSIC's alleged failure to deliver, within a short period of time, solutions to a legacy of 200 years. We must stop this fixation. It is definitely not helpful. Progress is being made in this area. ATSIC is an important part of that progress. The Democrats support this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2). The major amendment provisions in this bill are to entitle members of regional council advisory committees to receive remuneration and allowances for their services. I will take them one by one so I do not have to go back over them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous position was untenable because of the sort of remuneration that commissioners used to get. It certainly was not enough to make it a full-time job or even for an attempt to get completely to the bottom of things. The proposed situation will improve the commissioners' lot no end and proper remuneration will bring forward a lot of better applicants for those positions. I welcome that part of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides also for, in regional council elections, a maximum of five wards per region. I have in the past advocated the ward system for ATSIC regional councils. The reason I have done so is that during my long term in local government I saw the effectiveness of a ward system. Any local government councils in Western Australia that have gone backwards over the last few years have been the ones that had done away with their wards. In a no ward system in local government, no-one is responsible for anything. That is how it worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were a few heretics in my local government council that wanted to do away with wards. First of all, it becomes loaded up with councillors from one particular area and everyone wants to be on board for the good things, the most popular things that happen to be going on, and less and less attention is paid to the hard decisions. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I certainly welcome this move. The only way to go is to divide it up into wards, as Senator Kernot has said, to give representation to small communities, especially those in isolated areas. Most of these communities are in isolated and remote areas anyhow, but some are more remote than others. I commend the government for putting this provision into the bill. It is something that I have said should have been happening for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next provision is the one relating to the declaration of pecuniary interests by regional councillors and members. I would go one step further than that and include anyone employed by a regional council. I have a motion before the Senate for an inquiry into the accountability of ATSIC. Senator Kernot is continually saying that there is a run on ATSIC around Australia, and she has referred to my motion at times, but the point is that my motion is about accountability. I reckon that, if there is to be accountability, people should declare their pecuniary interests. Honourable senators have to disclose their pecuniary interests, and I welcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot is trying to interject. I remind her that I said that I was happy to have honourable senators' pecuniary interests disclosed, providing that they are meaningful and providing that they are signed. There is one honourable senator on the other side of the house who did not sign his. When I reminded him of it the other day, he still had not signed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to the bill. I believe it is right that regional councillors and members should have to declare their pecuniary interests. I believe that anyone who is employed by those councils should also. I have seen time and again what happens with people employed by those councils. I am not talking about Aboriginals; I am talking about white people who are employed by them. Contracts go out to their friends or whoever, without even a tendering process or any of those sorts of formalities that are supposed to happen. So I believe that the provision should be extended to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another measure, which is to provide for the suspension from office of regional councillors and deputy chairpersons of regional councils. I do not know whether, in this democratic society, I really welcome that move. As Senator Kernot said, ATSIC is only two or three years old and it cannot, in two or three years, make up for what has happened in the last 200 years. I do not believe that in the last 200 years successive governments have neglected the Aboriginals totally. ATSIC took over from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I believe that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, whether under our government or Senator Collins's government, did do something for the welfare of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we could have the suspension provision for the next four or five years, but one day it has to get completely into the democratic system. In local government, a mayor or a shire president can be removed under certain circumstances. It is pretty hard to remove them. However, I believe that this provision should remain for only a short period. Let us get away from the concept that the opposition and others around Australia are solely out to undo ATSIC. The calls that have come to my office from around Australia regarding my proposed inquiry have been from Aboriginal people themselves. I want to see accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot mentioned the bills that are to come later to strengthen the Office of Evaluation and Audit and to include powers to evaluate and audit regional councils, Aboriginal hostels, CDC, land councils and ATSIC funded organisations. First and foremost under the ATSIC funded organisations should be the Aboriginal Legal Service. I am not going to run right into what I said the other day, because that is on record. Especially in Western Australia, it is something that needs to be well looked at. That legislation will come forward. Senator Kernot told the Senate that it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has said twice in the last few months that ATSIC should be inquired into because he has given qualified audit reports on it. But in relation to accountability, Senator Kernot, when this bill does come in it will not bring people to account for what has been done in the past. I know that we will have stronger provisions and I hope they will be carried out when they come in, but it will not catch up with the people that have ripped off the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission in the last few years. We are talking about a budget of about $1.3 billion which, to put it in context, is two-thirds of the gold mined in Australia every year. We have Senator Kernot down there giggling her head off, obviously laughing at my suggestion there be more accountability. I am worried about what has happened in the past and what the royal commissions in Australia, especially in the Labor governed states of the last 10 years, have been doing about accountability regarding what has happened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, the substantive thing to say is that the government welcomes the opposition's support for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. In saying that, I would like to address the specific questions that Senator Teague put when he addressed the Senate. Consistent with the earlier advice that I think both I and the Democrats got, that the third bill is currently being drafted and has been given essential for passage status this session, it is intended, all things being equal, to introduce the legislation into the house by 30 September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the question Senator Teague asked about pecuniary interest provisions, the minister will make determinations in advance on those issues and those determinations will be disallowable instruments. In rare cases, quick decisions by the commission chairperson who is to have the power delegated by the minister are possible. The section of the bill that provides that power is section 23(3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question that was raised on wards, Senator Teague noted the maximum number provided for but the actual situation is that the minister will make rules for wards once this legislation is passed and assented to. I might add it is very important that this legislation proceed through the Senate today in respect of the 60-day notice that is required for the elections to be held. It is proposed to have those elections in December as Senator Teague knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will make those determinations based on advice from ATSIC and ATSIC's advice will be based on the consultation workshops that were held with regional council chairpersons in June this year. Interim boundaries only will be provided for the 1993 elections. The bill will propose an independent boundary review process for determining regional council zones' ward boundaries for the 1996 elections and beyond.

I give that as one example of why I do not think there is a lot of profit in spending too much time rebutting the entire list of targets for the shotgun attack of Senator Panizza. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the honourable senator's major targets was the CDEP program. ATSIC has to this point in time carried out an extensive analysis of three-quarters of the 200 CDEP programs, I think from memory, that are being administered across Australia. The commission is going for 100 per cent but so far it has done about 75 per cent. The result of that analysis, which has been done in direct cooperation with the relevant government department, has disclosed only about one per cent incidence of problems in that scheme. What it has also disclosed is a far greater number of people eligible as recipients of social security benefits in those communities who are currently not accessing those benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not decrying for a minute the necessity to carry out these accountability provisions. ATSIC is certainly well aware of it and has got a major program of non-stop accountability. I suppose it is a difficulty if the commission has these processes and then is criticised for spending too much time on process and not enough on worrying about the delivery of the programs. Nevertheless, what I have stated has been the result of what I consider to be the most serious criticism that Senator Panizza has raised in earlier debate in this house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that I was intrigued this morning&mdash;I will follow it up this afternoon&mdash;to hear Senator Panizza say that there had been two calls by the Auditor-General for inquiries into ATSIC. I am not aware of either. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line of all this is that I do not think it has been demonstrated during this debate, in anything that has been put before the Senate, that one can at this point justify setting up another reference to a Senate committee for a major investigation of ATSIC, when by any measure it has set up comprehensive processes. This bill, indeed, is further evidence of the continuing progression of ATSIC's own initiatives in providing for greater accountability. I do not think that on any measure one could justify setting up at this stage a reference to a Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that I am not saying that an examination of the effectiveness of ATSIC is not going to be the thing to do at some future time, after the significant changes that we are now processing in this three-stage process&mdash;all of which are based on initiatives that have come from ATSIC itself&mdash;have been progressed, and after the organisation has had a chance to settle down, when the legislative base has been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make that point because it would be very helpful&mdash;for Aboriginal people on the ground&mdash;for that examination to be carried out at some future date by a Senate committee or a joint committee or a whatever committee, and for it to be carried out in a positive light, rather than in a negative light. If criticisms are to be made, that is okay. However, the parliamentary committee needs to approach this in an atmosphere of attempting to assist the organisation to provide a better delivery, rather than approaching it with a negative view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have addressed the major questions that have been raised today by Senator Teague and by Senator Panizza. On behalf of the government, I acknowledge the support given by honourable senators to the legislation, and thank them for that support.

That sort of money is being creamed off the Aboriginals by the white Aboriginal industry. By their actions those honourable senators have denied accountability. Senator Collins said earlier&mdash;and I give him credence for it&mdash;that there will be more accountability in time to come. But they are letting abuses of the past get off scot-free.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Amendment Bill 1993 and the Nuclear Safeguards (Producers of Uranium Ore Concentrates) Charge Bill 1993 are two bills that the coalition does not oppose. These two bills seek to impose a charge on commercial uranium producers to recover some costs incurred by the Australian Safeguards Office in conducting nuclear safeguards and physical protection programs which arise as a result of commercial activities. They are merely cost recovery bills, and they have the support of the coalition. Not only for these two bills but for many other bills that the government puts forward, it is the coalition's policy that, where possible and where community obligations are not prominent, cost recovery has the support of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charges are set at the maximum of $500,000 per year per company and two companies are going to be affected&mdash;the Ranger uranium company in the Northern Territory and the Olympic Dam company.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see a need to go into a long debate about this&mdash;the opposition has been accused of obstructing the Senate and this is one set of bills that we have no objection to. I will just raise one point that I think bears noting. When Michael Lee, the representative of the government, was responding to the bills in the other place, he said that there is no need to discard the third uranium mine policy because it is quite feasible for Ranger to increase production to meet any demand. That is not the case in point. Ranger's mine has just about reached the point where it is unable to increase production.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in a lot of areas the government may move to dry economics and economic rationalism, it is still the captive of the Left when it comes to the crazy uranium mining policy that it has. When the government is facing a million unemployed and a massive balance of trade problem, one way that we could create more jobs and reduce our overseas debt would be for the government to take a responsible attitude on the uranium policy. Even the members of the Right and the Centre Left would agree&mdash;I have heard a number of them saying it, I think even quite openly, and certainly former Senator Walsh used to say it frequently&mdash;that the government's policy just does not make sense. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the position of the Democrats in relation to uranium mining and export is well known. It was a foundation policy of the Australian Democrats in 1977 to oppose uranium mining and export. Indeed, although I was not a foundation member of the Democrats, I was probably the person in Australia who formulated that policy, as long ago as 1972. As a person who formed the Conservation Council of South Australia I formulated that as one of the council's initial policies. In 1973, when I was elected to the council of the Australian Conservation Foundation, I put it before the ACF; it was the first written policy of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Going back well before the formation of the Democrats, I had already adopted a strong position of opposing uranium mining and export from Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had taken that position after having been quite an enthusiastic supporter of nuclear power from the 1950s onwards. As a student of science, and later as a research scientist, it seemed to me that the argument that nuclear power would be so cheap that it would not even need to be metered was quite persuasive. However, by the late 1960s, it was becoming evident to me from reading the scientific literature that there was a great deal wrong with the safety of the whole nuclear power cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I looked at the inevitable links between the civilian nuclear power cycle and the use of nuclear facilities for the preparation of weapons, the whole situation became quite worrisome. Thus, in 1972, I adopted the position of opposing uranium mining. Nothing that I, or the Australian Democrats, have seen since has persuaded me that that position is not the correct one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the contrary, when I review the accidents which have occurred, the diversion of nuclear material into weapons, the total inadequacy of international safeguards&mdash;either at the multilateral level through the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the facilities of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or in relation to Australia's bilateral arrangements&mdash;I perceive that they are totally inadequate. They are pieces of paper which in no way can guarantee safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Australian Democrats support these two bills which seek to impose a charge on those who export uranium from Australia, under both the non-proliferation treaty arrangements and the bilateral arrangements which Australia has with a number of countries. These bills seek to recover the costs of the supervision of those safeguard arrangements. We have no objection to that as a matter of principle, because if Australia exports uranium, quite clearly those who lay the cost on the community of supervising those safeguards should pay that cost. That cost should not be borne by the community. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw that clear distinction between the Australian Democrat's fundamental objection to uranium mining and export and our support for this legislation in relation simply to the polluter-pays principle, or the user-pays principle, which means that those who commit us to those international safeguard obligations, by reason of mining and exporting uranium, should pay the cost of those safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a few words about the inadequacy of safeguards. The most extreme example of civilian nuclear non-safety was the Chernobyl reactor disaster. I invite members of the Senate to look at an article in a June issue of the journal of the International Atomic Energy Agency which was written several years before the Chernobyl disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That article was written by Dr Semenov, who at that stage was the Director of Nuclear Safety in the International Atomic Energy Agency. Dr Semenov had the oversight of the safety of all nuclear power stations in the whole world. He says in that article that he was actually one of the engineers who designed the RBMK 1000 reactor, which was the type of reactor at Chernobyl. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that article, Dr Semenov points out the essential safety of the Chernobyl reactor, claiming that there was no way at all that the Chernobyl reactor could have the sort of accident which we now know it subsequently had. I stress that it was the Director of Nuclear Safety at the International Atomic Energy Agency who made these claims several years before that Chernobyl reactor blew up&mdash;with the disastrous consequences that we all know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have claimed that the Chernobyl reactor fire&mdash;the losing of the top of the safety shield around that reactor&mdash;resulted in some tens of deaths. What the people who make those sorts of claims ignore is the fact that it spread vast amounts of radiation around the whole of Europe as far as Ireland, as far as southern England, and right through southern Europe as far as Turkey. In the long term, the number of cancers which could be equated with that radiation exposure may range up to a million, and they are additional cancers which would not otherwise have occurred in that European population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to turn to a couple of points that Senator Boswell made. Senator Boswell talked about the advantages of opening other mines. I would point out that for many years Australia maintained a floor price for uranium. I guess it maintained a floor price because it wanted a profitable industry and it reckoned that the $US30 per pound floor price was one which would guarantee that the industry was profitable. We all know that not so long back the government had to reduce the floor price and, if we take the figure in the minister's second reading speech, the value of 20c per kilogram which is quoted there works out at about $17 per pound for the current price of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply pose for the government and the opposition, but particularly the opposition, the stupidity of opening up other mines so we are then in the position of having mines which are competing with existing mines which have only just recently, through a slight increase in price, become profitable again. Having those mines compete, we would possibly export somewhat more uranium but certainly we would be exporting it at a lower price. That links very much with the question of safeguards. If we put ourselves in a situation in which, for economic reasons, we need to push the sale of uranium, there is a strong temptation to undermine the bilateral safeguard arrangements into which we might enter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the coalmining industry is a nice example of this. We have recently had a strike in which the coalminers were very concerned that negotiations had led to a lower unit price for coal exports. As long as coalmines in Australia compete with one another for exports it is very likely that the unit price will fall lower and lower, and to make any profit at all one will have to export larger and larger tonnages. It means that we exploit these non-renewable resources even faster and Australia finishes up sooner rather than later as a mined-out quarry with no resources left whatsoever, either for its own use or for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell also mentioned the question of employment, claiming that opening new uranium mines would lead to more employment. I think it needs to be restated yet again&mdash;unfortunately, yet again&mdash;that mining is now a very capital intensive activity. No matter how much more mining we were to open up, mining would not in itself lead to very much more employment. Mining is not the way to go if one wants employment. The costs per job in the mining industry come at a very high price. The opening of further uranium mines certainly would not lead to a large increase in employment. If the increased exports led to an excess of uranium on the international market and a fall in the price, it may well be that opening another mine would lead to no employment whatsoever and an undermining of the employment in the existing two mines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are another two issues that I would like briefly to raise. One is that the whole notion of safeguards, the very use of the word `safeguards' in relation to these multinational and bi-national agreements, is really a euphemism. It leads people to believe that there is such a thing as a safeguard. I come back to the point that I made earlier that, whatever agreements we enter into, either through the NPT or as nation-to-nation arrangements, they are simply bits of paper. Once the uranium leaves our shores there is no effective control that we can have over it, whatsoever. I simply witness the situation where the French supplied a nuclear reactor to Iraq, and other countries supplied uranium. Once that regime decided that it was not going to conform with any inspections, we all know the difficulty that occasioned. We cannot control the use of uranium or anything derived from uranium, such as plutonium, once it leaves our shores. So `safeguards' really is a euphemism for bits of paper which may, for a time, give some guarantee of protection but certainly can give no absolute protection, whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point, in relation to entering into the export of a dangerous material such as uranium, is the way in which it can be used, not only for civilian power development, but it can also be diverted into weapons development. Of course, Australia participated very much in this activity in the 1950s. It was Australian uranium that came back and was used in the British bombs which were exploded at Maralinga. That has polluted a vast area of South Australia and there is continuing controversy as to the costs and the efficacy of clean-up. The very fact that one exports this material which is so dangerous, and so linked with the potential for nuclear war, brings one's international relationships into an area that, in our view, it is not necessary to enter. If, for argument's sake, the money that we are spending on uranium mining and export was spent instead on things such as alternative energy sources, which are essentially renewable and are non-polluting, then one would not even need to enter into these safeguards agreements. They inevitably produce a certain amount of tension between nations&mdash;tensions that we can well do without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this very time, as honourable senators will have heard, we have a marvellous opportunity in relation to alternative fuels for transport&mdash;something that I have spoken about several times in recent days. We have the world's leading technology in many aspects of the use of solar energy for heat and for direct generation of electricity through photovoltaic devices. We would strongly urge that the government continuously review the benefit and the disbenefits associated with uranium mining and export, and that it should seriously consider getting out of uranium mining altogether and getting into these renewable and safer sources of energy which have enormously more value in terms of export potential as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, I simply come back to the point that these bills are user-pays type bills. If we are going to export uranium, then those who mine the uranium and involve us in these exports should pay the full costs of safeguards, such as they are. Therefore, we will be supporting the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the interests of brevity I will try to finish in the next five minutes. Firstly, in response to Senator Boswell, I thank him for taking into account our time constraints on this piece of legislation. One matter that I do want to rebut is his assertion that the Labor Party policy is a captive of the Left on this matter. That is certainly not correct. The party has a well-regarded, democratic, representative structure and a national conference which we attend every couple of years. That is the very open and democratic policy forum for these sorts of debates. Our policy is well known as a consequence of a policy adopted about three or four years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter raised a range of issues and, frankly, that did not surprise me, given the Democrats' position on the uranium industry. I do not intend to go into those issues today. The purpose of the two bills before us is to enable us to recover the costs of certain nuclear safeguards and related activities of the Australian Safeguards Office from Australian uranium producers. I welcome the support of both the opposition and the Australian Democrats for the principles and the details in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charge will be set by regulation each year on the basis of the approved program and the budget of the Australian Safeguards Office, following consultation with the uranium companies. Since the charge is not due to be paid until 1 December each year, there will be plenty of time for full consultation before it is collected. The government's international obligations on safeguards&mdash;legally binding under treaty-level agreements&mdash;will ensure that there will be no compromise on safeguards through the implementation of the cost recovery arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason that the uranium mining companies should not pay a reasonable share of the costs of nuclear safeguards that are applied in connection with their operations and exports. Those who benefit from a service or activity should pay for it on the basis of full recovery of attributable costs, provided that national interests or community service obligation components are funded wholly by the government. The specific amounts to be recovered are reasonable and defensible. There is adequate consultation with those being required to pay.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I informed the Senate only a few days ago, Australian electronics firms are carving themselves a very effective place in the market internationally with their capacity to produce world-class electronics equipment and telecommunications equipment. I mentioned a number of the companies that have successfully exploited market opportunities for the provision of technology such as microwave landing systems, in which I think, arguably,  Australia is leading the world at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Beahan has indicated, the Minister for Communications leaves tomorrow to lead a trade mission to Asia. The trade mission is being conducted under the auspices of the telecommunications export task force, which was created by the federal government as part of the government's policy underpinning the reform of the Australian telecommunications industry. The trade mission is a clear example of the continuing growth of the Australian telecommunications industry and the government's commitment to raising the profile of this industry in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to growth in the industry, the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association recently reported that exports of Australian produced telecommunications equipment increased in 1992 by over 25 per cent to $360 million. Exports in 1993 will exceed $500 million, and are on target for $1 billion by 1997. Exports in telecommunications equipment have quadrupled since 1988 and reflect the competitiveness of the industry and the results achievable under the government's telecommunications industry policy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major exports include customer premises equipment; cable, including submarine cable; network equipment; mobile telephones; and data communications equipment. Almost 50 per cent of exports go to the Asian region where the major markets are China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. There are numerous projects in which Australian telecommunication manufacturers are involved. Examples of these projects include the supply by AWA Australia of microwave transmission equipment and multiplexers for Vietnam's rural communication networks; a $70 million contract, won by the Olex Cable division of Pacific Dunlop, involving the supply of 3,150 kilometres of optical fibre cable and transmission equipment that will link a number of cities in north-west China; and a contract for Alcatel Australia, which I mentioned the other day, to supply 12 digital telephone exchanges to China valued at approximately $75 million and considered to be one of the biggest export deals involving exchanges made by an Australian company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, since 1986 Telstra has co-operated with the Director-General of Post and Telecommunications of Vietnam in the development of that nation's telecommunications infrastructure. Under a 10-year business cooperation contract, Telstra's partnership with the DGPT has created satellite earth stations, international and domestic exchanges, optical fibre cabling networks and has supplied a large range of equipment and components, training and management services. A team of over 60 Australian companies has been involved in this project. It is pleasing that the region is increasingly looking to Australia as a supplier of high quality telecommunications equipment and services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does recognise very much the importance to families of affordable and accessible child care so that they can participate actively in the work force and the community. The important child-care initiatives announced by the Prime Minister during the election campaign are designed to build on the government's child-care strategy. First, the government has delivered on places: over its life, the government has increased the number of child-care places from 46,000 to over 200,000 currently and it has increased expenditure from $65 million to about $640 million this financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is moving to implement its election promises, particularly in the area of child care. The government has made a commitment to fully meet the demand for work related child care by the year 2001, and has an interim target of 300,000 child care places by the end of 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget provides funding for an estimated 29,000 additional places in 1993-94. The government will do this by continuing its national child-care strategy and by entering into partnerships with local government, community groups and employers to increase the supply of child care. In case the opposition is interested, New South Wales and Victoria have been very tardy in negotiating with government to establish and continue the national child-care strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also encouraging employers to participate in providing child care by extending the fringe benefits tax exemption not only to cover long day care places that are already covered but also family day care, after school hours care and vacation care from 1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also concerned about the message that has been given to us by users of child care about how best to provide for parents with sick children. This is a pilot project that we established late last year. It has provided evidence to government that will enable us to find the best way of delivering provisions for parents with sick children. This is a very complex measure. Of course, honourable senators would appreciate that the variety of need depends very much on the sort of child care that parents use and whether or not an alternative use of child care might be best for children who are sick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in this area, the National Health and Medical Research Council is investigating the criteria for when children should be required to be away from child care because they may have a contagious or infectious disease and when children who are sick may return to a child-care centre but be cared for apart from the other children. These are very complex matters. The government intends to continue to talk very extensively with child care providers and parent users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also announced its 30 per cent cash rebate for the cost of work related child care, which will be implemented on 1 January 1994. The government is also introducing sales tax exemption for the goods provided in the child care area in long day care, outside school hours care, vacational care and family day care. We are also continuing the important emphasis on quality child care. That is why I have established the National Child Care Accreditation Council, headed by Quentin Bryce, AO, to implement that system. We are also concerned to assist mothers at home by extending long day care fee relief&mdash;now called child assistance&mdash;to occasional care. We have also allocated money to assist the establishment of over 3,000 play groups. So, Mr Deputy President, you can see that in this area the promises made are the promises kept.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To assess this issue, one needs to look a bit at the context. It falls within the context of the overall process of commercialisation the government started in 1987. Since that time, about $700 million in potential revenue previously controlled by what are now Department of the Arts and Administrative Services operations has been opened up to competition. These issues of commercialisation and competition are very complex. They cannot be resolved simply by sloganeering and assertion, which we tend to get all too often.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's obligation is to base decisions in these matters on a proper assessment of the public interest, taking into account the benefit to the public as taxpayers. In the case of Dasfleet, the government has decided that this business should continue as the sole provider of leased self-drive vehicles to Commonwealth departments and agencies. We simultaneously decided that the maintenance and servicing of the leased vehicles should be opened up to private sector competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision was made following a substantial analysis of the options available to the government in this matter. The analysis was first of all undertaken by the Department of Finance in consultation with the Department of Administrative Services but it also involved considerable assistance from expert advisers from the private sector. This analysis showed quite clearly that the current acquisition and leasing arrangements are the most cost-effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of that evidence, not to have gone in the direction that we did&mdash;that is, not to have maintained the current acquisition and leasing arrangements&mdash;would have been a triumph for ideology over analysis. I know that there are those who believe that we should, in any event and irrespective of the facts, proceed to hand things over to the private sector, but in this instance the potential cost to the Commonwealth&mdash;in other words, the Australian taxpayer&mdash;of changing the existing arrangements was assessed at up to $100 million over 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, quite clearly, the responsible decision in this instance was to retain vehicle purchase and disposal through Dasfleet to enable the Commonwealth to maintain the benefits and savings available from its aggregate purchasing power. But something obviously needs to be done to constrain the potential for a monopoly supplier to abuse its position. In the first instance, we will be setting up a committee of the customers to monitor regularly the prices charged and to compare them with private sector charges. There will be a major review conducted under the auspices of that committee in two years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> referred to the fact that some private financing groups have done deals with state governments in this area. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> got it absolutely right when it said that those bodies&mdash;state governments, statutory instrumentalities and local government&mdash;have relied on tax effective financing; that is, they have been transferring the cost to the Commonwealth taxpayer, thus saving money for the state. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> pointed out, while savings from this source have obvious appeal to the states, they have none for the Commonwealth. All we would be doing is making fleet leasing savings in one hand which we paid through forgone tax revenue in the other. We decided not to go in that direction.

I also refer him to taxation law on this matter. Is the minister aware of the Prime Minister's recent statement in Tasmania, of which I have the transcript, that he had hocked his superannuation to pay for his $430,000 half ownership of a $30 million piggery group that has entered into a $80 million joint venture with a Danish multinational?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It concerns the fact that Australia is about to finalise the nuclear science and technology agreement with Indonesia at a time when a decision to construct a new research reactor has been put on hold for five years. If Australia no longer had an operating research reactor, would there be any part of any of the nuclear cooperation agreements already signed or currently being negotiated either in general or with Indonesia in particular which could not be met? Will the minister give the date on which the nuclear science and technology cooperation agreement with Indonesia will be signed? Finally, where will the signing take place?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1047" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is a manifestly hypothetical one, not least because it is the case that Australia continues to operate two research reactors at Lucas Heights&mdash;one medium sized one, the HIFAR, and another very much smaller one&mdash;and will do so for some years to come, irrespective of the question of whether or not the HIFAR reactor is replaced. But having said that, let me respond to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part is based on a false premise about the extent of the obligations that Australia would assume under the agreement with Indonesia, or indeed any similar agreement that might be contemplated. The nuclear science and technology cooperation agreement under discussion with Indonesia is, like most inter-governmental science and technology cooperation agreements, a framework agreement. While setting out the types of areas of intended cooperation, such agreements do not oblige either party to participate in particular projects. That is a matter for subsequent decision on a case by case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have told the Senate on a number of occasions that the agreement in question here is intended to enhance cooperation between Indonesia and Australia in areas such as nuclear medicine, radiation protection, nuclear-related safety information and applications of radioisotopes. Clearly if we did no longer operate any research reactors, the scope for us to engage in nuclear science and technology cooperation with other countries would be significantly diminished. However, I would expect that Australia will remain involved in peaceful uses of nuclear energy into the future, irrespective of whether there is a replacement for HIFAR through, for example, the medical, agricultural and industrial uses of radioisotopes. Similarly, we will be involved in the handling and accounting for nuclear materials for the foreseeable future, again irrespective of the decision on HIFAR.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the latter parts of the honourable senator's question, no date or place for the signature of the agreement has yet been set. As I told the Senate estimates committee on 31 August, the Indonesian Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Habibie, prefers that the agreement be signed in the context of a broader complementary science and technology agreement. Discussions on that are in progress and when precisely all the pieces will come together remains at this stage rather unclear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just take this opportunity to respond to some other related questions that people have been raising in the press recently, in particular about this being a secret agreement with Indonesia. Information in general terms about the nuclear science and technology agreement has been on the public record now for over 18 months. It is not normal practice for draft documents relating to government to government discussion on an agreement under negotiation to be made available publicly. It is simply not appropriate to do so&mdash;not because there is any particular sensitivity about it, but just because of the normal bilateral treaty practice. There is no particular further negotiation going on, in fact, about the text of the nuclear agreement. The difficulty is, as I have just described, that it is being discussed in the context of a possibly broader umbrella science and technology agreement, and how the whole document or related set of documents comes together is yet to be finally determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the agreement is eventually signed, as we hope it will be before too long, it will of course be made public on signature, as these things always are, and tabled in parliament in accordance with normal treaty practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just say finally that I have seen a Greenpeace press release in the last day or so alleging that administrative arrangements for the agreement will not be made public. That is completely off the beam, as Greenpeace press statements so often are. The nuclear science and technology agreement has no administrative arrangements either as part of it or proposed to be part of it. Such arrangements are normal under Australia's nuclear transfer agreements for the export of uranium. But, as I have said on innumerable occasions now, the proposed agreement here does not provide for commercial transfers of uranium. That would be something to be negotiated at some future time, if the case ever arose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it does not. In fact, as I am sure the honourable senator will be well aware, this hypothecation argument in respect of excise and road funding is a fiction, has always been a fiction and will continue to be a fiction, as the history books have shown since federation. Fuel excise is a revenue measure, just like any other revenue measure for government. It is spent not just on roads but on hospitals, health care systems, schools and everything else that the government expends road funding on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the 1991 Premiers Conference, a substantial decision was taken by agreement with all of the state premiers that a brand new arrangement would be set into place in terms of road funding around Australia. It was, in that sense, as many of these things are, an historic decision. It was decided to have an absolute demarcation between the responsibilities of the Commonwealth government and state and local governments in terms of road funding. The Commonwealth government accepted the responsibility for the construction and maintenance of the national highway system, as designated from time to time. All 18,500 kilometres of it would be the Commonwealth's responsibility. The Commonwealth also agreed to untie substantial federal funds that were formerly directed specifically to road projects and to pay those funds to the states as untied grants so that the states, at the discretion of the state cabinets, could determine how that money would be spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister wrote to all of the state premiers and territory chief ministers last year&mdash;I think it was in July&mdash;clearly laying out the responsibilities, as agreed, and the amounts of money that we were committing ourselves to. We have committed ourselves to in excess of $1 billion of federal government funding for roads&mdash;I think the figure is $1.170 billion a year&mdash;for the next three years. Of that, roughly $820 million per year will be allocated by the federal government specifically to the national highway system. The rest of that money will be allocated in terms of untied grants for states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made in recent times&mdash;and it has been highly inaccurate&mdash;of the black spots program, for example, which the federal government initiated through the initiatives of the former Minister for Land Transport, Bob Brown, to his great credit. That program was identified as a one-off program that was always due to expire at the end of June this year. It was a three-year program, planned over three years, and always planned to end in June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The figures that have just been given by Senator Macdonald&mdash;the kind face, the human face, of the Macdonald family in the Senate chamber&mdash;have been used to draw these unreal comparisons against previous base rates of road funding. I will not be deterred if at some future time the Commonwealth can successfully negotiate a further one-off package. But as I have clearly indicated, in historical terms the Commonwealth's commitment to the funding of the Australian road system has been maintained.</PARA>

Dr Kemp just goes around criticising, waiting for reports like this to be tabled and then uses it as a basis to claim the government is not assisting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the Senate and to Dr Kemp&mdash;because he should have read this in the report&mdash;that the tax concession at the moment of 150 per cent for R&amp;D is encouraging companies to spend around $200 million extra on R&amp;D in Australia. Since 1985, that tax concession has meant that there has been $2.2 billion assistance in R&amp;D expenditure in this country. I also draw the attention of Dr Kemp to remarks made by Ian Lowe, a science writer in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Scientist</EMPHASIS>, who said recently in  an article:</PARA>

I think he was referring to a sensational news report on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> around mid-July claiming that I had ignored advice from my Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. That story was absolutely a beat up. It had got the so-called leaked document absolutely confused. The recommendation to me from the department was on an options paper that had been circulated from the Department of Finance that, not only should those two divisions of CSIRO and AIMS be merged, but also the Bureau of Meteorology, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation and a couple of other bodies should all be put into one body. The department recommended that that would be a very unwise combination. I agreed with that. In the same minute, it also said that a more interesting proposal to look at which would have some merit would be the merger that was subsequently discussed and arranged and put out by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I said in that minute that that particular combination interested me and that I would discuss it further with the department, and that is what I did. That story was a complete beat-up and factually wrong. When I discussed it with a journalist a few days later, I pointed out to him that any article in which I am described as a long-term veteran of the Labor Party Left in South Australia is obviously a long way out of the gum tree as far as accuracy is concerned. So it was all downhill after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the proposals put forward to cabinet as part of the budget process I recommended that there be an independent inquiry on the marine issue by Professor McKinnon. In 1989 Professor McKinnon produced a report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oceans of wealth</EMPHASIS>, which has been the best definitive study in the last 15 to 20 years of where we should be going to promote marine and fisheries research in this country. Most of his recommendations and comments are still valid today, if not more valid in view of the fact that Australia is about to declare the exclusive economic zone around our coast, which will be a major resource.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Bishop this day relating to rental of premises by ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that Senator McMullan did not remain in the chamber, because it was quite apparent that the things that passed for answers were totally unsatisfactory and did not answer the main point. The proposed lease for that building is meant to commence on 23 September&mdash;that is, this month&mdash;which is three weeks away. Yet the lease has not yet been signed. That lease needs to be renegotiated to be in accordance with the standards of the Department of Finance. The Department of Finance says that a one per cent increment in the rental is reasonable. The Labor Party is holding the Commonwealth to ransom for nine per cent. The difference is $34 million over 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several points need to be made. Senator McMullan pretended to find evidence that it was a commercial lease. He brought out the Baillieu Knight Frank report, which was released after the event. That report, which is far from supportive of his proposition, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall lease framework is at variance to the general practice of the Commonwealth, in that the Commonwealth generally enters into leases that reflect gross market rents reviewable every two years with the Commonwealth being responsible for increases in statutory outgoings only in addition to normal tenant responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>It further says that it is presumed to be a binding rental and therefore, with respect to the ANAO options, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recommend that relevant advice be sought from the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA>That is hardly a backup for the minister's assertion that it is a commercial lease. As I pointed out, at the time of negotiating this agreement for lease and at the time of signing the agreement for lease, three senators in this chamber were on the board of the company which benefits from the lease. The shareholders are the Australian Labor Party, as set out in the return to the Australian Securities Commission, filed by John Curtin House Ltd, where it says that the Labor Party provides the members of the company. It further says that John Curtin House Ltd has guaranteed, in an unending way, the ALP election fund campaign account and the ALP national secretariat operating account. That is in its 1991 accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its 1992 accounts it omits to mention the ALP election fund, but it does mention the ALP national secretariat operating account, which can fund the campaign fund. So in its own documents it is telling us that the money that is paid by way of the Commonwealth for rent for this building is being used to pay for the Labor Party's election expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It also shows us in the annual accounts that the Labor Party has entered into a mortgage with the Macquarie Bank. The mortgage was entered into on exactly the same day as the agreement for lease was entered into. The size of the mortgage is $50 million. As at 31 December 1992, the Labor Party had already drawn down $14 million against the $50 million. We will see when the accounts are lodged on 31 December 1993 how much of the money was brought down for the building which ranges in value between $17 million and $22 million, and how much was brought down for the guarantee on the Labor Party's campaign fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that this lease has yet to be signed. It is quite clear that this is not a commercial lease. It is tainted by the fact that sitting members of the Labor Party in this Senate are on the board of the company that benefits from this lease. It is a funnel for money from the Commonwealth to the Australian Labor Party. We are talking about $34 million&mdash;the Department of Finance has said that over the course of the lease it will provide $45 million, but the Labor Party will receive $80 million. In other words, the Department of Finance says, `This is a shonky lease'. How can Senator McMullan justify getting the Australian Government Solicitor to sign this lease for and on behalf of the Commonwealth when it is clearly not at arm's length and not a commercial lease, and is designed simply to be a funnel for money to the Australian Labor Party to fund its campaigns? The Labor Party now has access to millions of dollars which do not need disclosure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support my colleague Senator Bishop in her motion to take note of the answer to a question relating to ANAO evidence on rental of premises. Last Thursday, in the estimates committee hearing when this matter was being discussed, evidence was tendered from the Attorney-General's Department that it received advice from the Australian Property Group. That document read as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . APG negotiated the lease clause by clause and achieved amendments which brought the document in line with all significant terms and conditions of the Commonwealth's Standard Expenditure Lease.</PARA>
<PARA>I question whether in fact that is so. There are two very unusual features with regard to this lease which, as my colleague points out, has not been signed yet: first of all, the length of the lease; and, secondly, the escalation clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to length, the advice I have received from the commercial area here in the city is that the Australian Property Group has normally signed leases with a length of 10 years. They sometimes have an option to go another five, but the critical point is that the normal arrangement is 10 years. It is my understanding that one would have to go back a very long way before one would find a 15-year lease, but in this case we have a 15-year lease rather than 10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we have the escalation clause. This agreement was negotiated&mdash;the original agreement was signed in April last year&mdash;at a time when the Australian property market had already crashed substantially throughout the nation. The winds of that change had even reached this city, and its property market was turning down. In spite of that, we have a clause in the agreement for nine per cent per annum for the 15-year period. As my colleague pointed out, that is against what the Department of Finance advised would have been fair and proper&mdash;one per cent&mdash;or what the commercial world would have said, which is that it should have been reviewed every two or three years. Marrying those two things together&mdash;the 15 years and the nine per cent escalation per annum&mdash;we have this extraordinary combination which gives the owner of the property the chance to make substantial gain&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McMullan, in answering Senator Bishop's question, said that previous investigations had found no scandal and no malpractice. Let me state that with the passage of time the leasing of Centenary House, owned by the Labor Party, is fast acquiring a stench of intrigue and corruption. On 7 November 1991, nearly two years ago, at a hearing into the ill-fated Political Broadcasts and Political Disclosures Bill, the then secretary of the ALP, Mr Bob Hogg, was asked whether there were any arrangements for pre-renting of the projected building&mdash;that is, Centenary House&mdash;and the answer he gave was no.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht should just listen. Not until six months later did the audit office know that the building being looked at was owned by the ALP.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Property Group pointed out that the agreement represented `a major departure from the conventional gross lease arrangement', and all details were provided on 1 November 1991. Yet Mr Hogg, the then secretary of the Australian Labor Party, said `no' when asked whether any pre-renting arrangements had been entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 January 1992 I issued a press release exposing this outrageous deal and offered to supply documents supporting my claim. It is fascinating; this is where the stench starts to come in and questions have to be asked. The sorts of questions that have to be asked are: Why did the person in the Australian Property Group who negotiated the agreement take voluntary redundancy within a short period? Why did he ring my office and pretend that he was a private citizen and seek further details on the information that I had? Why did he do that? Is it a fact that the person who negotiated for Lend Lease was previously a director of the Australian Property Group and entered into that detailed negotiation? Is it a fact that the major person in the Australian Valuation Office who had to verify this is a member of the Labor Club and allegedly a member of the Australian Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in his response, quotes Baillieu Knight Frank.

Let me put on the record that the current rental at McEwen House, which I have just checked, is $50 per square metre below the market rate. One of the major complaints we have about this lease agreement is that it is not in accordance with the market and it is not in accordance with the standard practice for government departments leasing buildings from the private sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues on the motion to take note of the answer from Senator McMullan. What we have here is a major scandal&mdash;nothing more, nothing less&mdash;involving taxpayers' funds and in which the government and its officers have been directly involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the facts which have come out today. It is clear, as Senator McMullan said, that this has been debated before, but the Senate estimates committee on 2 September, I suggest to the Senate, brought forth a major new fact; that is, the Department of Finance was exceedingly unhappy with the terms of this lease, a lease which had been negotiated by the Department of Administrative Services. What is new about this debate is that now we have a major government department bringing to the attention of the public that it has very real concerns about this particular contract. Senator Bishop, Senator Parer and a number of my colleagues on this side have been quite right in pointing out these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are these: when this contract is signed it will give a capital profit to the Labor Party of $15 million of taxpayers' money without any real basis for it except that an excessively generous contract has been signed. Above that, over 15 years the Labor Party will collect from the taxpayer some $80 million in rent. What is the profit on that? We would suspect it would be tens of millions of dollars plus a capital profit of $15 million. I put it to the Senate that this is a major scandal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other fact which has been made clear today, and which Senator Bishop has brought to the attention of the chamber, is that this lease has not yet been signed. The actual contract remains for the signatures to be put onto it. I wonder which officers will, in the light of the evidence that has come forth today, be prepared to put their names on such a document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is only one way to deal with this matter; that is, for Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, who allegedly sets the standards of his government, to indicate that in the light of the evidence that has been brought forth by the Department of Finance this contract will be renegotiated and that a fairer rent, a rent far more in line with market rates, will be struck and accepted by the Labor Party. I believe that is what Mr Keating now has to do. I would urge my colleagues, the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine to think very seriously about whether this is not a matter which must be referred to a Senate standing committee for a full and proper investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that this can be avoided by the Prime Minister&mdash;in the light of the evidence which has been brought forth at the Senate estimates committee&mdash;indicating that, in view of the views of the Department of Finance, the government will allow this contract to be renegotiated. I believe that that is the only way that this scandal which is gathering pace and gathering increasing public interest will be laid to rest. If that is not done, it is a matter for this Senate to take action so that this Labor Party will not, once again, rip off the taxpayers of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA>The answer given by the minister was quite misleading; there have been huge changes in Australian air traffic procedures. I say at the outset that the direction of those changes has been quite laudable&mdash;many of them are worth while&mdash;the real criticism is that they have been administered in a terribly incompetent way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, what the Civil Aviation Authority did was to set out to change the Australian air traffic control procedures to the international ICAO standards. One would have no argument about that. The trouble is that the CAA did introduce a number of procedures, like the MTAF and CTAF procedures, which do not exist under the ICAO system. There is a great deal of concern in the aviation community about the changes and the way they have been administered. The big difficulty is that there is not a simple vehicle by which pilots can express their concern to either the CAA or the minister on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very wrong for the minister to hang it all on&mdash;to use his own description&mdash;an idiosyncratic Dick Smith. Mr Smith has taken a leading role in pointing up some of the problems with the air traffic control procedures, but in no sense is he alone in his position. That was just another cheap shot from a master of cheap shots in the form of Senator Collins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say something briefly about the administration of air traffic control procedures. Pilots do things in a predictable way. They learn procedures and they apply them automatically so that everyone does the same thing in a predictable way in all circumstances. Therefore, there is an ingrained reflex pattern of behaviour. If procedures are going to be changed, it follows that there must be a really good educational program to introduce the new practices. That simply has not occurred in all cases. It certainly has occurred in the airlines, which have training schools and training captains. But something like 70 or 80 per cent of the pilots in Australia are private pilots who fly infrequently and do not have the benefit of those training schools. There has been no effective education of those pilots because of the cost-cutting of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once, pilots were taught to always get a weather forecast before they flew cross country. Now they cannot get a weather forecast unless they own a fax machine and have a PIN number. They have to dial in a code. They have to have all the facilities of a sophisticated office to get a weather forecast. When they get it, it is in code and it means nothing to the average person. The other thing that we always taught pilots was to put in a flight plan. Now a flight plan cannot be filed very readily. People are discouraged from doing so. Again, there is a need to have a fax machine and all sorts of elaborate things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the greatest difficulty for the majority of pilots is the fact that the briefing offices have now gone. Once upon a time, if at the weekend I wanted to fly to Rockhampton, for example, and I had not flown for some months, I could go into a briefing office at Archerfield and say, `I'm going up to Rockhampton. What do I need to know about getting into Bundaberg for fuel and into the control zone at Rockhampton?'. In 30 seconds someone would refresh my memory as to what was required. None of those facilities are available for private pilots today. The consequence of all this is that there has been a great reduction in the assurance of air safety in Australia. That is the point that the pilot community is concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not rise to speak about the changes in air traffic procedures but to answer the very unfortunate charge that Senator Collins, in his sneaky way, made about my declaring an interest in aviation. He has made that charge about me twice in this chamber. The first time I let it go. Characteristically, he did it on a broadcast day. The inference was that there is something dishonest about my involvement in aviation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put that on the record straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in aviation is as someone who has been a pilot for 30 years. I have owned, operated and maintained my own aircraft in a purely private capacity for about 25 years. As such, I know far more about the administration of aviation and the huge costs of maladministration than Senator Collins will ever know. I am a user of air services. I do not benefit from them in any way at all. I make a very large financial contribution for the few meagre hours that I am in the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much resent Senator Collins getting up and smearing me by implying that there is something dishonest or underhand in my taking an interest in aviation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Chris Evans this day, relating to recovery of doctors fees.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to deal with the disgraceful failure of the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, to detail many facts in the attack he made&mdash;the quite unfair slander, in effect&mdash;on a decent and honourable Nowra doctor. In particular, I want to contest his allegation that this was a pay or kill proposition. I find it appalling that Senator Richardson should have failed to mention that the client of the doctor had failed to pay his bill for a period of two years. Senator Richardson did not mention this in alleging that the doctor had behaved badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 10 requests for payment of one kind or another that were not responded to by this patient. Yet Senator Richardson was prepared to endorse the fact that Mr Knott, the honourable member for Gilmore, described this doctor as not being a fit and proper person to be a doctor. At least, he certainly did not deny what the honourable member for Gilmore had said and appeared to endorse his remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most important of all, all the patient had to do was to take or post one of the 10 bills he had received for this same service over two years to the Medicare office, get a cheque made out to the doctor and give it to the doctor in satisfaction of the account. He did not have to pay a cracker himself. All he had to do was get off his backside, go to the Medicare office and provide a Medicare&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or post it&mdash;he did not even have to go to the office. This would have been in satisfaction of the account in circumstances where patients have financial problems. This doctor in Nowra&mdash;whom I know because he was my anaesthetist when I had a little problem of a hernia some years ago&mdash;has invariably accepted a Medicare cheque as payment for patients who have approached him and said, `We have financial difficulties in meeting this bill'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, this is what eventually happened. Ten bills and two years after the event, he eventually got off his backside to present a Medicare cheque. Yet here we have Senator Richardson saying that this is a pay or kill situation. This is a disgrace. This patient regarded it as a discretionary bill: if he did not need to pay it, he did not choose to pay it. Frankly, if he does not really need surgery in future&mdash;if it is discretionary&mdash;I would imagine that, surely, the doctor should be entitled to make the offsetting discretionary choice that he is not available unless his bill is paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point is that this patient never, ever sought relief or explained any difficulty either in paying his bill or getting off his backside to get the Medicare rebate cheque and send it to the doctor. There is no suggestion of service not being provided in an emergency. However, the doctor has in fact said that he will rephrase his letter in future to soften the fractured sensibilities of people like Senator Richardson. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's onerous budget decision to increase excise on petrol and diesel leading to greatly increased costs for road and rail transport, harm to Australia's rural and other export industries, substantially increased weekly costs of living for families and the continuing reduction of excise spent on roads.</PARA>
<PARA>I have moved this urgency motion on the last day of the sitting fortnight because I believe this is one of the most important issues facing Australia. In his budget speech, the Treasurer, John Dawkins, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary objective of this budget is jobs: jobs in the short term by providing a further fiscal stimulus to the economy this year&mdash;to sustain Australia's economic growth until the motor of world recovery kicks in. And jobs in the medium and longer term by boosting the capacity of Australian business to expand production on a world-competitive basis.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the rock which the budget was built upon. That budget included an increase in excise of $1.2 billion; it added $175 million a year in excise to the road transport scheme and $20 million to the rail scheme. That will have a tremendous impact on the lack of jobs, with no jobs coming through, as the increased cost of fuel bites into our export commodities and our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were in government, the transport industry would now be $2.2 billion better off. That would be the benefit to the transport industry. The $2.2 billion is made up of the removal of the excise and the removal of sales tax from the purchase price of transport such as prime movers and trailers, as well as spare parts, batteries and tyres. Overall, the industry would be better off by $2.4 billion a year. Instead of that, we get a 19 per cent increase in excise rates of up to 29c a litre. That is no way to encourage jobs or growth. It is the absolute direct opposite of what the government has said and what it has based its budget upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in excise will impact heavily on primary industry in the more remote states. Senator Collins, in answer to a question that I asked him the other day, admitted that the increased cost on transport would be between 2.5 per cent and five per cent. That would be an average increase around Australia. The increase could be higher than that for the more remote areas. It has been estimated that the extra cost amounts to about $3 per week on a trolley of groceries. For the remote states like the Northern Territory, which Senator Collins represents, and Western Australia, represented by the two Green senators, the increase will be about 25 per cent. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase in excise will totally depend on the reaction that the Greens from Western Australia and Senator Harradine have. I do not know how Senator Harradine will respond; I have not discussed it with him. In normal circumstances, Senator Harradine will stand up very firmly for the State of Tasmania. This increase in excise will be determined by the actions taken by the Green senators. If they support the government's budget, they will be inflicting a heavier cost on their electors in Western Australia who will pay a higher proportion of road transport costs on the products that they receive into Western Australia and on the exports that they transfer to the east of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the points which the Greens must now consider. The Democrats have backed this budget and they are going to support the government's increase of $175 million a year on the diesel fuel excise and another $100 million a year on sales tax. The cost to the average road owner operator will increase by $6,000 for diesel fuel and by $4,000 in extra sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy-five per cent of all freight is moved nationally by road. The road transport industry employs 177,000 people and road transport is used at every stage&mdash;from the farm to the supermarket. It is really the only mode of transport that takes goods from the farm gate. The goods may then go by rail but are then transferred to another road operator into the factory or wherever. The recession has increased competition and has reduced road transport's average profit margin by between four and two per cent. The short haul sector will have to increase its rates by up to three or four per cent and the long haul sector will have to increase its rates by something like five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's increased costs cannot be absorbed by the industry. Freight rates will have to be increased. The road transport industry will have to take cost cutting measures on board. That will affect the environment, safety, and employment; all the social impacts will be there. The climate is not right for freight cuts. We will have to increase the cost of freight and that will have an impact on our $60 billion worth of exports. Agriculture earns $17.4 billion; mining earns $20.1 billion; and the manufacturing sector earns $17.6 billion; and they are all large users of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Labor Party and the Labor government do not understand what competition is about. We have to be out there competing in world markets. We have heard ad nauseam from the various ministers of the government how we have to become internationally competitive and how we have to meet competition in world markets. But I continually say that it is so difficult when the government keeps increasing the costs to our rural exporters, our primary industry and our mining industries, and now it is increasing costs to the 700 small businesses that have broken through the market and are exporting. </PARA>
<PARA>When the government keeps increasing costs, it almost reaches the stage of impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to compare taxes in Australia with those in the United States. In Australia the government charges on fuel are 17c per litre; in the US they are only 4c per litre; and in Canada they are 12c per litre. For long haul trucks, US government taxes are only 10c a litre; they are 17c a litre in Canada. But in Australia the tax amounts to 27c a kilometre. That makes us terribly inefficient and anti-competitive. When the order book comes around to be filled, it puts Australia in a position where we find it so much more difficult to compete and therefore we lose market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons we have one million unemployed is that government charges&mdash;this is only one aspect of government charges but a very significant one&mdash;exact $1.2 billion in excise from our overseas exporters and primary industry.

I might not always agree with them but he certainly raises them. The other day he raised the issue of the newsagency arrangements in Queensland&mdash;a very reasonable issue. I always listen to Senator Boswell's remarks, particularly those relating to small business. However, this motion is not about small business; it is about a political activity in this chamber to create public debate on the present budget. Therefore, I do not think I can give it the same credibility as a small business issue since it is part of a political campaign by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find interesting about Senator Boswell's motion which seeks to condemn the government's onerous budget decision to increase excise on petrol and diesel, et cetera, is that in 1979-80 the coalition brought about the biggest increase in excise on petrol in Australia when it decided to go to world parity pricing. That was the biggest increase in petrol prices for the consumer, whether they be domestic or applying to industry, in Australia's history. Some people may say that there were rational economic reasons why that decision had to be taken to go to world parity pricing, but it amounted to the biggest cost increase on the transport industry in living memory. The coalition took that decision. I would have liked to have seen some comment in Senator Boswell's speech today about how that fitted into the picture and hurt the transport industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell talked about international competitiveness. Even with these increases announced in the budget, I would point out that Australia had the third lowest petrol prices of the OECD countries before the budget. We still have the cheapest petrol of our major competitors in the marketplace. So even with these increases, in terms of international competitiveness we are still maintaining our advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to point out to the opposition that in 1981-82 excise revenue was 14.6 per cent of total Commonwealth revenue. In 1992-93 that figure declined to 10 per cent of Commonwealth revenue. So even with this increase, there has been a substantial decline in excise in Australia as a proportion of the tax revenue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that shortly Senator Crane will blame the trade unions for this increase. The usual line that we hear from him is that it is all the fault of the trade unions&mdash;it is Bill Kelty's fault or the fault of someone else in the trade union movement. He will soon bring into the argument that it is the fault of the BLF or something on those lines. To Senator Crane every issue in this place is a conspiracy by the trade union movement. I do not know whether he is speaking in this debate, but if he does take part I would bet my last dollar, or even the last litre of petrol in my tank, that he would be blaming the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell, using some colourful language, said that these increases will mean the end of Australian industry. He did not claim that they would lead to the end of motherhood and christianity, but he nearly went as close as saying that. If it is a political plug that Senator Boswell wants to make&mdash;we all accept in this place that from time to time we are all guilty of gilding the lily to sell our political statement&mdash;I would point out that in regard to the impact on the CPI, the initial 3c per litre increase in excise will add around one-fifth of a percentage point to that index. When all the excise increases have been phased in, the total impact on the CPI will be around one-half of a percentage point. That is a very modest increase on the CPI over a number of years. It is nothing compared to the increase in the CPI caused by the former coalition government in 1979-80 when it went to world parity pricing. There was a much bigger increase at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the whole period of this government, the average inflation rate has always been below the average inflation rate of the Fraser government. One of the reasons is that within a year the coalition jacked up world parity for everybody in Australia. The coalition should not bleat in this chamber about its concern for the impact on the transport industry. In 1979-80 the coalition gave it the biggest hit in the back of the head that it has had in the postwar period by going to world parity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by commenting on the general political context of this motion. We are now seeing in the Senate an attempt by the opposition to recover from the extraordinary tactical mistake made by Dr Hewson the day after the budget when he said, `We will oppose carte blanche every tax increase and every tax revenue measure in the budget'. That was the biggest tactical mistake that the opposition dealt itself from the pack of cards. It took away any bargaining position. Much to its angst now, all the opposition did was pass the bargaining chip down to where the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine sit. They received the bargaining chip and the ability to say, `We'll discuss this with the government', because they knew that the opposition was implacably opposed. Dr Hewson again showed abysmal political perspicacity by saying carte blanche, `We oppose everything'. The opposition was out the back door, out of the loop in terms of having any influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the coalition continues to take that role, all it will do is make the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine very thankful for the coalition's political stupidity. That is what those opposite have done. This motion is an attempt to pull a political stunt in here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson, with all his stupid political acumen&mdash;and it is stupid&mdash;helps us every time. Come the next election, with Dr Hewson as Leader of the Opposition, we will have a great chance of winning. He gave us the election victory last time because of his stupidity and lack of political skill, and is at it again. The real problem for Dr Hewson is not only his own lack of political skill but the lack of political skill in the rest of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said in a debate a week or so ago that for the first time in the history of this parliament, in nearly 93 years, no opposition member in the Senate from a non-Labor Party has had ministerial experience. For the whole history of federation there has always been someone opposite who has had ministerial experience, even when in opposition. There have been people who have had previous ministerial experience who know about the parameters and responsibility of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No current members of the opposition in the Senate have any ministerial experience. As a result they have become the permanent opposition and have an oppositionist mentality. We in the Labor Party know what it is like because we were in that position in the 1950s and 1960s. But we now understand the responsibility of government. Those opposite have slipped into the disease of the Labor Party of the 1950s and 1960s&mdash;permanent opposition. The decision they took to oppose all the revenue measures in the budget indicates that, and they will pay a big penalty for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is rather interesting that the opposition invokes the workings of the market so much in debate and in its rhetoric, and yet when we are dealing with a question that pre-eminently concerns the user pays principle&mdash;the underpinnings by which the market gives the correct price signals to those who consume goods and services&mdash;those opposite jump up and down and complain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half the world's leading Nobel prize winning scientists have said that we face an urgent problem with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. Australia is one of the worst polluters in the world with respect to greenhouse gases on a per capita basis. The use of motor vehicle fuels on the road probably costs roughly $1,000 at least per motor vehicle in deaths and accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the problem of lead in children&mdash;a problem which has been raised particularly in recent days but which has been around for 20 years. Some statistics suggest that 44 per cent of children in the under-four age group may be suffering some mental impairment because of lead in petrol. These are all significant costs on the community which are directly related to the use of petroleum and are clearly not being represented in the price structure of petroleum. Therefore, they represent distortions in the market. People are not getting the right price signals and they are not making the right judgments regarding the use of fuel. Therefore, they are causing these things to be imposed on their fellow citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, I point out that in our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting to Work</EMPHASIS> document, which we launched in July last year, we set out a much better alternative to what the government has proposed. This afternoon we are not debating our budget, but the government's budget&mdash;a budget that has been moderately amended through a process of consultation and negotiation. It is not our preferred budget, but it does go some way towards addressing this problem of putting in the right price signals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are still two basic problems with what the government is doing, and to that extent we agree with the motion. First is the issue of equity, particularly in respect of country people. Undoubtedly, this increase in price, which the government has modified to some extent, still impacts adversely on country people. My colleague Senator Woodley will address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, because this increase in price is going into general revenue,  my primary concern is that it is not being used to address those very significant problems that I alluded to earlier. I refer to the problem of greenhouse gases, looking to ways of addressing the excessive use of fuel in this country and the development of alternative fuels, increased expenditure in areas, such as rail transport and so on, which would address that problem, and solutions to the problem of getting the lead out of petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently Senator Schacht answered a supplementary question of mine in which he said that by the year 2002 lead would go out of petrol simply because there would be so few cars using lead in petrol that it would be uneconomic to the petrol companies to market leaded petrol. He admitted that the government's lead strategy is simply falling into line with the petrol companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that there is a solution to this problem, which is to use alcohol as a supplement to petrol. That would allow us within a period of two years to get lead out of petrol and make a fuel alternative available to those people who continue to drive cars needing octane enhanced fuel. </PARA>

The minister has said that, compared with 24 OECD countries, Australia has the third lowest priced petrol and the second lowest rate of excise. We are one of the worse polluters when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions and we have one of the highest levels of lead in our fuel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with pleasure to support the urgency motion moved by my colleague from Queensland Senator Boswell. It relates to the increase in the diesel fuel levy. While the debate about the increase in wine tax has been raging around Australia since the budget was brought down&mdash;and I believe that debate should have raged&mdash;the massive increase in the diesel fuel levy has been somewhat neglected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the wine tax amounted to $70 million in 1993-94 and $95 million in a full year. But the diesel fuel intake is $441 million, which is an increase of 16.7 per cent. Added to that is the $100 million for the administration of the rebate scheme&mdash;I will come back to that later&mdash;less the $95 million increase in the overall rebate. On a quick calculation, it appears that the government will take at least $350 million to $360 million out of the diesel fuel rebate around Australia in one financial year. This adds a massive burden to the transport industry and to primary industry. Those like me, who live in rural and remote areas of Australia, will understand that. No matter what we do, diesel fuel impinges on every aspect of life. A third of the cars these days&mdash;that figure might be a bit high; perhaps it is 15 to 20 per cent&mdash;run on diesel fuel. All four-wheel-drive vehicles run on diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one could dodge paying the increase in sales tax on wine. I have no trouble in dodging the increase in sales tax on wine because I do not drink wine at all. For those people who drink wine and want to dodge the tax increase, the solution is to either reduce their intake or cut it out entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in relation to diesel fuel is totally different. If we want Australia to keep moving&mdash;Australia moves on its transport and is financed by rural and mining production&mdash;we have to have diesel and we have to pay the increases. A publication I have from the Road Transport Forum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional excessive taxes are proposed for people consuming items transported by road in the 1993/94 Commonwealth Budget. These increases involve</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*an additional 5c per litre on diesel (or 19% on the existing rate of 26.73c per litre) implemented through</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.an extra 3c per litre from 17 August 1993</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.an extra 1c per litre from August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>The effects of these increases will mean an increase of $2 to $3 a week for a basket of simple household shopping items. I presume that most housewives these days cannot afford to stock the house for the whole week, so they go shopping probably twice a week. This is the sort of increase they will have to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road transport industry in Australia is a very important one and the government in the past has recognised this fact and has made certain arrangements. The publication I referred to earlier also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This fact was recognised by the Federal Government when it established the National Road Transport Commission to reform road charges and regulations to improve road transport safety and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Transport &amp; storage sector in Australia contributes 5 percent share of Australia's Gross Domestic Product and employs over 385,000 people directly. Road transport . . . alone contributing 2.4 percent of the national GDP. In comparison with other modes of freight transport, road transport:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*moves 75 per cent of freight nationally (990 million tonnes)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*directly employs over 177,000 people, or 49% of transport employment</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*contributes $6 billion of Gross Product (45% of transport).</PARA>
<PARA>Having gained some efficiencies in the measures that were brought in in the last parliament, the government is going to wipe them out by the addition of these extra fuel taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor borne out in this publication is the impact of the increases to the diesel excise and wholesale sales tax on vehicle operating costs. The figures relate to cents in the dollar. Fuel taxes and levies alone would increase long distance operations of transporters by 18.4 per cent and on the short haul, which includes the urban situation, by 13.7 per cent. There is to be an increase of $2 to $3 a week in the shopping basket of families. There will be an increase of roughly $5,000 to $6,000 to road transporters per unit they operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we come to rural sector in which I am vitally interested. It has not escaped because this budget takes from it a fair slice of the off-road component&mdash;the return will not be as much. Transport, especially in the grain industry, is the biggest single item cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government brought in a $100 million administration fee to administer the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The diesel fuel rebate was brought in in 1957. I contradict Senator Schacht because at an estimates committee he told us that the diesel fuel rebate was an aid to industry. It is not. It was brought in 1957 to pay back to off-road users the excise they paid on fuel used off-road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of the day decided that road transport operators would pay their fair share of road maintenance. I quote very briefly from a speech which a former minister, Mr Osborne, made in this parliament in 1957. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable members will no doubt recall the introduction in this House on 3rd September this year of Customs Tariff Proposal No. 5 and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 1 which, amongst other matters, gave effect to the Government's decision to impose a duty of one shilling a gallon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which I presume is 10c a gallon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on imported and Australian diesel fuel of the type used in diesel-engined road vehicles. The object of the tax was to ensure that operators of diesel-powered vehicles made a reasonable contribution to road construction and maintenance, as is the case with petrol-driven engines.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has forgotten to put that money back into roads. Mr Osborne continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was necessary to impose the duty on all automotive-type diesel fuel irrespective of the purpose for which it would be used but that reimbursement to the extent of one shilling a gallon would be made to those persons who used this type of fuel other than in the operation of road vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So Senator Schacht should take note that it is not an aid to industry; it is simply giving farmers and other off-road operators back what the government has taken from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know any other government tax that has been introduced as an administration charge.

Let me cite some figures from the farm facts lifestyle survey. The average private distance travelled by farm families is 31,270 kilometres a year, compared with 19,240 kilometres a year for a capital city family. One can see the significant difference.

Tourism to remote places in states like South Australia and Western Australia, where there are no air services, will be especially hard hit. I am sure Senator McKiernan is very pleased to know what sort of effect it will have on tourism in Western Australia.

The Treasurer says that it is not a tax on the necessities of life, but it is a tax on every household item that we have. It will cost more to transport household items and non-food groceries to country towns. But they will go up in price anyway because of the increase in the wholesale sales tax. It will also cost more for people to drive to major centres to buy items that are not readily available in the country. Such items are becoming even less readily available because of the economic hardships being suffered in rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, fuel tax is a tax on food. It costs more to transport food to regional, rural and remote areas. It costs more to buy food because it will cost farmers more to produce food. I have already been contacted by a beekeeper who lives in a remote part of Kangaroo Island and who will be putting up the price of a simple thing such as honey as a direct result of the fuel tax increase and the extra costs that he will have to bear. So the Treasurer should not say that fuel tax is not a tax on the necessities of life, because it is.

Fuel tax is the consumption tax that one has when one is not having a consumption tax. It impacts on everything.

Rural and regional areas have never been in so much trouble economically. What is this government's response? Slug them a bit more; squeeze the last drop out of the lemon.

I am not saying that just because I am a Labor Party government senator, because it has happened previously&mdash;a long time ago when those opposite were in government and introduced budgetary measures which increased taxes and increased revenue and which were opposed by the then opposition.

I do not enjoy paying tax out of my income which is stopped before I even get the money into the bank account. I do not enjoy paying tax on the fuel that we purchase from the petrol pumps.

In my state of Western Australia we know this as much as anybody else, although perhaps the Victorians are hurting a bit more on the state side of things. But governments do raise revenue through a variety of measures which include taxation and excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the fuel excise that we are debating this afternoon will undoubtedly hurt the community. Those who buy petrol or diesel at the moment will pay, or are paying currently, more for those products. The government realised this when it took those measures; it took it into account. They are very considered measures and it was known that they would have an inflationary impact on our society. Not only does one have to take account of the cost of the actual product that one purchases and puts into the fuel tank of the vehicle one is using; there is also the spin-off effect in that it will be inflationary.

To raise revenue by increasing taxes on fuel is not a new phenomenon. In 1981-82 the government of the day raised 14.6 per cent of the total Commonwealth revenue from excise on fuel. In 1992-93&mdash;the last complete year for which statistics are available&mdash;we brought that down to 10 per cent. So fuel is actually cheaper than it was more than 10 years ago when those opposite were in office&mdash;or when their predecessors were because none of this lot has ever served on the front bench; they do not have an `honourable' among them!

I point out that the previous Queensland government had a very low tax base, even to the point that it left the chest full for the incoming government. Even last week, the Queensland government did not put up taxes because it can rely on what was left from the previous government.

<PARA>I will start off in a way that these sorts of speeches often end, and that is to thank the secretariat who prepared this report. The report has just got to us after some quite desperate work from Elton Humphery and Winifred Jurcevic who did all the typing. They deserve to be thanked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Select Committee on Matters Arising from Pay Television Tendering Processes has a few terms of reference, one of which is the subject of this report&mdash;and there is another report to follow. Part (1)(a) of the terms of reference states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Matters Arising from Pay Television Tendering Processes be appointed to inquire into and report upon the following matters:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the version of facts which he accepted he acted reasonably and in the circumstances prevailing at the time was reasonable in accepting this version.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is now aware of deficiencies in his department at the relevant time and of the need to remedy them.

<PARA>The conclusion reached is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and the point of the phrase `to date' is that the committee has yet to consider other parts of the terms of reference&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Minister for Transport and Communications has discharged his ministerial responsibilities in relation to satellite and MDS tender processes.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee reserves judgment on the Minister's discharge of those responsibilities requiring action to be taken to rectify the administrative deficiencies until after it completes the second part of its inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>That will be an inquiry into what has been done to rectify problems in the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston and Senator Tierney put in a dissenting report to the findings and conclusions reached by the majority of committee members. I am sure that both honourable senators will speak to the report and point out why they dissented. The dissenting report contains the following quote from Winston Churchill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not know. I was not told. I should have asked.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee as a whole would agree with that quote, but it does not apply in the present situation. The minister did not know all the facts that were relevant. He was not told. But, in the view of the majority, the proposition that he should have asked is not a valid criticism. In the circumstances at the time, he was informed of certain issues, but not all of them. The way he acted, as I have already said, was reasonable in all the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition that people should not be punished for acting other than they might have acted if they had known the full facts, having acted in the light of the facts as they understood them, is a concept that runs very deeply in our law. That is borne out by a statement from one of the greatest, if not the greatest, common lawyers in the history of the common law world, Mr Justice Dixon, as he was during the case I will quote from. He later became a very eminent chief justice for the High Court. In this case, Proudman and Dayman, he was talking in circumstances quite different from the present one; nevertheless, the statement he made is relevant to it. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a general rule, an honest and reasonable belief in a state of facts which if they existed would make the defendant's act innocent affords an excuse for doing what would otherwise be an offence.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, this is not completely relevant to the present circumstances, because what he was talking about then was an offence under the Road Traffic Act of South Australia. But what about the proposition that we cannot hold people responsible for acting on an honestly held and properly ascertained view of the facts simply because those facts are wrong?  The minister was not reckless in accepting the facts as he saw them. He honestly believed those to be the true facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston and Senator Tierney do not accept that proposition. No doubt they will both argue very strenuously that their proposition is correct. They will say, no doubt, that the facts as I have outlined them are wrong and the facts as they will outline them are correct. It is a matter for the people who are listening to this debate to make up their own minds as to where the truth lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view of the majority was formed on the basis of facts very similar to those found by Professor Pearce. There are four senators responsible for the majority report, three of whom are government senators, who are no doubt keen, and whose minds might be considered biased in favour of the minister, a person who has been in caucus with them for a long while. It is understandable that those people&mdash;Senator McKiernan, Senator Loosley and I&mdash;may be biased because of the situation we find ourselves in. That is a proposition that no doubt will be put forward by Senator Alston and Senator Tierney. But then, of course, we are supported by Senator Bourne, who, I venture to say, would be considered one of the most fair-minded senators presently in this chamber&mdash;and, I think, one of the most fair-minded senators who have ever been in this chamber. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that she is in this political atmosphere and perhaps could have been overborne by the vigour of the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we come to Professor Pearce, who went away and made the report divorced from political considerations; a person who was absolutely independent of all this. That is the problem that Senator Alston and Senator Tierney face. They know that they can get up and say that the three government senators may be prejudiced. They have a lot more trouble with Senator Bourne. But their real problem is Professor Pearce. That is why in their dissenting report the attack is not on the senators but on Professor Pearce. That is the exercise they have engaged in. They might be right, but let us have a look. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opinion of the majority, as expressed in the majority report, is couched in very measured terms. It is my proposition that it is consistent with a measured consideration of this case. If we look at the dissenting report, we see phrases such as `this advice was extraordinary'. They are talking about an advice that they had dealt with earlier in their opinion. On the same page, we see these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is extraordinary that at no stage did he apparently turn his mind to how Cabinet's request could be facilitated. Indeed he seems to have been blissfully unaware. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Over the page, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also extraordinary that there appear to be no minutes of the meetings</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances it beggars belief that Professor Pearce. . .</PARA>
<PARA>On the same page, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also verging on the unbelievable. . .</PARA>
<PARA>We can see the following phrase:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is not able to be presently located is also highly convenient. . .</PARA>
<PARA>On the same page, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these events are true then they suggest that the Minister's office was indeed a shambles. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Over the page, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pearce&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not `Professor Pearce'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">simply notes that there were no discussions with the Minister or his advisers relating to the tender process to be included in the determination. He makes no adverse comment on what is obviously a deficiency in the chain of reporting and accepts the Minister's specious proposition</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pearce seems oblivious to the fact that intervention to require a deposit could not in any circumstances be construed as favouritism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings of Professor Pearce in relation to term of reference number 4 are a complete whitewash.</PARA>
<PARA>On the bottom of the page, the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Collins cannot possibly be excused for treating this as just another document. To the extent that he was unaware of its significance he was guilty of a gross failure to exercise reasonable care. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Are those sorts of terms consistent with a considered statement of what happened in relation to the two tender processes? These are the words that Senator Alston and Senator Tierney use in putting a proposition that is contrary to the findings of four senators and of Professor Pearce. Senator Alston and Senator Tierney are good members of the Liberal Party and do the best they can for their party, and certainly it would be of advantage to the Liberal and National Party coalition if Senator Collins were brought down. It may just be that that matter affected their minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another issue in the context of what happened during this inquiry. At a committee hearing in Canberra on 20 August this year Senator Alston and Senator Tierney made the very reasonable request that a Mr Bruce Meagher be called before the committee. Mr Bruce Meagher was a person who could have given evidence relevant to the matter we had before us. At the time he was a member of Minister Collins's staff. As chairperson, I asked Senator Collins whether he would object to Mr Meagher being called. Senator Collins said he would object on the basis that Mr Meagher, as a member of the minister's personal staff, should not be called and that it was a bad precedent to set. In fact, it would have been a precedent because there is no evidence that this has ever been done before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As chairperson I ruled in favour of Senator Collins. I said that of course there is a public interest in having all facts before the committee and that any witness that might be able to throw light on those facts would be quite valuable. But I said there is also a public interest in not calling members of a parliamentarian's personal staff or a minister's personal staff because it was likely that it would be prejudicial to the confidentiality which as parliamentarians we all come to rely on when we are getting advice from our personal staff or from our personal advisers. I felt it would be a bad thing to prejudice that confidentiality. I am still of that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that precedent is set, the House of Representatives could call on the personal staff of the Leader of the Opposition, or it could call on the personal staff of every shadow minister, and indeed of every member of the opposition, and ask that person to give an account. If it were taken too far, parliamentarians could call on members of the press to disgorge what their sources had told them in confidence. The whole concept of confidentiality would be prejudiced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am asked,`Did he talk to Pearce in confidence?' He did. That is one factor that might be taken into account in deciding whether or not to call him. He had spoken to Professor Pearce and there was no suggestion that what he told Professor Pearce was wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that I ruled against Senator Alston and Senator Tierney, who objected strongly, and properly so. I thought about what Senator Alston, who is a very experienced person in the procedures of this place, a person who once adorned the legal profession, would do. I thought he would go to the Senate and say, `Look at this outrageous piece of conduct on Senator Cooney's part. I want the Senate to order'&mdash;as it could&mdash;`that Senator Collins's personal adviser, Mr Meagher, appear before this committee and give evidence'. But Senator Alston did not do that; he has not moved. One can legitimately wonder how interested he really was in calling this person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This happened on 20 August and there have been several sitting days since then. There has been no motion from Senator Alston. He has not come in here and said, `I am going to move a motion, which I will get through here tomorrow, that Mr Meagher be called before this committee'. He could have done that but he did not. Instead, what he did&mdash;and this indicates what he was really on about&mdash;was put out a press release on the same day that this happened. The press release is headed, `Looks like a cover-up, smells like a cover-up'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three Government members today bludgeoned through the Senate Pay TV inquiry an unprecedented resolution refusing to allow a key witness to appear before the committee for questioning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discharging Mr Meagher from this responsibility is unprecedented and has the hallmarks of a crisis management exercise. It is nothing more than a government cover-up.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would have been the first political staffer to appear before a Senate inquiry, there is nothing stopping him from doing so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few points I want to make about the general proposition of ministerial responsibility. We found that ministerial responsibility is really a hard concept to define because, if I can just go back to my days in law, it is a bit like the defence of provocation in murder. Even if one reads all the books, it is very hard to explain the concept of provocation because one really has to look at the situation where that woman was provoked into killing that man or vice versa or whatever. We really cannot define it because we have to look at the particular circumstances. It is the same with the concept of ministerial responsibility: we have to look at it and say, `In all the circumstances, this person has gone a bit beyond the pale'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether a minister stays or goes depends upon the leader. It could be said that that is a cynical approach. But it is a realistic approach and it is not a cynical approach because the pressure is on the leader, as we said in the report, to rely on his or her own sense of morality. The political ethics within which he works, parliamentary pressure, peer pressure, party sentiment, community standards, community reactions, media reaction and precedent all play a part in bringing moral imperatives into the equation. But it is wrong&mdash;and I would like to hear Senator Alston comment on this&mdash;to show too great a tendency to treat the concept as some sort of legal concept and say, `We have all these existing and specific laws and we find out facts. Then we join the two together and apply the principles of natural justice to get a decision'. It is not like that at all; it is a political process with a lot of elements to be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 64 of the constitution makes it clear that it is very much the Prime Minister who decides what happens. Section 64 of the constitution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish.</PARA>
<PARA>Since the Governor-General acts&mdash;or should act&mdash;on the advice of the Prime Minister in this case, it is the Prime Minister who decides. That is not to say that parliament is excluded from considerations in cases such as this; in fact, it is included in such considerations. In this report we used the expression `accountability to parliament' when referring to the responsibility of the Prime Minister. There is nothing that can stop parliament bringing a minister to account, as was done in the case of Senator Collins. He was questioned in here, he was subjected to issues raised in debate about him, and so on. That is the good, vigorous part of what goes on in the political world, and it will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the concept of ministerial responsibility and responsibility to the Prime Minister. He or she alone can make the person resign, or else dismiss, demote or not promote him or her at a later stage. On the other hand, Parliament, through the various proceedings available to it&mdash;which are so well exercised&mdash;can do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, we worked out some tests which may be applied in a case such as this. On those tests the majority concluded that Senator Collins had not breached his ministerial responsibility. Having said that and having applied those tests&mdash;I did not know, I was not told, I should have asked&mdash;to Senator Collins, we concluded that in our view Winston Churchill would have come to the same conclusion as we did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real argument in this case is the interpretation of facts and the facts that are relied upon. We simply say&mdash;and I end on this note because I think it is the important issue in this matter&mdash;that our findings of fact are consistent with those of the independent fact finder, Professor Pearce, a man well respected in all areas, and therefore better deserve to be relied upon than the findings and interpretations of two other people who, no matter how wonderful they are, are nevertheless properly members of a political party and are advocating a position which their political party would no doubt want them to advocate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to go back to Senator Collins who, in his usual smart alec way, said that as far as he was concerned one only ever resigned if one lost the confidence of the Prime Minister, and I think he then added `and a few of his close mates'. That fundamentally misunderstands what the doctrine of ministerial responsibility ought to be about. It might be stating the application of the rule as far as the Labor Party is concerned. In other words, if one has no moral compass, if one thinks one can tough it out and is basically like the New South Wales Right&mdash;a collection of spivs on the make&mdash;and one does not have any moral values to guide one, then of course one's judgments are determined by things such as public opinion polls, editorials and the extent of community outrage. At some stage one says, `It is getting a bit hot in this kitchen; we are coming up to an election; we had better cut this bloke loose'. That is the sort of morality that operates on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I was a bit disappointed that someone of Senator Cooney's high moral standards would not recognise that this ought to be a debate about what is to be expected of figures in public life, not what they do in practice when they happen to be part and parcel of a caucus and attached to the moorings of the current Prime Minister who never ever seemed to recognise the concept of morality in public life. That is where I think the majority has been fundamentally misled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not here to say that this is simply a collection of biases on one side or the other, or a strict exchange of prejudices, if you like. It is more a matter of trying to analyse the findings and decisions that have been made. Page 10 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rules of natural justice do not apply to leaders' decisions to have ministers dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA>The government just does not understand the concept of natural justice. Natural justice is the right to be tried and heard by a tribunal free of bias. Even by the very murky standards of those opposite, I would have thought that a minister in their government ought to be entitled to have his case properly considered by the Prime Minister of the day and for that Prime Minister to then make a decision free of bias against the minister. Surely that is a reasonable proposition. Yet Senator Cooney seems to think that somehow rules of natural justice do not apply to leaders' decisions. Maybe they do not in practice, but they certainly should. Government members confused the normative and the positive constantly throughout this report. That is where they simply go astray from the outset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we try to identify standards of behaviour and then judge whether people measure up to those standards, we do not even begin to deal with what ministerial responsibility is all about. If we take Senator Cooney's approach, it is simply a matter of what one can get away with in terms of public outrage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, we can go to the report's conclusions. I would have thought that Senator Cooney would be very conscious of the difference between actual and constructive knowledge. Yet what we have under the heading `Findings' is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In both tendering processes the Minister may have taken action different to that which was actually taken had he appreciated the full and accurate facts relevant to each. However he was not aware of them and proceeded in both cases on a version of facts which in vital circumstances was incomplete and inaccurate.</PARA>
<PARA>The obvious question is whether he ought to have known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall&mdash;Senator Cooney might also remember this&mdash;the old days where in company law there was a case of a company director who was charged with negligence because of all sorts of heinous things that had gone on over a period of years. It was not Foss v Harbottle. In any event, his defence was, `You cannot blame me. I have not been to a board meeting in 32 years'. Does Senator Cooney remember that one?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He got off; that is my point. One could not do that these days. One cannot say, `I am the minister, but no-one told me about this, so I wash my hands of it. I was in Darwin in January watching the cricket, and I was getting ready for the election. Because the department did not ring me and the ministerial staff were out to lunch, that is not my fault'. That is not what constructive responsibility is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an obligation on a minister to keep himself fully informed, to ensure that he has competent people around him, to seek advice where it is necessary and to heed it when it is given. What happened in this case? This minister has not been in the job five minutes. In fact, even by January this year he had been in the job longer than his three predecessors combined. But certainly he was not a Johnny-come-lately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins might have been a failed opposition leader in the Northern Territory, but he has been in politics for a considerable number of years. He knows the game backwards. He is quite proud of the fact that he was a gutter politician in the territory, because he has told us so in the chamber. By this stage, he was not only in his first ministerial portfolio but in cabinet. Therefore, one would have expected someone in that position to be acutely aware of the need to ensure that cabinet decisions are carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened at the time? Senator Richardson was wandering around the world in March last year. He got informed, as he should have, about tendering processes and the change of approaches taken by regulators. He came back with the considered view that beauty contests are not really on these days and that one needs to have some sort of pre-qualification process but essentially a price based allocation system. That all made a lot of sense. Senator Richardson took it on board and then got the chop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who should then come along but Senator Collins. The first thing that Senator Collins should have done was inform himself about current practices and where things were in terms of tender processes. He well knew, as he has conceded, of the AM-FM conversion fiasco. Therefore, this had to be a top-of-the-mind issue. Indeed, he was going into a brand new era of regulation. He was going into a system that was clearly going to be quite different from that which had preceded it. He was going into it for both satellite and MDS. Quite clearly, there was a critical responsibility for the minister to ensure that he was fully on top of what was likely to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinet took a decision that it wanted a pre-qualification put in place. It set out five propositions that ought to be included as hurdles. One of them is capability and whether there is a sound financial and business plan. One presumes that Senator Collins knew that, because he took the submission to cabinet. That having been the case, one again would think that he would have been acutely conscious of the need to ensure that, by one means or another, that sort of process was put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what seems to have happened is that from that point on he was off with the fairies. The department then went ahead, obtained some advice from the Attorney-General's Department that the submission could not actually deliver in those precise terms. No-one ever seems to have gone back to the minister and told him that, let alone invited him to explore some options. Any minister worth his salt would have done just that. He would have said, `Hang on. This is what cabinet wants. It wants a pre-qualification process. It does not want mickey mouse, fly-by-night tyre kickers', as we ultimately got. It wanted serious long-term players in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any minister who was at all interested in outcomes would then have said, `Hang on. How have they done it around the world? They have been able to have pre-qualifications hurdles put in in England and elsewhere, because we have had our bureaucrats over there talking to them. Let's work out a way of ensuring that we meet cabinet's dictates'. In fact, he did nothing of the sort. He basically was oblivious to all that was going on around him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that that is culpable negligence. If ever the minister had an obligation to be an active player in the process to ensure that what cabinet wanted was what transpired, it was this. But in fact, he did the opposite. What did we end up with&mdash;an absolutely ludicrous scheme that allowed people to put in place multiple bids without any deposit requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One applicant said to me, `You only had to put up $500. If you think that is a problem, I rang them up and said, "I can't actually get a bank cheque. Will you take my personal cheque?", and they said, "Certainly. Just send it in"'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is how ludicrous this whole system was. Here was a minister presiding over probably the greatest fiasco one could ever conceive. If we really wanted the thing to go off the rails and become an international laughing stock, this is pretty much the perfect formula: make sure that people can put in silly bids at silly figures which do not preclude Minister Beddall going out and saying, `These figures are absolutely right. I always thought that people underestimated the value.' He thought $389 million was pretty good. I reckon he will be pretty happy if the government ends up with about a third of that in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Senator Collins was in the unique position to ensure that the proper processes were put in place. He did none of it. When it comes to Senator Cooney's assessments, one finds not one word about constructive knowledge. There is not one word of what he ought to have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preceding page, headed `Operation of the Private Office', states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has acknowledged shortcomings which occurred in the operation of his private office, due in particular to staff absences during the January holiday period which led to breakdowns in the processing of documents through the office and to being distracted during the 1993 election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a plea of guilt out of his own mouth. That is precisely what Senator Collins said. Talk about an excess of frankness! He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is like an airline disaster  . . . The reason you rarely have an airline disaster is that it is a collection of a whole series of failures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The bureaucracy narrows down very quickly to a couple of people in the cockpit of the aircraft&mdash;if you like, my senior adviser, sitting in the seat next to me, and me as the captain of the aircraft, as the Minister, finally. When errors occur that combine failures on the ground, in the control tower, in the systems management and finally compounded in the cockpit, you get a disaster. I think the analogy is exact and I am part of that disaster.</PARA>
<PARA>Game, set and match. If the captain is not responsible, who is? It is like him getting the aircraft off the ground and then going down the back of it, drinking himself into oblivion for the next couple of hours and then wondering why it went down. The co-pilot&mdash;the senior adviser&mdash;was not even allowed to be called. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be perfectly clear on this: one thing Pearce was not allowed to do to earn his $37,000 in two weeks was to pass judgment on ministerial culpability. He was not there to do that. For the committee to spend the bulk of that report saying, `We accept the findings of Pearce' is absolutely irrelevant. It is totally beside the point. I have gone through the report in some detail to analyse the shortcomings in Pearce's evidence to the extent that they bear upon any culpability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, Pearce was simply not competent, on his own terms of reference, to pass judgment on this minister. That finding was the obligation of the committee. The committee cannot cop out of it by saying, `We accept Pearce's findings'. Pearce was not paid to do that job. The job he did does not assist the committee in passing judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One really could not get better evidence. I have seen some records of interview in my time, but when the defendant gets up and says, `I am part of that disaster', I would have thought there is a fairly good prima facie case of culpability. But we get the classic whitewash, `We are satisfied with all the circumstances'. The committee cannot go on with all that sort of nonsense.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins is not here charged with a criminal offence. Even his worst enemies would say that he is not in the classic mould of a criminal. But that in no way says that he is not incompetent or that he does not have a case to answer or that he did not muck this up from beginning to end. That is what this issue is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one is judging ministerial competence there is no point in coming in here and trotting out some criminal law proposition that one learnt in first year law. It has nothing to do with whether Senator Collins informed himself of what was going on, took an active interest in the process and carried out his job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why pay these ministers $100,000 plus&mdash;it is probably $150,000 with all the perks&mdash;if they are going to leave it to the department to make all these decisions and then say, `They did not tell me. A lot must have gone on and with hindsight, I wish I had known. But the fact is that I was up in Darwin in January and the phone did not ring, so I just signed this document.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we say in the report, some of reasons that were given and some of the findings that were accepted by this committee are classical. They reflect precisely what Senator Collins would have said to Professor Pearce. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings by Professor Pearce in relation to Term of Reference number 4 are a complete whitewash and heavily reflect the tenor of remarks made publicly by Senator Collins and presumably repeated in private to Professor Pearce. The statement that "the Minister signs a large number of documents of different kinds. He cannot be expected to peruse each of these closely" is pure Collins.</PARA>
<PARA>That is where I think it is verging on appalling that Professor Pearce should be drawn in in that way. Professor Pearce surely knows that this was not just another document. This was a document that started off a multimillion dollar process, something unique in the annals of television history that one day will hopefully lead at least to satellite pay television getting off the ground. This was a document that was a quite extraordinary start to a process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet for Senator Collins to trot out, as he has here&mdash;and obviously as he did to Professor Pearce&mdash;that he signs a lot of documents and cannot be expected to know what they are all about is Jim Cairns stuff. He got his and so should Senator Collins. He cannot say, `Well, I just sign anything that is put in front of me.' He has to ask a few questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, why do we pay these people heaps to be ministers. We pay them heaps because presumably they bring with them accumulated knowledge, experience, understanding of the processes and some basic commonsense. All of this should add up to a minister saying, `If I am given a document, I ought to know what it is about. If I do not understand, because I could not get into law school, then I get some advice from elsewhere. I ring up my staff or the department, or I make sure there is an accompanying brief so I know what I am signing.' None of that happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought Bruce Meagher is the classic example of a cover up.

It is all in secret, so we never know who said what and we do not know who asked him any questions. Who knows? No-one was there to cross-examine him. He probably sat across the table, said a few things to Professor Pearce who noted it all down and put it into his report. It is a classic exoneration formula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite were fair dinkum about this exercise they would have allowed witnesses to come forward who could have had a significant bearing on the inquiry. If there was one person who could have done so, it was Bruce Meagher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is just another objective sign that those opposite had a lot to be afraid of. I can understand it because, if we take his evidence at face value, Bruce Meagher would have confirmed that Senator Collins was not particularly interested. He delegated all these matters. He said, `Basically it is a matter for you. You make sure that it is all happening. If there are instructions to give, you give them. If there are problems, you solve them. If there are decisions to make, you make them.' All of this is a total abdication of responsibility. That is what this issue is all about. What standards does the government expect and has he met them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted that Senator Cooney did not attempt to refute any of our assessments of the quality of Professor Pearce's findings in the areas where they are relevant; all he did was point to the way in which we had expressed ourselves. This has nothing to do with the merits of the argument. If our points are valid, surely we are entitled to express them strongly. All those opposite have said is, `We used some soft rhetoric, you used some tough rhetoric and somehow that proves something'. It does not. The government has to look at the arguments and attempt to refute them. Those opposite made no such effort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the most important part of this first section of the inquiry, of which we have the report here this evening, is that which looks into the appropriate contemporary definition of ministerial responsibility. The first two hearings of this committee involved several former leaders, strategists, senior public servants, many academics and other experts in this field, if indeed we can say anybody is an expert in this field&mdash;although we feel that we are getting a bit closer now ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those hearings were quite fascinating. They were some of the most interesting I have ever been to. It was interesting that two points of view came out of them. Very substantially the first point of view&mdash;and I think it was the most prevalent&mdash;was that ministerial responsibility does exist. Only the Prime Minister&mdash;in fact really only the Queen&mdash;can take away somebody's ministerial responsibilities. But the Governor-General or the Governor, on behalf of the Queen, does that only on the advice of Prime Minister or the Premier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does come down to whether the ministers themselves have the confidence of the Prime Minister of the day and of their own caucus. To a certain extent it does come down to whether they have the confidence of the parliament in which they find themselves and whether they are able to operate effectively in that parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point of view that we heard was that it was none of our business. A couple of people did not really know why they had bothered to come before us to give evidence. They were being generous to us, so they gave us the benefit of their wisdom. That was actually the lesser view. There were only a couple of people who said that and they were related by ties of loyalty. It is a legitimate view. We found the other point of view was far more prevalent. The other point of view is the one that we have reflected in our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hearings involving the department I do not actually recall hearing or, indeed, reading anything which had not previously come to light in this chamber, in estimates, in Professor Pearce's reports or in the documents. I think there were about 2000 pages of documents that were tabled in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that part of the inquiry came down to is this: the whole pay-TV process was a disaster. We all know that. The disaster started years ago with Aussat. It was magnified by the legislation that was forced on this country last year by the government and the opposition and which then had to be corrected. That correction involved an accumulation of omissions, mistakes and, most of all by far, unforeseen consequences. I must say that, in some cases, the Democrats did foresee those consequences, but people would not listen to us. Fortunately, they were forced to in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has acknowledged his own and his officers' shortcomings in the tendering process. It now comes down to the vital question of whether the minister is able and willing to correct the problems which have been identified. A lot of problems have been identified and we want to see that they are corrected. That is what the second part of this report is about. I believe the second part of the report is vital to this whole inquiry. That is when we find out whether the minister has fulfilled his ministerial responsibilities in a mature and reasonable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take up much more of the Senate's time, but I must say that I am very disappointed with the dissenting report by Senator Alston and Senator Tierney. It does seem to me that mentioning the minister's size in this dissenting report is most unnecessarily personally offensive to the minister. I know the minister has a problem with his weight, but I do not think that needs to be put in a dissenting report. I have a very colourful turn of phrase on occasion, but I believe personal offensiveness in a report such as this is totally unnecessary. Not only is it totally unnecessary; it makes the dissenting report less credible than it could otherwise be. I recommend to any senators who are considering putting that sort of thing in any report that it just devalues their own report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney has used his favourite quote from Winston Churchill: `I didn't know; I wasn't told; I should have asked'. I prefer the quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> myself. The minister is told he should have asked a question, and he says, `But I didn't have the information to ask that question. How am I supposed to know what questions to ask?'. Sir Humphrey says, `That's the secret, Minister. We have to make sure you never know what questions to ask'. That is just as easily done to any individual or group in this place as it is to a minister. We have to keep in mind that we are not alone in that, and neither is the minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his contribution, Senator Cooney drew attention to a press statement released by Senator Alston on 20 August which outlined matters raised at one public meeting of the committee. If it were my wish to delay the Senate further, I would go on and speak about that meeting, but I would not speak as generously as Senator Alston did. However, I do not think that refuting back and forth across the chamber should happen. An agreement was reached by the committee in private session but, unfortunately, when we returned to public session, members of the committee who sit in the opposition benches then sought not to honour the agreement and a little political stunt was pulled for the benefit of the television cameras. I do not think that stunt damaged the committee in any way and I certainly do not believe it damaged the report. I hope that stunts like that will be put to one side when we continue with the second reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking on behalf of the government members of the committee&mdash;and Senator Bourne may or may not agree with me&mdash;I believe that, from our point of view, the committee took an unusual step in its deliberations. The government senators agreed&mdash;and we did have the numbers to stop it; there is no question about that&mdash;that the minister appearing before the committee would be sin-binned while the public inquiry was going on. I was not totally in support and in favour of following this course of action. However, for the sake of the committee and the inquiry&mdash;because it is an important inquiry&mdash;we agreed to do that. We did not take the decision lightly, and I do not believe the minister was particularly pleased with our actions. But I think it shows to some extent the lengths that the committee was prepared go to in order to have full, open and deliberate discussions on the matter that the Senate had put before the select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend a bit of time speaking about the minority report that has been presented by Senator Alston and Senator Tierney. Senator Tierney and his wife Pam had their 25th wedding anniversary last Saturday. We on all sides of the chamber congratulate them on achieving their 25th year of marriage. We wish them well for the next 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report shows that there were obviously intrusions on the good senator's time in developing the minority report over the weekend. His mind was on other matters. To that extent, he did not spend the time examining the evidence that was presented to this committee at the various public hearings that were held. Unfortunately, Senator Tierney took the opportunity in the minority report to attack Professor Pearce and the Pearce reports. They had earlier been presented to and debated in the chamber and that was the time when criticism should have been made of Professor Pearce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two reports were presented: the first report, which related to the circumstances surrounding the non-requirement of a deposit for satellite pay-TV licences and related matters, was presented on 20 May; and the second report, which inquired into certain aspects of the MDS tendering process in 1992-93, was presented on 26 May. Obviously, Senator Tierney had other matters on his mind. I do not know what was on Senator Alston's mind; I will not speculate on that matter. But they went into some depth and some detail to have a crack at Professor Pearce. In paragraph 33, they started by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce made no attempt to inquire why it was . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 34, they conclude by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and that Pearce has not even commented on such absence.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 35 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it beggars belief that Professor Pearce is able to say in paragraph 20 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 36 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also verging on the unbelievable that Pearce was unable to identify the origin . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 37 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce makes no criticism of the fact . . . </PARA>

<PARA>Paragraph 40 reads:</PARA>

<PARA>Paragraph 42 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings by Professor Pearce in relation to Term of Reference number 4 are a complete whitewash and heavily reflect the tenor of remarks made publicly by Senator Collins and presumably repeated in private to Professor Pearce . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 44 starts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce said that in a perfect world . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 45 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pearce implies that the Minister's advisers deserve criticism . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. Unfortunately, what appears to have happened is that, with his preoccupation with other matters over the weekend, all Senator Tierney has done is sort out the speaking notes that were prepared for him and Senator Alston when the Pearce reports were being debated in the parliament. They thought they might recycle for use in the debate on this report notes that were not used at that time. Senator Tierney and his colleague Senator Alston stand condemned for their actions in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report goes to some length in reaching its conclusions in paragraph 69. It repeats in full a remark made by Senator Collins at a public hearing. Senator Collins said, `It is like an airline disaster'. This was also mentioned by Senator Alston a little time ago. I wonder why Senator Alston and Senator Tierney, either individually or together, did not examine the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. If they had wanted to pick up a quote in which Senator Collins likened the happenings in the pay TV debacle&mdash;we all agree that there have been some big problems with it&mdash;to something else, why did they not use a quote from the superior forum, the Senate, as opposed to a Senate committee?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney also ought to be congratulated on the fact that not only were they able to have included at the beginning of the report Winston Churchill's quote `I did not know. I was not told. I should have asked', but they mentioned it again. That is really going over the top and filling out a minority report with something that is of no real help to the process. This really is not a minority report in the strictest sense of the word. We will certainly expect better from them when we consider the committee's second term of reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that in paragraphs 60 through to 68 of the minority report, Senator Tierney and Senator Alston have a go at Mr Meagher and the minister. Senator Tierney would be aware&mdash;and this is not mentioned in the minority report&mdash;that the committee sought advice from the Parliamentary Library to establish what precedents had occurred in this place or in the other chamber as to when a staffer, a member of a minister's staff, had been called to appear before a parliamentary committee. We sought that out; we asked the library for that information. The answer came back that it had never happened in the 93 years of the history of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took that matter into account when it deliberated and made its decision not to call Mr Meagher before it. We were acutely aware of the fact that, had we acceded to the request by Senators Alston and Tierney, we would be creating a precedent. After presenting the report, Senator Cooney went to some lengths to explain why we should not do that. I support the remarks made by Senator Cooney and also the remarks that he made during the deliberations of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will add a further dimension to those remarks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>Without having seen the documents that Senator McMullan has just tabled nor the letter from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) accompanying those documents, it is impossible to give a full response to Senator McMullan's action, other than to make a couple of points. First, the order to return of the Senate called on the government to respond and to lay these documents on the table by 5 o'clock today. I note that that time was not met. I understand that it was close to it, but nevertheless I make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and again in relation to what is contained in the documents, I note that Senator McMullan has said that it is not possible for the government to reply literally to the requests made of it by the Senate yesterday because&mdash;and I think I quote him fairly accurately&mdash;many of the documents do not exist. That is not a sufficient reason for refusing to comply with the order of the Senate. The whole history of the concept of a return to order goes back hundreds of years into the British parliamentary system. The whole purpose of it was to request governments to provide the parliaments of the day with information required by the parliament in terms of its legitimate role of being the custodian and to take account of people's rights, and also the need to hold governments of the day accountable and responsible for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the material does not literally exist at the moment is no valid defence of the fact that apparently the government has not complied with the return to order of the Senate. Indeed, we had a similar situation just a few months ago where the government did comply with such an order, which was moved by Senator Harradine, requiring documentation in relation to some work involving Australia Post. Those documents did not exist at the time that Senator Harradine made his request either, but the government did comply with the order by getting the necessary documentation done. So it is a totally specious and false defence that Senator McMullan has given in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not to answer an order to return is a very serious contempt of the Senate in respect of a matter quite fundamental to its essential role; namely, the scrutiny and passage of budget legislation. Failure to answer a return to order of any nature is a very serious contempt of the Senate. That is what the government appears to have done tonight. It has continued its practice of holding the parliament, and in particular this chamber, in contempt. It has done it in a technical way tonight as well as in terms of the spirit of the government's feelings on this. The opposition will let this matter rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand and acknowledge the fact that the government was given a brief period in which to reply to the Senate's request. For that reason, I will not be moving any further action on the matter tonight, but will request the government to reconsider the matter. If Senator McMullan, who on behalf of the government has just committed a major contempt of the Senate, has the courtesy to face us, to stop reading a paper and listen to something that is pretty serious, I want to ask him whether the government will reconsider the matter over the next couple of weeks, given that the Senate is not sitting at that time, or whether the government is now complete and adamant in its response that it will not provide any further information. I ask him to answer that when I finish my remaining few words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not credible for the government to say that it cannot obtain the material that has been sought by the Senate in its return to order. The material that is being sought was line ball with the material that was provided by the government to the parliament. Admittedly we had to draw the government's teeth to table the material in March 1992. That information related to material that was prepared in the latter part of 1991 concerning the opposition's taxation and expenditure proposals contained in Fightback. That information made it quite clear that material of the nature being sought in this return to order request by the Senate was available then. The Treasury's Prismod model, which had been set up solely for the purpose of analysing the coalition's Fightback policies, and the other modelling that is done in association with it can provide the material that has now been requested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1992, the then minister in his tabling statement referred to the analysis that had been conducted in the Treasury using the new Prismod model&mdash;or, to put it in full, the price revenue incidents simulation model, which models the impact of changes, particularly of a taxation nature but also outlays, on households and individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That analysis was done at that time. Indeed, the statement the government tabled in March last year in connection with the various tables that were presented stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining 12 tables bring together our modelling of the distributional implications of all of the individual components of the Opposition tax and expenditure package, including</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.indirect tax changes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.compensation arrangements and other increases in transfer payments;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the effects of bracket creep;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.certain expenditure cuts;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.illustrative household specific price effects of the health proposals described above; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the hypothetical roads charging proposals . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those items&mdash;the indirect changes, the effects of bracket creep and several others&mdash;are all fundamental to the government's budget this year. All those things contained in this Keating budget of 1993&mdash;the government's 55 per cent increase in the wine tax, its increase of between 10 and 20 per cent across the board on all sales taxes in Australia and its increase of up to 7c in fuel prices, which was to have been 10c&mdash;have significant distributional effects on households right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this parliament and this Senate are to properly do their job of analysing and considering, on behalf of the Australian people, the implications of the 1993 budget&mdash;a budget that has never been exceeded in terms of the degree of public disquiet and disgust at it&mdash;then it is quite essential that that distributional analysis be obtained. If it has not been prepared, it can be prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept at all the explanation that Senator McMullan has given tonight. As I say, we have not seen the documents he has tabled. We will look at them and decide the best course of further action to be taken with a view&mdash;this is the bottom line of all of this&mdash;to obtaining a situation where we can, on behalf of the Australian electorate, do our job as a Senate, as the elected representatives of the people, in analysing the impact of this very harsh, very cruel and very unfair budget on all Australians. </PARA>

We have a majority report from the government members of the committee and a minority report from the opposition members. The majority report is totally unacceptable to the opposition. Let me pay tribute to Senator Cooney, who in the last few days has been trying to bridge the yawning gap between the view of the government and that of the opposition on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion the government members finally came to was that Senator Collins has discharged his ministerial responsibilities in relation to the satellite and MDS tendering process. The opposition does not accept that. They gave him a pass and I just wonder what a minister in government has to do to get a fail.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disappointed by the contributions made before dinner on this matter. Senator Bourne spent most of her time talking about some absolutely obscure reference which she thought was a personal reflection of the physical attributes of the minister. It was so obscure that I had to read it several times to find it. Half of the speech was devoted to that. Seeing as the Democrats seem to be controlling the country at the moment, there does not seem to be much hope for us if that is the best they can contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan made a very long speech and filibustered very well to play out his time. He spent a lot of time talking about my 25th wedding anniversary. It was not a honeymoon; it was a 25th wedding anniversary. It did not really distract me greatly from the writing of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report we have written is in response to the enormous amount of time spent in the Senate and in the press and discussion in the media generally on what has been an absolute shambles in terms of running a government department. We believe our response is really the only realistic response to the inadequate and incompetent handling of this department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing that this minister has retained his position. He has embarrassed the government to the extent that in May it actually dropped in the polls. We have become the laughing stock of the overseas investment community, and Australian business that wanted to get seriously involved in the pay TV issue and take part in the development of this exciting new industry has been left in total confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would wonder why the minister took the approach that he did. If he knew anything about the history of the Department of Transport and Communications, he should have realised that a duty of care was necessary with a department that has had a very troubled history. Let me quote from what one of the icons of the Labor Party, Mr Whitlam, said at the hearing in Melbourne. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The department concerned is the inheritor and the amalgamation of the two greatest disaster areas in federal administration during the 1980s. The department, in both its character, the electronic media and transport, has clearly been staffed at crucial levels by incompetent people.</PARA>
<PARA>If we take the track record of the department and add to it the very rapidly changing technology in communications in this country and the fact that we are restructuring that industry and moving from a monopoly position to competition and if we have a situation where the department has been `administered'&mdash;for want of a better term&mdash;by six different Labor ministers in a very short period of time, one would think we would have a minefield, a disaster waiting to happen. Given that history, the minister's approach, in which he has not shown a duty of care, is quite astounding. He certainly has not been on top of his department; he has been on tap, but he has not been on top. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is of relevance. There were a lot of questions the minister did not ask; he did not even think to ask them. Surely, if we are moving into a new technology, like pay television, and we are expecting people to invest in a multimillion dollar industry, an industry worth hundreds of millions of dollars, it is not just any old bit of paper the minister is signing; it is a very vital determination. If the minister did not understand it, he should have made sure he had support staff there at the time who did understand it and who could advise him and say, `Hey, Minister, how about the five per cent deposit? That is not here. Sometimes with the tendering processes of the department of communications we have deposits; at other times we don't have deposits. There should have been a deposit here'. That is what an adviser worth his salt would have done; in this particular case it did not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's excuse was quite pathetic. He said, `Well, I sight hundreds of documents'. But this was no ordinary document. He should have understood what he was signing. Since May he has been trying to blame everyone but himself. He said at first in May that it was the department's fault; he said it was the election's fault. But, really, he hit the nail right on the head in the hearings into pay TV&mdash;and I think it will go down as one of the classic quotes in Australian politics. Again let me tell the Senate what he said. In describing the pay television tendering processes, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's like an airline disaster . . . The reason you rarely have an airline disaster is that it is a collection of a whole series of failures . . . The bureaucracy narrows down very quickly to a couple of people in the cockpit of the aircraft&mdash;if you like, my senior adviser, sitting in the seat next to me, and me as the captain of the aircraft, as the Minister, finally. When errors occur that combine failures on the ground, in the control tower, in the systems management and finally compounded in the cockpit, you get a disaster. I think the analogy is exact and I am part of that disaster.</PARA>
<PARA>After saying that the minister should have offered his resignation straight away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the standards of public administration in this country? Can ministers actually do anything, have no duty of care and just let any disaster happen? What would happen in private enterprise? How long would a CEO who took that broad approach last? But that seems to be the approach that we have had here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably most disturbing about the approach&mdash;and certainly about the whole history of this inquiry&mdash;is that, even though we have been able to talk to every relevant public servant who had anything to do with this, from a fair way down in the department of communications all the way up to the minister, there was one vital piece missing. That was the co-pilot&mdash;to continue with the minister's analogy&mdash;Mr Meagher. He seems to have possessed some critical information. That seems to be our view. But, according to the minister, no, he could speak on Mr Meagher's behalf. Why could Mr Meagher not speak for himself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had hearings here in Canberra and the government used its numbers to block the committee calling Mr Meagher. I think that made the situation worse. If Mr Meagher had nothing to hide, why did he not come before the committee? It just left everyone wondering. The suspicion is accentuated by the fact that, when I was looking over the final report, I could not find any reference in the last section to Mr Meagher. I went back to the first draft, and there it was all set out. Somehow between the first and last draft it mysteriously disappeared. Is it any wonder we do not have any confidence in the government report? That is one of the reasons why I think we were quite right to bring in a minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of the government report, of course, is to absolve Senator Collins. The basis on which government members would do this largely goes back to what I call the Wran line in the hearings. Ex-Labor Premiers Wran and Cain said that determining mini-sterial responsibility and whether a minister should be sacked or not was really a judgment based on the severity of the minister's misconduct. It was not really that, but it was the reaction&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To the public media. I ask Senator Loosley to have a look back at what Mr Hamer said. I do not think he took that line. Mr Wran, a former barrister, had a brief to defend the minister, so he put as liberal an interpretation on the whole matter as was possible. Really, he just said that the whole thing is a political exercise. But the doctrine of ministerial responsibility, as we argue in our minority report, is far too important to be treated as a political exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do other former leaders say about this matter? Former Prime Ministers Hawke and Fraser rightly supported the maximum penalty of ministerial resignation in situations where a bungle of key importance to Australia's future occurred in a department. They made moral judgments on these matters and decided that the minister is responsible to the parliament and the people&mdash;not just to the party. This judgment should be reflected in a call for resignation by the Prime Minister of the day. It certainly should have happened in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should assess the seriousness of the minister's actions, rather than what the effect of those actions is likely to be on the government's popularity. Instead of ministerial resignation being a means to remove pressure from the government, it should be a means to make the minister responsible to the Prime Minister, the parliament and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not spend more time going through the section in our minority report relating to the satellite tendering process and also the section of the report relating to the MDS tendering process. Senator Alston has covered this in great detail, and people who want to read more about it should read the full report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I return to Senator Collins's reference to this matter being like an airline disaster. He said, `I am part of the disaster'. I remind senators that the minister is the vital  link between the cabinet and his department He therefore has a duty of care to ensure that cabinet decisions are carried out properly. If the minister fails to understand what he is implementing through his and his department's actions, then I ask: what is the point of having a minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating should heed his own words and put morality and ethics above politics in this matter. Senator Collins made Australia an international laughing stock and instead of accepting ministerial responsibility tried to shift the blame. He has so mishandled this policy area that I am highly surprised he has not resigned or the Prime Minister has not called for his resignation. </PARA>

The first thing that ought to be said is that it is not a government report; it is a majority report. Senator Tierney's terminology is designed to be a deliberate slight of Senator Bourne. Senator Bourne exercised her own judgment and discretion, worked through the report and came to a conclusion which is shared by a majority of senators on the committee.

The chamber ought to be aware of this because, frankly, the committee has been a waste of taxpayers' money. Members of the coalition did not come into it with open minds.

The coalition was never prepared to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report is nothing other than hyperbole. There is a remark about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). What on earth does that remark about the Prime Minister have to do with Minister Collins's responsibility? There is no evidence to suggest that Minister Collins breached any concept of ministerial responsibility. As a matter of fact, in terms of Minister Collins giving evidence to the committee, the coalition was so concerned about what he might say that we spent more time discussing where the minister should sit in relation to the committee than was spent at the Paris peace talks when they were trying to seat the NLF in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end there was a compromise that he should sit off to one side. This only lasted a day or so; then the minister was seated with his bureaucratic advisers, similar to the estimates committee procedure, which Senator McKiernan and I had argued should apply. The chairman, in order to be fair to the coalition, had agreed upon its proposition. This only lasted a day and was seen as being totally impractical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one stage I suggested to some of the departmental advisers who were giving evidence that all they should do was read the transcript of previous answers to the committee into the transcript of that day's hearings because all Senator Tierney and Senator Alston could do was repeat the questions they had asked either in the chamber or at the committee&mdash;not for the second or third time, but for the sixth or seventh or eighth time. It was a classic display of lack of originality. The process was so tedious, as Senator Tierney alleged earlier, because of the absolute and utter lack of originality on the part of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Acting Deputy President, I ask you to look in this report and find one original idea from the coalition senators, one original question in any of the transcripts of the committee's deliberations in any of the hearings, or to find anything new. That is why they ran out of material. That is why Senator Alston had to disappear and write yet another press statement. We were so impressed with the press release that Senator Cooney wanted to incorporate it in the committee's findings. It was just a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be comical in total if public funds were not being wasted on this nonsensical approach to politics. The coalition ought to be able to do better. The simple fact of the matter is that we have now had more than 70 questions on this matter in the chamber. We have now had eight debates&mdash;this is the eighth debate&mdash;on this matter. There is absolutely nothing new in anything that Senator Alston or Senator Tierney have said today&mdash;nothing new; not an original thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on this side of the chamber and people in the Democrats have actually tried to work the matter through and come to a logical conclusion. That is why there is a degree of non-partisanship on the basis of the majority report. The partisanship is to be found opposite from Senator Tierney and, again, from the absent Senator Alston. I anticipate yet another press release later tonight. Again, unfortunately, Senator Alston is absent. But I say to the Senate: look at the transcripts; look at the deliberations; look at the evidence; look at the hearings. There is no other conclusion possible. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for Minister Collins, he could not have been more accessible to the committee; he could not have been more open with the committee. Taking the words from Senator Tierney directly, `He could not have been more honest with the committee'. Where fault was to be found, he accepted it and the majority of the committee members respected that. The opposition endeavoured to restrict Senator Collins in what he might make by way of contribution but, in spite of that, he was accessible, he was open and he was honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney referred to the yawning gap which existed on the committee. Honestly! The only yawning that took place was that done by the government senators on the basis of the questions being asked ad nauseam, time and time again. That brings me to the point about all of the departmental advisers being called before the committee time and time again. It is similar to people being required to attend estimates committee hearings at 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. Look at the waste involved in that&mdash;the waste of energy and endeavour and the waste of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a manifestation of oppositionism&mdash;an absolute reflection of oppositionism. No matter how much those opposite caterwaul, they cannot get around that. Those opposite are really sliding away. It reminds me of what the Labor Party was like in the early 1960s. That is how grim things are opposite. It took us a decade to come out of opposition; it will take those opposite another decade the way they are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney referred to a debacle. This committee has been a debacle. We are lucky that the report is so good, that it is possessed of such clarity and such reasoned conclusions, and Senator Cooney and the secretary can take credit for that. Senator Bourne made some suggestions and alterations. Senator McKiernan and I were happy to endorse the findings. But the committee has been a debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people deliberately come aboard an endeavour for the express purpose of making nothing other than political nonsense, it will be a debacle every time and the Senate really ought to take note of that. It really needs to take on board the manner in which we create some of these select committees. I think there is a place in the system for select committees, as I think there is a place for joint and standing committees, but there is no place for manipulation and the sheer indulgence of oppositionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the remarks of Senator Bourne earlier in the debate were entirely appropriate. I defend her on the basis of respect for a colleague in the chamber but, more importantly, I defend her on the basis that she is a friend, and friendship has to count for more than politics. Senator Bourne brought a greater sense of perspective and realism to the report than anybody else who sat on the committee. She has a specific portfolio responsibility, which neither Senator McKiernan, nor Senator Cooney, nor I have. In Senator Alston's case, we could have been forgiven for thinking that his policy expertise was to be found in trade or foreign policy rather than in communications, given the lack of expertise demonstrated during the committee's deliberations. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill will amend the tax laws to give effect to a number of changes arising from the 1993-94 budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I propose to outline briefly the measures contained in this bill. More detailed explanations of the measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Personal tax cuts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in the bill will change the timing for the commencement of the two stage reduction in the tax rates announced in One Nation on 26 February 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first stage will now commence on 15 November 1993, seven and a half months earlier than scheduled. The bill provides that the second stage of tax cuts will commence at the beginning of a financial year to be fixed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the first stage of the tax cuts will commence on 15 November 1993, the bill contains the new composite rate scales to apply for 1993-94 and the first stage rates for the 1994-95 and later income years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rates to apply from 15 November 1993 will benefit taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $20,700.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax cuts will cost the revenue $1.55 billion this financial year. The ongoing cost to revenue of the first stage of the personal tax cuts is $2.9 billion in 1994-95 and $3.12 billion in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Low income rebate</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide a rebate of up to $150 to taxpayers whose taxable income for 1993-94 and subsequent income years is less than $24,450. The new rebate will mainly assist those taxpayers who do not benefit from the One Nation tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxpayers with a taxable income of up to $20,700 will be entitled to a rebate of $150 in their assessments for the 1993-94 and later income years. The rebate will reduce at the rate of 4 cents in each dollar of taxable income in excess of $20,700 and completely phase-out when taxable income reaches $24,450.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated revenue costs for this measure are $530 million in 1994-95, $515 million in 1995-96 and $500 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare levy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the low income thresholds below which people will not be required to pay any levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For 1993-94, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $12,688 and couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $21,366 will not be required to pay the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no change to the provisions which increase the threshold for couples and sole parents by $2100 for each dependent child or student.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost of the increased low income thresholds is $30 million in 1993-94, $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unused annual leave and unused long service leave payments</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will remove the concessional tax treatment that applies to lump sum payments of unused annual leave and unused long service leave made on termination of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payments in respect of unused long service leave accrued on or after 18 August 1993 and payments in respect of unused annual leave made on or after 18 August 1978 will be taxed as normal income. However, there is no change to the tax treatment of these payments if the taxpayer's termination of employment is as a consequence of bona fide redundancy or invalidity or is under an approved early retirement scheme. Nor is the concessional tax treatment of long service leave accrued before 18 August 1993 affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments ensure that the tax system does not discourage taxpayers from using their leave entitlements for their intended purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to the revenue is $80 million in 1993-94, $180 million in 1994-95, $165 million in 1995-96 and $180 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation of credit unions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will remove the exemption from income tax for income in the nature of interest received by credit unions on loans made to their members and will allow credit unions to be taxed as cooperatives where they satisfy the requirements for that treatment. To give credit unions time to adjust to the new measures, there will be a phasing-in period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure will remove the competitive advantage credit unions enjoy as a result of the special tax treatment given to them, and is consistent with the government's general approach of ensuring tax neutrality between business enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $25 million in 1995-96 and $30 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation of friendly societies and other registered organisations</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will change the taxation treatment of friendly societies and other registered organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will phase-out, over three years from the 1994-95 income year, the concessional tax rate for friendly societies in respect of their life insurance and certain other insurance business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence of that change, the bill will, from 1 July 1994, extend to friendly societies the same entitlement to deductions as is allowed to life insurance companies for the costs of getting in their life insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another change will increase, from 1 July 1995, the rebate available to holders of friendly society life policies who are assessed on bonuses. This increase is a consequence of the phasing-out of the concessional tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue from these measures is $25 million in 1995-96 and $69 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Car parking expenses for self-employed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the income tax law so that, from 1 July 1994, a tax deduction for the cost of car parking for persons other than employees will be denied in certain circumstances. This will place car parking by self-employed persons on a comparable tax basis to car parking for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A deduction for car parking expenses incurred by self-employed persons will only be denied where certain conditions apply. The rules for determining the non-deductible amount of a car parking expense in this bill are similar to the rules applicable to employers in valuing a car parking fringe benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue of this measure is $70 million in 1995-96 and $35 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-deductible expenses</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income tax law will also be amended to allow deductions to employers for expenses incurred in providing their employees with a range of benefits such as entertainment, club fees, leisure facilities, travel expenses of accompanying relatives, Higher Education Contribution Scheme payments and Student Financial Supplement Scheme payments. These expenses have previously not been deductible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefits of this nature, if provided to employees, are fringe benefits under the fringe benefits tax law. However, the taxable value of these benefits is reduced to the extent to which they are non-deductible to employers under the income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment, which will apply from 1 April 1994,  will allow a deduction to employers for these expenses under the income tax law. In consequence, it will subject these benefits to a fringe benefits tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $435 million in 1994-95, $240 million in 1995-96 and $240 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FBT rate of tax</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the current rate of fringe benefits tax from 48.25 per cent to 48.4 per cent. The increase will take effect from 1 April 1994 and will maintain the alignment of the FBT rate with the top marginal personal tax rate and Medicare levy rate. The increase reflects the increase in the Medicare levy rate, from 1.25 per cent to 1.4 per cent, on 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $9 million in 1994-95 and $8 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excess domestic travel</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the fringe benefits tax law to impose fringe benefits tax on the amount of a travelling allowance received by an employee for travel in Australia which is in excess of a prescribed amount. The amount will be prescribed by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income tax law will also be amended to disallow expenditure incurred by employees or self-employed persons on travel expenses (i.e. accommodation, food, drink, and expenditure incidental to travel undertaken in Australia) which are in excess of the prescribed amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated gain to revenue is $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales tax</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I now turn to the three sales tax changes proposed in the bill. The first change will increase all sales tax rates by one percentage point, with effect from midnight tonight. This is expected to raise $435 million this year and $585 million in 1994-95. A further one percentage point increase for all sales tax rates will come into effect on 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second change will increase the rates of sales tax on wine, also with effect from midnight tonight. Compared to beer and spirits, wine is lightly taxed. While it is presently subject to sales tax, it does not carry any excise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to increase the rate of tax on wine with an alcoholic content of greater than 1.15 per cent from 20 per cent to 31 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of tax on low-alcohol wine, that is wine with an alcoholic content of 1.15 per cent or less, is to increase from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. Some low-alcohol wine is currently taxable at 20 per cent and its rate of tax will increase to 21 per cent in line with the proposed increase for all sales tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $70 million in 1993-94, $95 million in 1994-95, $105 million in 1995-96 and $110 million in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last sales tax change will vary the rate of tax applicable to luxury motor vehicles, also with effect from midnight tonight. Luxury vehicles are currently taxable at 30 per cent on their entire wholesale value. The current sales tax treatment results in a substantial pricing distortion:  the addition of one dollar to the wholesale price of a passenger motor vehicle now priced at the threshold would increase the sales tax liability by $4873.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to remove this distortion by applying a split rate of sales tax to luxury motor vehicles. Broadly, the ordinary rates of sales tax applicable to motor vehicles will apply up to wholesale luxury threshold. A rate of 45 per cent will apply to that portion of the wholesale value over the luxury threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated to be $5 million in 1993-94 and $10 million in 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 is one of the trio of so-called deficit reduction bills. That is a classic misnomer as far as at least one of them is concerned&mdash;that is, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill&mdash;because this year the budget is aiming for an increase in the deficit, not a reduction. The first thing to be said about the trio of bills is that some of them are misleading in their description.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill deals specifically with the petrol and tobacco duty slugs announced in the 17 August budget and the additional increases in those charges that have been announced since then as we have moved successively through budget mark 2 and budget mark 3&mdash;and I have no doubt that we will soon have budget mark 4. It is that budget and its subsequent rejigging that I wish to say a few words about in this first reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Rejigging' is far too polite a term for what has happened to this budget because this first budget of the re-elected Keating Labor government has been absolutely gutted by the government itself in response to the pressure put on by the opposition since it was brought down. Never in my recollection&mdash;nor, I would guess, in the memories of very many other honourable senators&mdash;have we seen a budget which has unravelled from day one in such a short time as this budget has. It is no wonder, because this budget was the most directionless, harsh, cruel and inappropriate budget that has been brought down in our living memory. The first budget of the re-elected Keating government was supposed to set out the Labor vision for the medium term and reveal the government's thinking and policy on key policy problem areas in Australia. It was supposed to not only deal with the pressing immediate problems but also offer a long-term prospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will undoubtedly remember the great build-up to the budget along the lines that it would really put things into perspective for the medium term&mdash;a budget that dealt with the short-term problems but which, more importantly, had a path, a vision and an end objective of a better budgetary situation, higher standards of living, fewer unemployed, more jobs and a better quality of life for all Australians. Never have we seen a budget more to the contrary of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is completely without vision, it offers no hope, no opportunity and no prospects for Australians for the future, and it has been seen as such not only in the general community but also in the business community and, indeed, internationally. If we look at what has happened to the Australian dollar since the budget details were announced and, more particularly, as it started progressively to unravel, it provides a very stark testimony to what has been an absolute disaster for this country economically, socially and politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems facing Australia are readily apparent. We have mass unemployment&mdash;the likes of which this country has never seen since the Great Depression&mdash;peaking at over 11 per cent and unlikely to fall below double digits for at least another couple of years. The government acknowledges in its budget papers the fact that in 12 months time the level of unemployment will be little, if any, different from what it is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have another cataclysmic problem with the abysmal savings performance that this country has been able to put in over recent years, both at the public sector and private sector level. It is a performance that lies fairly and squarely at the feet of this government because of its mismanagement of the economy. We have a household savings ratio of around four per cent, the lowest in our history; public sector borrowings are running at about $20 billion per year; and we have a budget deficit for the Commonwealth alone which, on an accumulated basis, has now totalled $40 billion over the last three years alone. Over that period we have seen an increase in the Commonwealth government's debt to a figure approximating $80 billion, yet only three years ago the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said that Commonwealth government debt would be zero by 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a nation that has become increasingly dependent on foreign borrowings to attempt to maintain its sliding living standards. Foreign debt&mdash;that is, the extent to which this country is in debt to foreigners&mdash;is now over $160 billion in net terms and more than $200 billion in gross terms. That is equivalent to about $50,000 per average Australian family or $12,000 per individual Australian. When this government took office just 10 years ago that net $160 billion figure was about $25 billion. There has been a six to eight fold increase in our debt over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an appalling level of investment, which, after having fallen for the past three years to the lowest levels again on record&mdash;we have actually eaten into the capital stock of this country; we have seen the capital stock of this country run down over that period&mdash;still shows no signs of picking up. As I said, the productive capital base on some estimates is actually eroding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need any more studies commissioned or white papers prepared to know what our problems are. The national fiscal outlook paper produced at the recent premiers conference, the FitzGerald report on national savings, the forthcoming white paper on unemployment all have, or will, tell us what we already know, which is that these are massive problems; they require creative and visionary solutions and this government's policies have been a complete failure in addressing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On election night both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) named jobs as the goal of this government's term. Indeed, on budget night, the Treasurer also mentioned jobs as being the budget's primary objective. What did the budget, with its medium-term strategy, actually achieve? It slugged businesses&mdash;the productive job creating sector of the economy&mdash;with complex additional taxes which are reflected and contained in the bills being introduced into the Senate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It more than halved the personal income tax cuts that had been solemnly promised and legislated into, to quote the Prime Minister before the election, `l-a-w'. Personal income tax cuts for lower and middle income households were promised. The government never promised any tax cut for lower income households where the income was less than $20,700 a year. It has now made a completely inadequate, puny attempt to redress that gross inequity in its election policy promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the personal income tax cuts that it promised are concerned, the government has pushed two-thirds of them into the never-never. The best the Treasurer can now say is that that major part of the promised tax cuts will occur `probably in 1998'. That is two elections away&mdash;five years away. Those tax cuts will never eventuate. The government has obviously abandoned them post haste. They will never be seen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By its own forecast, the budget fails to produce or, more appropriately, provide the climate to produce more jobs, investment or savings. It has further increased public sector borrowings to an enormous level. This year, public sector borrowings by the Commonwealth sector alone will exceed $20,000 million. That is a figure which is absolutely and totally inappropriate to the situation that we face as a nation. So on all the criteria to judge it, this budget fails. It is another deceit, a lie, a dishonesty and a breach of trust that this Labor Party and its leader have foisted upon the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government seems simply unable, unwilling or unprepared to address the major national problems that it created but never expected to have to fix. The bills that will be introduced into the Senate tonight&mdash;there will be much more debate on and examination of them in committee and subsequently in this chamber&mdash;simply add to the problems facing our country. They in no way attack in any sustainable, long-term, carefully planned way the problems that we face. They create not one more job. Indeed, they hinder the further development of productive investment and savings, economic production and job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills are a disaster of the first order. As the opposition has said many times in recent days, and as 74 per cent of the Australian electorate said in response to a poll that was published in the last 24 hours, there is only one thing that this government ought to be doing about its budget&mdash;that is, taking it back to the drawing board and starting again, because there is no way that it could possibly do a worse job than it has done this time. In the interests of all Australians and in the interests of the future of the Australian economy, it is mandatory, in my view, for the government to go back to basics and start again on this budget. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Act 1981 to raise the maximum rate of oil pollution levy which can be applied to commercial shipping using Australian ports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy, which was introduced in 1973, provides funds towards the costs associated with operation of Australia's National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Plan brings together Commonwealth, State and Territory and industry expertise and combat capacity under one national contingency plan. Since 1 January 1991, it has been administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy funds the administration of the National Plan, including equipment acquisition, maintenance and training. It also provides a contingency fund to cover costs incurred in responding to marine pollution incidents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently provides that the rate of levy (per quarter) is such rate, not exceeding 4 cents per ton of the tonnage of the ship, as is prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rate of levy at present prescribed by Regulation is 2.2 cents per ton. However it is intended that this rate be raised to 4 cents per ton from 1 October 1993. This increase will enable AMSA to implement the recent decisions of Commonwealth and State Transport Ministers aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These decisions flowed from consideration of a high level review of the National Plan by a Commonwealth/State/Industry Working Party. Additional funds are required to  purchase additional response equipment to enhance response capability in the event of major spills and put in place contractual arrangements to enhance fixed wing dispersant delivery capability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the prescribed rate of levy to meet these additional funding demands will, however, remove the leeway that has previously existed between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the limit on the levy set by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This leeway is essential to allow AMSA to react speedily to a large funding requirement that might arise in the case of a major incident. While in almost all cases costs of responding to oil pollution incidents are recovered from the polluter, there is an immediate call on funds, and it may be some time before these can be recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In such cases the ability to increase the levy by regulation will allow AMSA to borrow funds at short notice by giving it the financial capacity to service and repay such a loan from the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the maximum rate of levy that can be prescribed to 6 cents per ton as proposed in this legislation maintains the current relationship between the rate of levy prescribed by regulation and the maximum rate capable of being prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government hopes of course that we will never need to raise the rate of levy to pay for the clean up of a major spill. The Government believes, however, that it is essential for AMSA to have the capability to respond quickly should such an unfortunate event occur.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to the decision announced in the Budget to change the safety net arrangements applying to general patients under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PBS, which for more than 40 years has been providing the Australian community with access to necessary medicines, enjoys international recognition for its success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of adjustments are being made to the PBS through the 1993-94 Budget to further improve its cost effectiveness and operating efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PBS safety net, which was introduced in 1986 to help people who need a lot of medicines, will remain available. There will be no changes to the safety net arrangements for pensioners and other concessional beneficiaries. Changes are being made, however, to general patients' entitlements under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 the use of medicines under the free safety net for general patients increased by more than 150 per cent over the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With an ageing population and the development of new drugs, the costs of operating the PBS are increasing every year. In 1992-93, for instance, costs increased by 25 per cent over the previous financial year to around $1.5 billion. This cost must eventually be borne by the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, there has been a growing tendency for people to stockpile medicines. In 1992 more than 70 per cent of the annual number of prescriptions for general patients were supplied in the last two months of the safety net period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces a number of changes to address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The safety net scheme has been simplified for general patients by eliminating the second (free) limit and increasing the first (concessional) limit to $400 per year (indexed). Once a general patient and members of his or her family have this amount recorded on their Prescription Record Form, pharmaceutical benefits will be available at the concessional rate of $2.60 (indexed) for the remainder of that calendar year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This replaces a more complex two-step safety net system under which a general patient qualified for concessional benefits after spending $312.30 on pharmaceutical benefits in a calendar year and then for free benefits after spending a further $52.00 in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change is expected to reduce outlays by $12.4 million in 1993-94, $32.0 million in 1994-95, $33-4 million in 1995-96 and $34.9 million in 1996-97.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Bounty Ships Act 1989 to extend the shipbuilding bounty from 30 June 1995 until 30 June 1997. The bill implements a government election commitment to phase down the bounty in line with general manufacturing tariffs. The new rates listed in the bill are between 10 per cent phasing down to five per cent in 1997 compared to the old ones, which would now be on a five per cent rate ending in 1997. The coalition will not be opposing this bill. It is a bill for which the government announced its proposals before the election. Apart from that, we do not have a problem with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does have some concerns about the bill. Our major concern is, as with so many other industry assistance measures, as to the approach taken by the Labor Government to these matters. The latest buzz phrase `world's best practice' is a very important term, despite the jargon, and really means something that is fundamental to the future well-being of our economy. The government's approach to this need for world's best practice, the need for Australia to be internationally competitive in our manufacturing and indeed in all other sectors of productive activity, is: `Not yet, not ready, not able and not willing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This defeatist approach is self-evident from the government's failure to achieve the necessary micro and macro-economic reforms that are so essential for us to compete with the world's best. If one listens to the rhetoric of the government one would be fairly impressed. It talks tough but acts weak, if at all. It is a bit like the budget that we have seen over the past couple of weeks. There is a bit more spending, a bit more tax, a bit more debt, no strategy, and no vision. The government's attitude is, `Let us deal with the problem as it comes along and try to patch it up'. As a result we have had a massive unravelling of the budget and it is typical of the government's approach to economic policy, including industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has not taken the steps that are necessary if we are going to see manufacturing industry in this country, be it shipbuilding or any other form of manufacturing activity, achieve the international competitiveness that the nation so desperately requires. Unless we are prepared to take the necessary decisions and actions, and not just utter fine words, to actually lower our costs, not only in absolute terms but also relative to the rest of the world, then we will never increase our international competitiveness and therefore our ability to sell around the world. That involves taking many significant actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor, for example, has failed totally on industrial relations&mdash;productivity agreements are limited and only introduced with union fiat. As we have seen over the last couple of days, the government has capitulated in a most appalling and craven manner to the ACTU on the question of the role of unions in enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a seen a situation in which the government and the Prime Minister have completely reversed the situation that was outlined during the election campaign. The Prime Minister said that non-union members ought to be able to negotiate and participate in enterprise agreements. Bill Kelty, the ACTU and the union movement did not like that too much, so over the past couple of days we have a seen a total capitulation by the government to the ACTU on that issue. Unless we get the necessary flexibility into our wage fixing systems and into the whole question of industrial relations, we will never be able to get the arrangements that will enable us not only to benefit the individual workers involved but also, and equally importantly, to produce the competitive situation which will allow jobs to be created, our economy to grow and our living standards to be increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has also failed equally abysmally on tax reform. The government seems to know pretty well how to increase business costs, slug businesses and also families. Under this government's `smother everything' tax policy, tax law has become an administrative and financial nightmare. We had an exercise last year or the year before to simplify sales tax and finished up with a more complicated mess than before. Not only have we seen a failure in the administrative sense, but we have seen massive increases in taxation. We now have the government leaving open the option of introducing a wealth tax and an income tax levy on high income earners when it specifically said before the election that it would not increase taxes or introduce any new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a government that is increasing the tax on one of Australia's most promising export industries, the wine industry, by no less than 55 per cent. That is a staggeringly high increase and it will cause great damage to the wine industry as it attempts to build its way still further into international markets and thereby contribute to Australia desperately needed foreign exchange earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government in its last budget imposed further savage increases on transport of all descriptions in Australia. The budget through its fuel tax increases has placed added operational costs on railway enterprises throughout Australia. For example, in the case of Australian National Rail alone the increase will be $4 1/4 million. In my own State of Victoria it is will increase rail costs by $2 1/2 million; in New South Wales by around $9 million; and in Western Australia by $2 million. There is no logic at all in increasing the price of everything that has a rail freight component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one can go working one's way right through the budget measures and the general policy measures that have been introduced by this government over years as it has worked its way into a situation where it deliberately engineered the greatest recession that Australia has had since the great depression of the 1930s. Australia is still in a deeply recessed state with almost a million Australians officially unemployed, another million Australians underemployed, investment going through the floor and with no prospect of any significant recovery in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former finance minister Mr Peter Walsh said in a speech the other night that the government is not addressing Australia's fundamental economic problems. He said that the fundamental economic problems will not be resolved by having debates and conventions about flags and constitutions. Mr Peter Walsh is absolutely right. That seems to be about the only way that this government feels it can go at the moment in terms of policy direction. It is a sure sign that this government has lost the plot. It is directionless and it is drifting. That is a very dangerous situation not only for the government but much more seriously than that, for the Australian nation to find itself confronted with. Labor has failed to create an environment for savings and investment. Without these key interrelated economic variables, Australia's recovery prospects are grim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, every time the government introduces an industry bill, we have to go over the same issues time and time again. It has been going on for a decade now and still the government does not seem to be able to listen, to act or to understand the essentials underlying the problems that we face and the problems that have become much more deeply ingrained as a result of the government's incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for the extension of the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993 reflect the types of issues I have raised tonight. I urge the government yet again to try to get its act together in terms of a policy for industry which actually reduces costs and which helps industry to become more internationally competitive, more productive and, therefore, able to make the contribution that, with the right environment, it has enormous scope and potential to do on behalf of all of us. If we do not have a viable, dynamic manufacturing industry, then we, as a nation, are very much the poorer. It is about time this government understood that and it is about time this government started to understand the basic challenges facing it and its basic requirements of achieving those objectives on behalf of not only the industries but also, as I said, the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993. The main purpose of the bill is to implement the government's election commitment announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 24 February 1993 to reduce the shipbuilding bounty at a rate which reflects the reduction in general manufacturing tariffs as set down in the government's Building a Competitive Australia statement on 12 March 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practical terms, this will mean that the phase-down of the bounty rates in the Bounty (Ships) Act 1989 is slowed down from an immediate drop of a full five per cent, which is currently scheduled for 1 July 1993. In its place, a more gradual phase-down rate of one per cent each financial year will apply so that the current 10 per cent rate is reduced to five per cent after 1 July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to introduce a more gradual reduction in the shipbuilding bounty was made `after consultation between the government and the Australian Shipbuilders' Association'. It is designed to sustain the competitive gains made by the industry. As industry spokesperson for the Australian Democrats, I did not take the government's word for it. I sought to undertake some consultation with the shipbuilding industry. I found that, in general terms, those people with whom we were able to consult certainly agreed that this was a welcome measure for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little cautious in expressing my view. Invariably, one cannot consult with everyone in the industry and, just like the small winegrowers, it is mainly the family vineyards that would be taking the brunt if the government were successful in introducing the wine tax. So there are bound to be some shipyards and some producers in this industry which may find even this measure a little difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, it is a welcome change for the government to undertake what appears to be a carefully thought out plan for an industry. This stands in contrast to measures such as the proposed wine tax. That measure was simply used as a revenue raising measure, without any thought of its consequences for the economic wellbeing of the industry and the social effects on the people who are employed in it&mdash;let alone the future prospects of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shipbuilding industry certainly appears to be one of the bright spots on the Australian manufacturing scene. The industry has become a major export earner for Australia and is likely to enjoy strong profitable growth in the next century. Australia currently leads the way in the design and production of high-speed ferries, luxury motor yachts and patrol boats, and is poised to spearhead the ongoing development of the high-speed technology to other applications, such as large size passenger ferries and fast freight vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that we are looking at an industry that can contribute considerably in the future, both to the export earnings and to the creation of employment opportunities within Australia. It is an example that I would hope the government would see its way clear to follow in other industries and stands in marked contrast, as I said before, to its general policy of following an ideology of removing all tariffs, all bounties and all protection devices in the face of other countries not pursuing this particular path but doing everything they can to assist their industries. I trust that the government will see its way clear to use this example for other industries. The Australian Democrats will be supporting this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I echo many of the comments made by Senator Spindler. Whilst the Greens will be supporting the Bounty (Ships) Amendment Bill 1993, we feel that some of those people within the industry may feel like it is a choice between death by bullet or death by starvation. We agree to the bill because it enables some time for the shipbuilding industry to adjust to the effects of a reduction in the bounty that is currently paid. But it tends to be made necessary by the loss of government revenue caused by tariff reductions and the need to be consistent with the current blind faith in free trade. Neither has been assessed as to its social and economic implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask that, before we go so far that we cannot turn back, there is some attempt to assess the impact of the removal of both tariffs and bounties. Perhaps we should ask some questions. Are we gaining jobs? Are we becoming more efficient? What are the effects on our balance of trade and our balance of payments? This is often used as the reason for which we take these policy actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kind of information that is available in policy performance statements would help us a great deal, should we ever be given the chance to choose with regard to that great level playing field in the sky&mdash;the Uruguay Round of GATT. The Greens would suggest that perhaps, as we make great changes to our trade policies that will affect people as we go along, it would only make sense to assess whether they are achieving what they say they are achieving, so that we can make better decisions in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have spoken in support of the legislation. I will not delay the Senate for long. People have been brief in their contributions on the legislation; therefore, it would not be appropriate for me to be lengthy in my response. As at least some senators have indicated in their contributions, this legislation is a reflection of an election announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to extend the shipbuilding bounty in line with the general manufacturing industry tariff; that is, to reduce the rate at which the tariff is phased down. The legislation was introduced in the last session and we are proceeding with it here today with somewhat greater speed than we were until yesterday. I am grateful for that and I promise to say no more on that, as I caused enough trouble about that yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current legislation, as everybody knows, would have provided for the bounty to be reduced from 10 per cent to five per cent much more quickly. This would have been ahead of the average of the general manufacturing tariff. As a whole, it will reduce to five per cent from 1 July 1996. This is an industry that has been very successful. The legislation reflects the government's belief that Australia's builders in this area deserve at least the same backing from the government that other Australian manufacturers get while they tackle the competitive challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not divert to respond to the comments made by Senator Short and, in particular, Senator Spindler. I missed the last of Senator Spindler's comments while I was walking down to the chamber. But we have had these sorts of discussions in the past, and I will not reiterate them. I have to apologise to Senator Margetts. I missed the thrust of her comments. I will have a look at them in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and follow them up. I cannot respond intelligently because I heard only the last few words. I missed her contribution while I was walking down here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in the Senate we have diverse views about issues of tariffs, protection, assistance to industry and industry policy generally, I think we all share in the pleasure that a successful industry with strong export growth such as this provides.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to amend several acts: the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989, the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, the Radio Communications Act 1991 and the Telecommunications Act 1991. The amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act will allow Australia Post to operate a national change of address scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 92 of the act imposes a duty on Australia Post employees and persons performing duties for Australia Post not to disclose, among other things, affairs or personal particulars, including the address, of a person. By amending section 92 of the act, a customer's name and address will be able to be disclosed to other persons, organisations and classes of organisations where a customer consents in writing to the disclosure of the new address on a form available from Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This national change of address scheme will mean that, when customers shift address and advise Australia Post of their new address and/or request mail redirection, they can give consent&mdash;or not give consent&mdash;for their name and address to be disclosed. Obviously, this scheme will be of particular use to businesses and other users of Australia Post sending out large amounts of correspondence. However, the privacy of Australian citizens must be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All disclosures will be recorded by Australia Post and any information obtained through the scheme will be handled in accordance with information privacy principles as set out in the Privacy Act 1988. The coalition is satisfied with the privacy safeguards contained in the amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 and will therefore be supporting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 will require suppliers of telecommunications services to consult with law enforcement agencies about new technologies they are intending to introduce and assist agencies in carrying out their law enforcement responsibilities. More specifically, the amendments will impose conditions requiring suppliers of eligible services firstly to consult, in accordance with Austel directions, with Commonwealth, state and territory law enforcement agencies about proposals to use or to develop new technology in their telecommunications activities; and, secondly, to provide Commonwealth, state and territory officers and authorities such help as is reasonably necessary to enforce criminal law and laws imposing pecuniary penalties, to protect the public revenue and to safeguard national security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would be aware, the new GSM digital mobile telephone technology is currently being introduced in Australia. Telecom was the first to switch on its digital MobileNet service on 27 April. This new technology has many advantages, including the security of the network. As we all know, callers using the 018 network are not assured of the security of their calls. I might add that there have been some celebrated cases of security breaches in the past because people using sophisticated scanners can pick up private telephone conversations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, the new digital technology is far more secure. While calls from a digital mobile phone to an ordinary phone and calls which pass through a base station on their way to another digital mobile phone can still be bugged, calls from one digital mobile phone directly to another cannot currently be tapped. This is a feature that will make the digital mobile telephones more attractive than the current 018 service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, security agencies&mdash;including ASIO, the National Crime Authority, the Australian Federal Police and state police&mdash;are allowed to tap phone calls in certain circumstances. Concerns have been expressed by these security agencies that the new mobile telephone networks operated by Telecom, Optus and Vodaphone are so secure that existing technology does not allow them to monitor communications. It is interesting to note that the release of GSM digital technology to some Middle Eastern countries has been delayed because of concern that it would be too hard for intelligence agencies to intercept calls made on this network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these problems will be overcome in Australia. The government has announced that over the next two years $25 million will be spent to re-code and re-encrypt the A5 algorithm to enable law enforcement agencies to listen in&mdash;where they are authorised, of course. The end result will be a mobile telephone network which is virtually untappable by the general public, unlike the existing 018 service, but which will eventually be able to be tapped by our security agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, it would have been preferable if this money had been spent prior to the introduction of the digital GSM networks rather than being spent after the fact. The way the government has handled this issue means that criminals and others wishing to avoid officially authorised interceptions of their telephone calls have been handed a two-year loophole in which they can make calls undetected. Nevertheless, the coalition does not believe that the majority of the Australian public, which is not involved in criminal activity, should be denied access to the latest technology because of the government's lack of foresight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GSM mobile telephones will offer several advantages over the existing 018 service, including clearer voice quality, flexibility of use through access cards, longer battery life and the possibility of extending the service into direct data and facsimile transmissions. I note with some concern, however, that the ability to transmit data via a digital mobile phone will not occur as quickly as might have been implied by the publicity surrounding this new technology. The digital mobile phones on sale in Australia are phase one phones which cannot support data transmission and therefore cannot receive or send faxes or other vital information. I understand that phase two is required for data transfer and this will not be available until at least the middle of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also next year, I believe users of digital mobile phones will be able to use the roaming features of these phones. Users will be able to take their phones overseas and use them everywhere in Europe and in most of Asia, but not in America or Japan because their networks are based on different technologies. Of course, this feature will not be used by very many people&mdash;though perhaps some ministers on overseas trips might find the feature quite useful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 because now situations such as this will be avoided in the future. As a senator who is based in a rural area, I have noted with some interest that the new digital network will cover 55 per cent of Australian consumers but only those based in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, the Gold Coast, Newcastle, Geelong, and Victoria's Mornington Peninsular. The whole of the Northern Territory, including Darwin, is missing out as well as the rest of regional, rural and remote Australia. The O18 network presently covers 84 per cent of Australian consumers, and I hope the digital network will be expanded to achieve at least this level of coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 contained in the Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 reflect similar conditions imposed on the licences of the three telecommunications carriers&mdash;Optus, Telecom and Vodaphone&mdash;and the opposition will not be opposing these amendments. </PARA>

I know the minister is getting tired and wants to knock off, but I will very briefly address a couple of points that Senator Ferguson did not. The amendments to the Motor Vehicles Standards Act 1989 will correct some minor drafting errors in relation to the term `road vehicles'. Obviously it was just slack or sloppy drafting to merely refer to vehicles as `road vehicles' when we all know that some vehicles are not necessarily road vehicles. There are a few points in relation to penalties but I will not address them now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Motor Vehicle Standards Act has also been amended to provide for a penalty where conditions to import a non-standard condition are breached. No doubt permits are given to import vehicles that are not standard but are subject to bringing them up to standard. The main reason that these vehicles are not standard is that they are brought in for wrecking. When the sharp dealer gets such a vehicle, he decides to make a quick buck by putting it back on the road. </PARA>
<PARA>Vehicles should be dismantled if the import licence has been issued for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, vehicles are brought into Australia for transport, subject to modification. Penalties are put into place for the ones that do not make the modifications but which are still used for transport. I could not really see the reason for this provision in relation to licensing because such a vehicle surely would be picked up at inspection. What is the use of having any sort of vehicle, especially one that has been imported and has cost a reasonable amount of money, that will not pass licensing inspection?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, with your indulgence, Mr Acting Deputy President, I will just go back to another subject that was pretty topical at the time. I refer to former Senator Button's $12,000 tariff on imported second-hand Japanese cars. Intense lobbying by Australian motor dealers, especially second-hand motor dealers, convinced Senator Button at the time to bring in this $12,000 tariff on what were mostly imported second-hand Japanese cars. The cars were a maximum of five years old at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government might be ruing this move at present because it is driving out of business firms who operate in this field. I know of one firm in Perth which employed 300 employees and which was virtually closed down. The present budget contains measures to increase the price of leaded fuel to try to drive lead-using vehicles off the road, whereas by reducing the importation of vehicles which were a maximum of five years old and which already had unleaded engines, the government has held up the changeover to the use of unleaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia at present the average car is 10 years old, which means that the average car that is being driven around Australia is a 1983 model. I find that hard to believe but statistics show that that is right. So we have another four years to go before the average car in Australia is unleaded&mdash;based on the 1987 model. If Australia had continued to import those vehicles, the changeover to unleaded fuel would have happened faster. Senator Murphy is shaking his head, but I assure him that those suppositions are correct: the changeover would have occurred much more quickly. Of course, we would have had the cleaner air that the Australian Democrats and the Greens are always talking about, and that is a point worth making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that in the past couple of weeks the government has talked of taking off the $12,000 tariff on imported second-hand cars. I cannot see why Senator Murphy is shaking his head because it has been said that the government will take off this tariff. The businesses that imported such cars have been wrecked and driven out of business and it will take them a while to crank up. Perhaps the government has seen the folly of its ways, because we would have been in a far better position by now. We would have had cheaper second-hand cars and would have changed over much more quickly to unleaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the sooner the government takes off that tariff the better, so we can get back to some sense and give car dealers&mdash;whether new car dealers or second-hand car dealers&mdash;a bit of competition so that they can see what the real world is like. We support the bill, and in due course we will see what happens about Japanese second-hand cars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Murray-Darling Basin Bill 1993 provides for a revised Murray-Darling basin agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The agreement incorporates a salinity and drainage strategy to address the key problems of the River Murray, salinity and water logging, as well as a system of water allocation. Overall, the bill, which replaces the Murray-Darling Basin Act 1987, offers improved management of land, water and environmental resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the Murray-Darling basin covers more than a million square kilometres, virtually all of inland south-eastern Australia or approximately one-seventh of the continent. The annual value of the basin's primary and secondary production is about $10 billion a year with the area producing about half of Australia's agricultural and forestry output. The area also supports 25 per cent of Australia's cattle and dairy farms, about 50 per cent of its sheep, lambs and crop land, and almost 75 per cent of its irrigation land. Consequently, we have strong economic, cultural and environmental reasons for looking after this agricultural heartland, not to mention the future of the two million people who live within the basin catchment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1914, the first River Murray waters agreement was signed and the River Murray Commission established. It divided and regulated the river flow between the three states, a move important to South Australia at the bottom end of the river system. In 1987, the River Murray waters agreement, which established a ministerial council and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, was signed by New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth. Complementary legislation was passed by the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial council was set up to provide effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of water, land and environmental resources of the basin. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission was set up to assume regulatory responsibilities and act as an advisory body to the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling strategy aims to reduce average salinity levels in the Murray River by 20 per cent as well as drain and dispose of waste water on some 500,000 hectares of land affected by water logging and salinisation. I draw senators' attention to the 1992 annual report of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission and, in particular, to statistics on dry land salinity. According to the report, at least 200,000 hectares are grossly affected by dry land salinity while one million hectares are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1988, more than $74 million has been spent by governments on salt interception schemes and on joint government-community drainage and salinity management plans. Perhaps the most significant change to the Murray-Darling basin agreement is the inclusion of a salinity and drainage strategy. This has been achieved by intergovernmental cooperation, a process which now warrants legislative backing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amended agreement also provides for water allocation through a system of continuous water accounting. This will allow New South Wales and Victoria to draw on their annual water allocation according to need. Unused allocations will be carried forward as credits and, similarly, above allocation drawings will be carried forward as debits against future entitlements. The bill also gives the commission more financial flexibility by allowing the commission, with council approval, to carry over limited funds from one year to the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation empowers the ministerial council to modify the agreement through the approval of additional schedules to incorporate new strategies. I understand that following the successful passage of this bill, the first schedule brought forward for approval will be one authorising the addition of Queensland. There is also provision for the commission to have an independent president. The Commonwealth appoints two commissioners and two deputy commissioners, as do participating states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that this new agreement between the states and the Commonwealth allows the commission to take into account matters other than the quantity of water for farm irrigation. My colleague in the other place, the shadow minister for primary industry, John Anderson, recently called on the commission to allocate water for environmental purposes such as the regular watering of Murray River red gums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While environmentally conscious farmers are keen to undertake water and soil conservation works on their farms, many are hampered by the current economic circumstances and lack of resources. However, the existence of blue-green algae is a clear warning that Australian river systems are in trouble and we therefore have an obligation to develop ways of avoiding or dealing with such problems in the future. The federal opposition supports this bill and I join with my colleagues in commending the work of all those involved in the management of the Murray-Darling basin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats welcome the Murray-Darling Basin Bill 1993. We believe it will enhance the sustainable management of the Murray-Darling basin. I do not wish to spend a lot of time discussing the problems faced by the Murray-Darling basin. We all know what they are: acute salinity, drainage problems due to the clearance of hundreds of thousands of hectares of native bush throughout the basin, the overuse of water for irrigation purposes, poor water quality due to agricultural run-off and inadequate sewerage facilities along the river, blue-green algae problems, severe and long-term waterlogging, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does appear to address the central problem of water use and water quality in the Murray-Darling basin. It gives effect to the salinity and drainage strategy which is incorporated in the revised agreement. That agreement sets up a system of water entitlements. But here, with the whole management of the area, we see a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the system, water users are allowed to build up water credits or debits. In a wet year the total number of credits may not be consumed and the irrigator would then be allowed to carry over the credits to the following year. In a dry season, irrigators may overuse this water entitlement. A debit would then be carried forward into the successive year. This raises the possibility that water credits could be stored up and used in a dry season, causing damage to the river's health. However, I have been told that water credits relate to the water held in the weirs, not to the water level of the river itself. The commission is set to a minimum water level for each weir. Irrigators in New South Wales and Victoria would then be allowed to use their water allocations in a dry year but within the minimum level required in a weir. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now come to my main criticism of the revised agreement and, therefore, of this bill: it fails to deal with the guaranteed minimum environmental flow. The agreement sets out a system for the allocation of guaranteed minimum flows for irrigation users, but it does not set out a system for a guaranteed flow for the river itself. The allocation of a minimum flow to maintain the river's health lies at the very heart of the sustainable resource use in the Murray-Darling basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised agreement is still very anthropocentric. We really need to look first at what is necessary for the Murray-Darling to regain its health and integrity. Once that has been established, we can then look at what is left over for irrigation and other uses. But we are still doing it the other way around. Under the system established in this bill, the river still comes last. The question of environmental flow and the river's integrity is admittedly a very thorny one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that originally&mdash;before all the dams, weirs, locks and water diversions were constructed&mdash;the river's flow was extremely erratic. During a dry season, the river in some areas would stop flowing altogether. The river would become a series of disconnected waterholes. These were highly saline and contained a concentrated density of freshwater species. When the rains came, the flowing river would return and the highly saline waterholes would be flushed through with fresh water. The species in the river system adapted to this highly variable environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The river today is radically different. It is a network of interconnected lakes characterised by predictable water flows. The rhythms of flood and drought have been lost. This loss is irreversible. So, when we talk about maintaining or regaining the integrity of the river or about protecting the river's health, we are really talking about an increased flow for the river, rather than resurrecting the river's natural rhythms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, an increased flow for the river is extremely important. It is shocking to realise that only about one-third of the total volume of the river flows into the sea; about two-thirds is used or stored for human use. When we add to this the problems of salinity and pollution, we can see why the river is in such a sorry state. It is simply not being flushed with clean water. Salinity problems therefore become permanent, rather than a transitory feature of the river. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I considered the idea of moving a second reading amendment to require the Murray-Darling Basin Commission to allocate water entitlements to the river itself; in other words, a guaranteed minimum flow. But an amendment would not have been accepted due to the fact that the legislation implements an agreement signed between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, and because the states have already introduced complementary legislation. I decided not to go ahead with a second reading amendment because I have been informed that the ministerial council is already addressing this issue and there may well be a schedule developed down the track to deal with the matters I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue I would like to touch on is that of the role of trees in helping to prevent salinity. I was pleased to see in the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) last year a commitment to the funding of a national corridor of green along the Murray River as well as a number of other clean water initiatives. I was pleased to see that the government had provided further funding for the program in the budget&mdash;and it is one of the few commendable things that the government put in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of trees as nature's engineering works is finally being recognised by the Murray-Darling basin ministerial council. Trees have the capacity to lower rising saline watertables and to improve the soil structure along the river. They have many other benefits, such as improving biodiversity and providing shade and shelter to livestock and wind breaks to crops. I hope that the government will continue to fund this program which is so important to the health of the Murray for longer than the four years promised in the statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Queenslander, I am glad to see that the Queensland government has finally adopted a cooperative approach to the management of the Murray-Darling basin. Given that approximately a quarter of the basin lies in Queensland, including the headwaters of the Darling River, integrated management of the area is simply not achievable without Queensland coming to the party. The premier has now signed a schedule for the accession of Queensland to the agreement. I expect that the Murray-Darling basin ministerial council will speedily approve the schedule once this bill becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the last point I want to make: the bill allows for greater legislative flexibility in dealing with changes to the Murray-Darling basin agreement. The ministerial council from now on will be able to approve schedules to the agreement. I see no problem with this process. The ministerial council is clearly moving towards a more integrated and environmentally responsible approach to the management of the basin. I am happy to say that the Democrats fully support this bill. We have no amendments to propose. </PARA>

So it is good to see that we have the Australian Democrats as well as the government and the opposition all agreeing with this particular bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised agreement incorporates a salinity and drainage strategy which addresses the dual problems of salinity and waterlogging, particularly in the upper Murray reaches.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, following the successful passage of this bill, the first schedule to be brought forward for approval will be one authorising the assent of Queensland to this agreement. This is significant because all states that are part of this system will now become party to this agreement; for example, Senator Woodley pointed out to us the significance of the Queensland head water system. This is important because this is a vital resource for this country and it is extremely important in terms of its agricultural productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling system covers more than one million square kilometres&mdash;virtually all of inland south-eastern Australia and approximately one-seventh of the entire continent. The river system is one of the longest in the world, draining a region 1,450 kilometres long and 1,000 kilometres wide. Three-quarters of New South Wales, my state, is located in the vicinity of the basin, as is well over half of Victoria, 15 per cent of Queensland and seven per cent of South Australia. It also includes the entire Australian Capital Territory. Canberra, interestingly enough, is the largest centre of population of this basin. Altogether, nearly two million people live within the basin's catchment, and a large number of people outside the catchment region are supported by its resources. The annual value of production in this basin in the areas of primary and secondary industry is about $10 billion, which accounts for about 30 to 40 per cent of the total production from Australia's natural resource based industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that the basin is of immense importance as an employer and a creator of wealth for the whole of Australia. Half of our crop land is included in this basin. Half of our sheep flock and one-quarter of the beef and dairy cattle are in the basin's region. From these statistics we can see that the basin is critical for the future of Australian agriculture, for the many jobs it creates and for our wealth. It is, therefore, disturbing that in a continent like Australia, which I remind the Senate is the driest continent in the world, this whole area is at considerable risk through the way in which we have managed the land over the last 200 years. We have one of the most fragile soil systems in the world and we have incredible problems with salinity in much of this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One projection is that if this is not treated properly this area could become a desert within 90 years. This has happened in other areas of the world. It has happened in the areas around the Nile and in the areas in Iraq around the Tigris and the Euphrates. The Murray-Darling system is no exception. We have to be very careful in our future management of land resources. We really need to work on the ways in which we have damaged the land to date and to introduce a number of corrective strategies. That is why legislation such as this, particularly as it is a cooperative effort between the states and the federal government, is so important. It is the reason why the River Murray waters agreement was originally conceived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 this agreement, which established the ministerial council and the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, was signed by New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Commonwealth. Complementary legislation was passed shortly afterwards by the states. Under the agreement the ministerial council was provided with effective planning and management for the equitable, efficient and sustainable use of water, land and environmental resources in the basin, while the Murray-Darling Basin Commission was to assume regulatory responsibilities and to act as an advisory body to the ministerial council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling strategy aims to reduce the average salinity levels in the Murray River by 20 per cent and at the same time to drain and dispose of waste water on some 500,000 hectares of land affected by salination and waterlogging.

Firstly, the purpose of the Murray-Darling Basin Bill is to give effect to a revised Murray-Darling Basin agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and now, as a result of at least part of the amendments in this bill, Queensland. It is to ensure and improve management of the land, water and environmental resources of the Murray-Darling Basin. This agreement builds on the first River Murray waters agreement in 1914, so this legislation itself is building on the original agreement. It is Australia's most important agricultural region and is a major focus of the government's approach to achieving sustainable resource use.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this region has been well outlined by Senator Tierney, Senator Woodley and Senator Tambling. I thank them for their support of this legislation. I want to respond to two matters that Senator Woodley mentioned. The first is algal blooms. I think we are all aware of the extensive outbreaks of blooms along reaches of the Darling River in November of 1991. Following those outbreaks, the Murray-Darling Basin Commission established a special committee to provide direction in developing policy to combat these types of outbreaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft algal management strategy was approved by the council of government ministers at its 25 June 1993 meeting. That is being distributed for public consultation and will be finalised at the next council meeting, scheduled for November of this year. As a further step towards removing one of the sources of nutrients responsible for the blooms in the basin, Minister Crean announced that he would approach the states to undertake a joint program to upgrade sewage treatment facilities in the key Murray-Darling towns to remove the phosphate, which is a principal cause of the algal blooms. The second matter that Senator Woodley mentioned&mdash;and I certainly share his concern&mdash;was some of the practices in the allocation of water whereby in a particularly wet year the surplus water can be carried over to the next year, which may be a dry year. That is the theory, but in practice the water may not be there to carry over. There is a need to establish a practice whereby there is a total allocation of waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Woodley pointed out, that criticism is recognised as having validity. The current commission has looked at the issue and commenced at Barmah-Millewa a new water management program to examine ways of counteracting this problem. In this area, 100 gigalitres&mdash;I understand that a gigalitre is 10(9) litres, something else I have learnt tonight&mdash;of water has been allocated as the total available water in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not appropriate to put that sort of detail in this legislative package. It is up to the commission to establish the programs within the framework of this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 abolishes the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council and replaces it with the new Australian Pig Industry Council. Apart from setting up a more effective version of the council, the bill also amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act and the Meat Research Corporation Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years the federal government has established a range of advisory councils for primary industries to inquire, review and report on the strategic direction of their industry. Generally these councils have consisted of producers, processors and other interested parties and have been funded entirely by the government. Unlike these councils, the Pig Industry Policy Council was financed solely by pork producers. Regarded by many as ineffective, the council will be replaced by a new body which will report to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, include other sectors of the industry and consequently receive government funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues in the other place have already commended the pork industry as a great Australian rural industry, an industry which directly employs more than 4,300 workers and indirectly creates 7,200 jobs. The industry is also an important consumer of domestic grain. In fact, 1.5 million tonnes of grain are consumed by the Australian pork industry alone. I understand the value at the farm gate is more than $700 million per year. On those figures alone, the pork industry deserves its status as a great rural industry and is yet another example of the way in which the rural sector can create jobs and wealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy reviewed the Australian Pig Industry Policy Council in 1991 and recommended that its membership reflect sectors with direct investment in the industry. The review also found insufficient work on export orientation, a need to increase technology and a need to rationalise the processing sector. It reported that if the council were brought under the Primary Industry Council Act it would be better able to consider these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this plan, the chairperson will be appointed by the government. There will be three people nominated by the Pork Council of Australia which represents producers, one from the Meat and Allied Trades Federation, one from the National Meat Processors Association, as well as the chairman of each of the Australian Pork Corporation and the Pig Research and Development Corporation. The composition aims to represent those with a direct or indirect interest in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also amends the Pig Industry Act 1986 to recognise the Pork Council of Australia as the eligible representative producer body. The federal coalition welcomes the change because the Pork Council of Australia has well represented the pork producers of this nation. The Pork Council superseded the Australian Pork Producers Federation in March this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable senators may be aware of criticism of the voting arrangement for the annual general meeting of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation and the Meat Research Corporation. Much of the criticism focused on the requirement for a 75 per cent vote to overturn a levy motion put by a corporation. In reality, no levy motion put before an annual general meeting could be overturned. The amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act and the Meat Research Corporation Act will allow a simple majority to pass resolutions at annual meetings or a two-thirds majority for no confidence motions, but will require at least 50 per cent of the votes cast on the two producer registers and 50 per cent of the votes cast on the processors register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw to the attention of honourable senators the amendment relating to the Grain Industry Council to ensure that its member from the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia Ltd is from its recently constituted food committee. The federal coalition will not oppose the amendments that were moved in the other place and, for the record, the federal coalition acknowledges the need for review and trusts that these new arrangements are the most efficient for the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are discussing the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. Provisions of this bill are largely non-contentious and the Australian Democrats will be supporting the bill. Other senators have detailed the amendments contained in the bill. I do not propose to take up the Senate's time going over those again. However, I would like to briefly pick up on a comment made by Mr Andrew, the Liberal member for Wakefield, during the House of Representatives debate on this bill on 18 August. Defending the coalition's stance on tariffs he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those who do not know, let me spell it out: because the nation has no choice, there is no real difference between the attitudes that the ALP and the Coalition take to the difficult and vexed question of protecting Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the policy direction of the government and the coalition is the same. They take us down the same path. I will restrain myself because there is a lot I would like to say on that, but suffice it to say that the Australian Democrats have great problems with the policies of both the government and the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes changes to the pig and meat industries. Honourable senators will recall that in June of this year, the Canadian government imposed a 25 per cent tariff on Australian beef. At the same time Canada was exporting subsidised pork into this country. The fact that Canada is a member of the Cairns Group, which supposedly promotes more free agricultural trade, shows clearly that other nations are not about to embrace the free market, level playing field with the great fervour and enthusiasm that Australia seems to be. We simply cannot afford to be the world leaders in the reduction of tariffs. We await the day when the government and the coalition agree with the Australian Democrats on this issue and commit themselves to a more enlightened path. In the meantime, we support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Baume. I confess to being rather surprised when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, without any explanation to its readers, decided to drop his column. I have been told that surveys showed his column had been one of the better read sections of that newspaper. Perhaps the controversies surrounding the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> article will encourage the editors of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> to restore his column.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I met Manning Clark very briefly some years before he died when he was a guest lecturer at Ormond College, University of Melbourne. However, I would certainly not claim to have known him. My late father knew him well at the university, where they played cricket together in the university XI. My father described him as a likeable and warm person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not plan to canvass all the issues which have been raised by Peter Ryan in his article entitled `Manning Clark'. Rather, I wish to comment briefly on some aspects of the debate which impact on the political arena and which illustrate how intellectual debate is conducted in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, Manning Clark is one of the few remaining icons of the Left in Australia. I have no doubt that Manning Clark's view of Australia has profoundly influenced the Labor Party and, not the least, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). This is not to suggest that the Prime Minister has read Manning Clark's histories; no-one would ever accuse the Prime Minister of reading a book. However, there is no doubt that the members of the chattering classes that surround Mr Keating have absorbed Manning Clark's view and vision of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit to being surprised that so little has been said in defence of Manning Clark by Labor politicians in this parliament, particularly, as Peter Ryan observes, `It was beyond Manning Clark to be disobliging to the Australian Labor Party, especially in his later years'. It is true that Mr Keating's writers recently strung a few cliches together in order to at least mount some defence of Manning Clark. This is what Mr Keating said in defence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Manning Clark's great achievement was to imagine Australia&mdash;what it was and what it might become&mdash;and he did it so well he helped us all to do it. It is not Manning Clark's politics which some conservative Australians object to. His politics were hardly radical. And it's not the way he wrote history&mdash;the way is always open to anyone who wants to write it better.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is true. Mr Keating continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What they fear is imagination.</PARA>
<PARA>With an intellectual contribution like that regurgitated by the Prime Minister, the Left truly has problems!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am aware, Lindsay Tanner, the honourable member for Melbourne, is the only Labor senator or member who has sprung to Manning Clark's defence in the parliament. He made a brief speech on the adjournment debate, suggesting that Peter Ryan's criticisms were politically motivated. But I thought he failed to deal with any of the substantive points which Peter Ryan made in his article. As far as I can see, that is all that has been said in this parliament on the great debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party may have an excuse in that it has been somewhat distracted in recent weeks. However, I suggest that there may be a deeper reason for Labor's silence. It reflects an inability to come to terms with the criticisms which have been made. I do not suggest that this reflects any lack of affection for Manning Clark on the Labor side of politics. However, a substantive defence of Manning Clark would have to recognise that his vision of Australia is not one which engenders national pride, confidence in the Australian character and Australian institutions. By and large, Australia's heroes are not Manning Clark's heroes. Nevertheless, it is true that Manning Clark's influence on the Labor Party continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the great issues of the day which the Prime Minister has embraced with great vigour&mdash;republicanism and Mabo&mdash;reflect a view of history that is consistent with Clark's vision of Australia. The first, republicanism, reflects Manning Clark's supreme distaste for the British and their influence on Australian history and institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember being somewhat surprised when I read Manning Clark's article in a special edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS> which was produced in 1988 to mark the first 200 years of Australian history. The vitriol with which Manning Clark described our British origins seemed, I felt, quite out of place with the occasion and, I suspect, with the feelings of ordinary Australians. In that article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time</EMPHASIS>, Manning Clark said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the coming of the British was the occasion of three great evils: the violence against the original inhabitants of the country . . . the violence against the first European labour force in Australia, the convicts; and the violence done to the land itself.</PARA>
<PARA>This is just one view of our past. I suspect that most Australians have a more balanced view of their history. They recognise, as indeed they should, the continuing tragedy of Aboriginal Australians. Yet they believe that their ancestors laid the foundations for one of the world's most tolerant, democratic and prosperous societies&mdash;a society where, truly, Jack is as good as his master. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manning Clark, however, highlights the negatives in Australian history, often at the expense of our great positives. This is sheer manna for the Left, but is it reality and does it reflect the sentiment of ordinary Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's attitude to Mabo and Aboriginal policy expresses the need to recompense for the guilt which Clark attributed. The error of the Left is to think in terms of class and race rather than of the needs of individual people. After all, as the founders of our federation said under the one great slogan, we are one people with one destiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I suspect that Manning Clark in many ways exemplifies the black armband view of Australian history. As Peter Ryan says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If our history were really as black as Clark so wickedly paints it, children would just have to face it. But in fact, Australia's fortunes went up and went down; we won some and we lost some; history is simply life writ large. The great depressions of the 1890s and the 1930s were painful times, but for all that we once enjoyed the highest standard of living on the globe, and amazed the rest of the world with our bold political and social progress. Few of the original convicts wanted to go back home, and today people queue up at Australian embassies the world over, seeking to migrate here. The Australian experience of life for ordinary people has not lacked its rough patches, but by the standards of comparison which the real world allows, it has been unrivalled in its spaciousness and freedom. And these are the people whom Clark portrays not merely as losers but <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">destined</EMPHASIS> to be losers.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that Manning Clark's history and his view of Australia is able to answer some of the central questions about our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that Australia can claim a longer continuous democratic history than virtually all other nations? What is it in our national character that must be nurtured to ensure that this great democratic tradition continues? What is it in our national character which promotes and, at times, inhibits our economic prosperity? As a historian heavily influenced by a Marxist view of the world, Manning Clark has little to offer on this issue. Why is it that the religious, national and racial tensions of the old world have always found it very difficult to find fertile soil in Australia? I believe that one will look in vain at Manning Clark's histories for the answers to these sorts of questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter on which I wish to comment this evening. One of the most significant statements in Peter Ryan's article highlights the lack of intellectual courage amongst our academics. Peter Ryan suggests that Clark's history was given a free run and was `largely exempt from criticism by many of our most rigorous scholarly minds'. He continues in his article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the time Volume V was published in 1981 this approached the proportions of a professional scandal. Quadrant, for example, asked five of Australia's leading historians to review it and received five more or less identical replies.</PARA>
<PARA>Summed up, these replies said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it's a terrible book but you can't expect me to say that in print. Such a floodtide of general approbation was running that few dared stand against it.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper summed it up rather well a couple of weeks ago when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ryan successfully shows that the historians and reviewers of Clark's volumes lacked sufficient intellectual courage to assess his history properly. There was always a small, dwindling number of critics. But, by and large, Clark became an Australian icon and was treated with reverence, not rigour. Ryan has broken the cycle, and it should stay broken. It is time for a new debate on Australian history to begin.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper also welcomed the beginning of the debate on Clark's histories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat ironic that the cartoon drawn by the cartoonist Petty in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper at the same time reflected a desire of the Left to keep Clark above criticism. In one of the most distasteful cartoons I have seen for a long time, the cartoonist, Petty, suggests that Ryan's article is somewhat similar to the burning of the books by Hitler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to some of the central features of Australian society which Manning Clark failed to adequately acknowledge or explain. I believe that one of the great strengths of our society has been the suspicion that the typical Australian has for intellectuals. How else did Australia stand out against the tide of socialism which was running so strongly in so many other countries just after the Second World War?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The academics&mdash;almost to a man and woman in the universities&mdash;embraced this philosophy in the key departments. The Australian people did not listen to them. They turned in a different direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Paul Johnson, in his book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Intellectuals</EMPHASIS>, sums up the attitude that Australians often have to those in universities and academia. This is what Paul Johnson says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think I detect today a certain public scepticism when intellectuals stand up to preach to us, a growing tendency among ordinary people to dispute the right of academics, writers and philosophers, eminent though they may be, to tell us how to behave and conduct our affairs . . . A dozen people picked at random on the street are at least as likely to offer sensible views on moral and political matters as a cross-section of the intelligentsia.</PARA>
<PARA>Manning Clark's histories have had a profound effect on the Labor Party. For the reasons which Paul Johnson has stated, they have had significantly less effect amongst ordinary Australians. I do not believe that Australians by and large share, nor ever will they, the Manning Clark vision of this country. The Labor Party will forget this at its peril. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise tonight what I believe to be not simply the scandal of the piggery interests of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in itself but the manner in which much of the media has been terrorised by the Prime Minister out of reporting it. In particular, I want to talk about the standover tactics, harassment of the media, sackings of individual journalists, silencing of critics and attacks on credibility and professional standing of those journalists who have been brave enough to dare to tell the truth about the Prime Minister's piggery interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will begin with a matter that many in this chamber would not feel is significant. It is a simple matter of, if you like, a permanent part-time radio journalist in the Hunter Valley who dared to run an article about pollution from the Prime Minister's half-owned piggery at Scone. For the sake of completeness, I should mention that, as a result of my inquiries and for no other reason, the Senate and the people of Australia are at last aware that what Mr Keating described as an interest in a company which had an interest in a piggery was in fact half ownership of a company that owned several piggeries along with a refrigeration company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those companies had filed false, misleading, inadequate and massively late returns with the Australian Securities Commission, having the effect of totally misleading those people who, for perhaps business or other reasons, wanted to know what the financial status of the Prime Minister's half-owned companies really were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not simply the media who reported what I was doing that has been subjected to the sort of harassment, attack and personal abuse that is certainly well known in this parliament. The Editor of the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> found this out when it dared to run an article on this issue. The Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> was then banned, according to the Prime Minister, from his press briefings for a while. That did not last too long because it was the typical arrogant response one would expect that was simply not capable of being continued in the rational light of day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has happened not just to the people who have written the facts that I have provided relating to the accounts that are based on the returns filed with the Australian Securities Commission. It has happened to a permanent part-time journalist on the ABC news. On 29 January this year ABC news ran a story on the concerns of Hunter Valley residents about pollution of local water supplies caused by the Prime Minister piggery. The journalist reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Residents near a upper Hunter piggery in which Prime Minister Paul Keating has a half share want him to investigate what they say is dangerously inadequate effluent disposal.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to identify the journalist. The journalist continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the residents say the company is reckless in its disregard for the animals and the damage being caused to local water supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parkville Piggery environmental watch group led by Peter Hodges says raw effluent from the facility is threatening water supplies in Scone, Aberdeen and perhaps even Muswellbrook. Mr Hodges says he and the other residents feel deserted by the regulatory authorities which are ignoring the piggery's non-compliance with codes of practice relating the pig industry. He says pigs are being kept on an area of about 50 hectares when the code recommends about one thousand and the animals are restricted to the same paddocks for up to seven months at a time, saturating the soil with waste. Mr Hodges says the Prime Minister must take some responsibility. Well I think he should listen to the people on the ground yes and not just through reps of his company. . . a damn good look at his piggery.</PARA>
<PARA>The result was that the ABC broadcast an apology. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management of the Parkville Piggery, in which the Prime Minister has an interest&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I love the way it is diminished. Half ownership becomes `an interest', once again because that is the way the Prime Minister chooses to describe half ownership. The apology continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has rejected claims, made in ABC news broadcast last Friday, that it was responsible for causing pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allegations, made by a local residents group, were made without reference to the management of the Piggery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report did not contain a response from the Piggery's management, and the ABC accepts their response that the Piggery's operations do not breach codes of practice, relating to water pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, enquiries with regulatory authorities reveal no evidence exists to suggest the operation is responsible for causing such pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC apologises to the management of the Piggery for any embarrassment caused by the report.</PARA>
<PARA>What a great grovel that is! What are the facts? The fact is that the aforementioned story on the piggery resulted in a threat of legal action against the ABC by Mr Keating's half owned piggery company. I understand the ABC admitted liability for defamation and settled with the claimant for an undisclosed sum. I would like to know how much the piggery company got out of the ABC for a story that was correct. I will demonstrate how correct it was in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certain legal opinion that I have seen that suggests that no defamation could be sustained by the claimant at law. No attempt was made by the ABC lawyers to consult the reporter of the story in order to obtain relevant factual and contextual background. One would think that consultation like that would be normal. One would also think that it is especially important that an admission of liability by the ABC would have profound legal implications for the journalists and the ABC itself, irrespective of the ability of the ABC to defend itself with public funds or to make settlements like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the facts? The environmental impact statement put out by Danpork Australia Pty Ltd&mdash;the company that Mr Keating's half-owned company has now joined in a multimillion  dollar  joint  venture&mdash;says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current piggery operations impact on the environment in three main areas:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">odour from the pig sheds and waste treatment system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil; and,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">accumulation of nitrate in the groundwater.</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC apologised and said, `There is no pollution; how terrible. We grovel and apologise'. The environmental impact statement further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These impacts are the result of an operation which was set up under the best advice of the day but has since been superseded.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to explain how the wonderful new things that it will do under the great expansion program will fix things up. There is a clear admission of pollution from this piggery at the time an ABC journalist was sacked following a situation where a grovelling apology was run by the ABC. It is clear that improper pressure was imposed on the media and resulted in a withdrawal of a statement that was correct and quite proper and the sacking of a journalist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me to the general question, which I have not dealt with in the past, about pollution and how extraordinary the handling of this whole matter has been. It also interests me that Mr Peter Ryan, who was mentioned earlier, was also suddenly without his job as a columnist on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> after asking 10 questions of the Prime Minister relating to the piggery. Is it not remarkable the way people who dare question the Prime Minister's piggery end up jobless? There are a couple of other people who have lost their jobs for being brave enough to take on the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose one should not criticise too strongly the organisations that have dismissed people for all sorts of other reasons. I suppose it is an expensive hobby to attract this kind of legal attack by the Prime Minister. I know that only too well. I have just paid a solicitor's bill for some very good advice on some matters in which the company and Mr Keating have taken action against me, or are saying that they are going to take action against me. But the legal action is not on these specific matters that I am detailing here, so there is no question of sub judice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the question of the environmental benefits or otherwise of this piggery in the Hunter Valley has not received much of an airing&mdash;and I use the word loosely&mdash;in this chamber. I understand that the Environmental Protection Authority will be responding to the environmental impact statement put out by the Danpork consortium which wants to massively expand the Parkville Piggery in the Hunter Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Danpork has lodged a development application with the Scone Council to expand the piggery from 2,400 to 10,000 sows and to build a meat processing plant catering for 600,000 pigs a year. At a meeting in Scone only last week, the Mayor of Scone, Councillor Rose, said that there were concerns raised about the capacity of the developers to deliver the water needed for the project; various other environmental effects caused by effluent, which is high in nitrogen, phosphorous and sodium, were raised; and the capacity of the developer to rectify the problems caused some discussion. It is interesting that the Environmental Protection Authority has already said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the proposed site has obvious limitations for a conventional development on the issues of odour and waste management&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>one would not know that from listening to the ABC apologise for an issue that it should not have&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">but the proponent has stated that it is his intention to implement state of the art technology to address these limitations; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the environmental management of a 10,000 sow piggery and associated abattoir at the Parkville site will need to be exceptional in order to minimise odour generation.</PARA>
<PARA>The issues that the EPA was concerned about were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.identification of groundwater resources that may be potentially impacted by the proposal;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.determination of the level of protection required for the groundwater resources;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.details of the control measures to achieve the protection of groundwaters; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.details of carcass disposal, including contingency plans for mass mortalities.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the EPA considers that, if the piggery is to be expanded in a conventional manner, then the emission of odours could not be managed and controlled satisfactorily, and that the consequential impacts on the environment would be unacceptable to the community. In these circumstances the EPA would recommend that development consent be refused on these grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EPA cannot yet provide an opinion on whether odour emissions, given best available technology, could be managed and controlled satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA>All this came out before the journalist wrote that there were some environmental problems, and yet the ABC apologised. I will be fascinated to learn what happens when the matter comes before a commission of inquiry in New South Wales on 28 September. I will be interested to see what the Environmental Protection Authority's response is to the latest environmental impact statement. That can be inspected in Scone or in Sydney from 21 September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have every confidence in this commission of inquiry. I believe it will be a fair and proper commission of inquiry. But I am concerned that there are real problems which have to be resolved. A preliminary report from very reputable consultants engaged by the local residents shows some major problems in the environmental impact statement that Danpork has put out. For example, it says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply incorrect to describe nitrate concentrations of 24-54 mg/L&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">compared with non-detectable background concentrations, as `minor' groundwater contamination. It is serious contamination, amounting to pollution in the case of Bore 8; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statement that `the proposed development is likely to allow improvement of the groundwater condition at the site and reduce the likely-hood of off-site contamination migration to Kingdon Ponds' is not justified.</PARA>
<PARA>I spoke to these consultants. They say that the environmental problems are major concerns which, in their view, are not adequately dealt with in the environmental impact statement. In another report, the Environmental Protection Authority states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given this background and if the proposed development were to proceed the EPA expects that there will be a definite potential for odour complaints.</PARA>
<PARA>Remember that this involves a great collection of piggery units extending back towards Scone, which is certainly putting Scone within the eight kilometre safety area which is supposed to apply to major piggeries. Of course, the threat to tourism and so on in the area in that event would be very significant. That is why the EPA places great importance on siting guidelines. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preliminary estimates by NSW Agriculture indicate that the site would be unable to accommodate the expected nutrient load . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of contour irrigation on the `high country' does not conform with EPA guidelines on irrigation of wastewaters . . . To be acceptable to the EPA the proponent would have to demonstrate that effluent utilisation by pastures is effective and that the pollution of waters would not result.</PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The environmental management of a 10,000 sow piggery and associated abattoir at the Parkville site will need to be exceptional in order to minimise odour generation and to prevent land degradation and water pollution resulting from the on-site utilisation of wastes. There is inadequate suitable land to effectively utilise, or environmentally acceptably dispose, abattoir and piggery wastes.</PARA>
<PARA>All of this is coming out although the ABC apologises for daring to suggest that there may be some pollution problems. Of course, the locals have been protesting non-stop about this. I certainly do not want to say anything that would discourage any organisation&mdash;if it does not do this kind of apparent damage locally to the environment and to other industries&mdash;from setting out on a proposal that would advance Australia's capacity to earn export income. That is why I raise for the first time in this chamber the question of the environmental problems generated by this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I want to stress is that, if we have the same sort of standover tactics that have been used against the media in this whole question&mdash;the threats of legal action, the actual taking of legal action, the sacking of journalists and so on&mdash;then I would hope that none of that sort of thing will interfere in the proper process being undertaken in New South Wales. I hope it will proceed only if the proper concerns of the residents and the requirements of the Environmental Protection Authority are fully met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This takes me to another matter; that is, the unsatisfactory resolution of the problems I have raised dealing with the breaches of the Corporations Act by this group. Mr Hartnell, the then chairman of the Australian Securities Commission, wrote to me on 26 November last year, assuring me that if any contraventions of the corporations law by the Brown and Hatton group of companies&mdash;they are the ones, honourable senators will recall, that are half-owned by Mr Keating&mdash;were uncovered by the examination that the Securities Commission was to undertake at my request, the ASC would take appropriate action. Since then I have not been advised of any action whatsoever, if any, that has been taken by the ASC&mdash;apart from requesting that they file decent returns at last&mdash;over clear and undeniable breaches of corporations law and reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received no further correspondence. Apart from a telephone conversation that I instigated with Mr Hartnell's successor, in which I got no indication of any intended action, I have no knowledge of any action on my request of 13 November that the Australian Securities Commission examine the group's breaches of the law that I had outlined in the parliament to that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I officially know, as a result of searches of corporate records, is that the Brown and Hatton group of companies had to make extensive corrections to their false and misleading company returns for the years to June 1990 and 1991. The companies were forced by my actions eventually to submit the audited returns required by law. These showed that there were multi-million dollar understatements of losses and multi-million dollar overstatements of financial strength of the companies as measured by their shareholders' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The auditors reports, which were eventually and reluctantly submitted, revealed that five of the seven of the group's companies could  only survive with the support of the Commowealth Bank because they were technically insolvent with liabilities exceeding their assets&mdash;a fact concealed in the false returns to the Australian Securities Commission that remained unchallenged by the ASC until I raised these matters in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the point of having requirements for companies&mdash;in this case with assets allegedly totalling $30 million or so&mdash;to report when company directors tell lies in them and the owners of the companies have a reckless indifference as to whether or not lies have been told, and appear to do nothing to correct these lies even after they have been outlined in this parliament? There are no sanctions imposed by the regulators on this kind of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When proper company reports are not filed for years after their due date and are falsely claimed to have been presented at annual general meetings allegedly held months previously, and when false and misleading excuses are made by company directors to the Securities Commission for this contemptuous treatment of corporations law, no action is taken. At the same time, thousands of secretaries of small family companies struggling to survive in the recession that we had to have are being fined for failing to file their piddling reports on time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A letter dated 29 July last year from the Securities Commission to a constituent of mine at Parkville, the location of Mr Keating's half-owned Parkville piggery near Scone in New South Wales, in response to her request for access to Brown and Hatton's 1990 annual return&mdash;that is, more than a year after balance date&mdash;said that the Securities Commission had written to the company demanding that it resubmit its grossly inadequate 1990 annual return. This letter in July 1992 went on to say that any 1991 returns&mdash;that is not 1990 returns which they had not filed properly, but 1991&mdash;not lodged by August would receive penalty notices, and if no response then either legal action or deregistration would follow. </PARA>
<PARA>A correct 1990 annual return was not lodged for this group until December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to know is: did a penalty go out to the group? If not, why not? There were clear breaches and a compliance program was allegedly under way involving penalties, but nothing apparently happened to this group. Was it because of a ludicrous and deceptive letter written to the Securities Commission on 21 December 1992 by Mr Constantinidis, who signed it as Director of Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd and who is Mr Keating's 50 per cent partner in the group? This letter pretends that the uncontested breaches of the law&mdash;that is, failures to lodge audited returns as required; ridiculously late returns; inadequate returns and false returns&mdash;were because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . accounts previously lodged by the company with the Commission for the years 1990 and 1991 were prepared and signed by the former directors and then principals of the company, before their resignation in August 1991. The present directors did not enquire further into those accounts until questioned by the Commission on them. It now appears that the former principal directors misunderstood some accounting principles of consolidation which, with some minor typographical errors, led to inaccuracies in the accounts previously lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The writer became a principal shareholder of the company after the accounts were settled by the former principals. Once the company was notified by the Commission of these inaccuracies steps were immediately taken to rectify them. In this regard the company lodged draft audited accounts with the Commission recently. These accounts were lodged as a sign of good faith by the company to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>They happen to be false, and when audited accounts came out later they were shown to be false. Nonetheless, that is their indication of good faith. The letter pretends a whole series of things because the writer of the letter, Mr Constantinidis, is shown in the annual return for 1990 as a director and he was also the only ordinary shareholder, the only shareholder with full powers. The other shareholders, described as the previous principals, only had redeemable preference shares at that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unaudited 1990 annual return and accounts are not signed by anyone, but Mr Constantinidis himself did sign the lodgment sheet. He also signed the original proprietary company return, which was totally inadequate and did not meet the law. Mr Constantinidis has signed these returns that he says were inadequate because the previous owners did not understand. Is he saying that he did not tell himself that he did not know he had not filled in the forms properly, even though he was a qualified accountant and had previously been manager at the major accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick in Sydney?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Constantinidis falsely claims that he became a principal shareholder after the accounts for 1990 and 1991 were settled by the former principal, but he was the only ordinary shareholder with full entitlements and he signed the forms covering these accounts. Mr Constantinidis signed the 1991 accounts and is listed as a director&mdash;accounts he now says were wrong because the former directors did not understand. Some of the false returns were filed as late as December 1992, just a few days before he sent this letter to the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter is a travesty. I cannot understand how it could be accepted by the Securities Commission as enough to justify not proceeding against this group for clear and blatant breaches of the corporations law, particularly breaches involving massive overstatements of its assets and multi-million dollar understatements of the losses of various members of the group. The so-called apology&mdash;if one can call it an apology&mdash;that Mr Constantinidis has made to the Australian Securities Commission is, in effect, an insulting gesture. What astounds me is that it has been accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that I have not heard from the Securities Commission about these enormous breaches of the act that have taken place. I suppose some members of the government will say, `That is because these breaches happen every day and, in any event, you can't say it was because the Prime Minister was involved because he has taken no interest'. In fact, the Prime Minister had in fact a massive indifference to the question of whether or not these returns were proper. No action was taken in correcting these things until the ASC itself approached the companies as a result of my request. The group has basically admitted in this letter that it was only after the ASC approached the group that it set out to fix these things up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had many discussions with leading accountants in this country who tell me that the accounts are an absolute disgrace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take a few minutes of the Senate's time tonight to explain some of the effects on my state of the cost increases arising from the budget, particularly the fuel excise. Of course, Tasmania is an island state and the freight component is particularly significant. Therefore, any increment to the government freight charges has a significant impact on costs and prices in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past few weeks the comment about the budget has really been quite negative. It was a budget that lacked vision, ducked all the hard decisions on spending cuts and tax reform, and it is definitely not about creating too many jobs, or indeed reducing the budget deficit&mdash;despite its misleading title in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own state of Tasmania has been severely affected by this budget in many ways. First, I wish this chamber to take note of the increase in the fuel excise tax, both in petrol and diesel fuel, and the impact of the increase in the wholesale sales tax on Tasmanian industry costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania is an island state with a small market and an economy reliant on exports. At the end of the day, our ultimate success depends very much on the effectiveness and efficiency of our island's and our nation's transport systems. This government has increased the everyday running costs of our transport system by increasing the basic cost of fuel, tyres, spares and rigs, which will all go up as a result of the increase in the sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon my colleague Senator Boswell mentioned that throughout Australia the transport industry will have to cover a 5c per litre diesel excise and a two per cent wholesale sales tax increase. This means that ordinary Tasmanians&mdash;in fact, all Australians&mdash;will have to pay at least an extra $2 to $3 for the average trolley of groceries going through the check-outs each week. Why will this occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Transport Federation has estimated that it will cost an extra five per cent to transport a raw product, such as fruit, vegetables or other grocery-type products, to the manufacturer. Then it will cost a further five per cent to transport the manufactured product from the manufacturer to the wholesaler, and possibly a further five per cent from the wholesaler to the retailer. That is quite a significant increase in terms of the transport component on the everyday items in the grocery basket. It is interesting to note that the government feels that there will be only a 0.5 per cent inflationary effect from this price increase. This may be the effect across the board, but the government seems to have forgotten the effect industry by industry or even state by state&mdash;particularly the effect on the more remote states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania already suffers from lower earnings on average than the rest of Australia. It has the highest unemployment rate, as well as some of the highest grocery prices in Australia. This government is now asking the average Tasmanian family to pay another couple of dollars per week just to put food on the table. Tasmanians will be more adversely affected than perhaps most other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because Tasmania is an island state, it is also an importer of many of the goods it needs. There will be an increase of tens of thousands of dollars for every ship berthing in Tasmania arising from fuel increases alone. The goods carried in these ships will have to bear these costs, and these costs will naturally be passed on to Tasmanian consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanians use around 265 million litres of diesel each year. The immediate grab from the proposed budget is estimated to be $7.7 million this financial year, rising to something like $13.2 million once the increase has fully passed through the system. But it will not stop there because the state tax is based on the retail price which includes the federal tax. The state tax of 6.2 per cent per litre will also increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania is a small, compact island, easy to traverse and covered with fine roads and highways. As my Tasmanian colleague Independent Senator Harradine has noted, we should have the cheapest road and shipping costs in the world. However, this government seems intent on creating a situation where state taxes on fuel are piled upon federal taxes and our hapless exporters then have to recover those taxes from overseas markets. The extra taxation on business inputs should not occur. I remind the Senate that the Fightback GST  proposal took off all of these costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another one of my colleagues from the other House has estimated that the average Tasmanian family of four may have to find an extra $1,360 a year due solely to this budget. So not only are the families and the low income earners the losers in this budget because of the increases in fuel and the wholesale sales tax, but also rural Tasmania will be affected. The increase in fuel, both leaded and unleaded, and diesel will impact on our rural community. On the one hand, the government urges the rural community to become efficient and then, on the other hand, it deliberately increases one of the rural sector's major costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job market in Tasmania, already devastated by this government's induced recession, will be further affected by the budget. The so-called budget to create jobs will cause Tasmanians to lose their jobs. One example that springs to mind is the Savage River iron ore mine. This north-west mine faces closure at an earlier date than originally intended, and with it will go 300 jobs and the $24 million spent in the state annually by the mine and its workers. Savage River mines has stated that the full impact of the fuel excise increase in 12 months will bring forward the planned 1997 closure of its open cut mine to as early as next year. This will cause an underground expansion which may have prolonged the mine for another 10 years to be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Promising and flourishing businesses have also been hit. Tasmania has seen the development of a burgeoning wine industry over the past 10 years. Many small Tasmanian winemakers fear for their viability as many have just commenced and this 55 per cent hike in sales tax could affect their sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the comments by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) today to a journalist about an excise on wine. I suggest that this would be a very dangerous path to tread because, although he might be given an opportunity to raise an excise without legislation for perhaps up to 12 months, within that 12-month period it would be assumed that legislation would be brought down. Given the composition of this house, there is no certainty that that would pass. The consequence would be that the government would have to refund such moneys. So it would be brinkmanship and folly for the Treasurer to pursue the line that he was canvassing with a number of journalists today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it is late, I do not wish to take up any more time of the Senate. The coalition has vowed to oppose key elements of the federal budget in both houses of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to draw this chamber's attention to the fuel tax. Before the election, the coalition promised to lower fuel taxes; but the government has raised them in this budget. Tasmanian senators, for the benefit of Tasmania, will oppose the fuel tax. Senator Harradine, the Independent from Tasmania, has stated publicly that he will oppose the fuel tax. On the other hand, the Tasmanian Democrat, Senator Bell, has been strangely quiet on this issue. So will the Tasmanian family face extra costs in all facets of everyday living because one Tasmanian senator will not oppose the fuel tax? Put simply, the imposition of the fuel tax on Tasmanians will come down to whether or not Senator Bell is concerned about the effect of this budget on Tasmania. I look forward to seeing how he votes on this issue. </PARA>

In the recent ABC docudrama <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor in Power</EMPHASIS> there is a scene which the ABC has chosen to run many times since it was first screened. It shows Senator Richardson saying, `Keating now has more power than Hawke ever dreamed of'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine the magnitude of the power of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). He produces a budget that does not even make it past his own backbench; his own faction disowns it. The ACTU's Martin Ferguson is quoted as saying, only hours after the budget's delivery, `How can you defend the indefensible?'. Even the husband of a new Labor backbencher, himself a powerful Labor and union figure, Michael Easson, is quoted as saying, `It's an act of bastardry'. He originally applied that comment to retrospective full taxation of lump sum and long service leave payments, but he was happy to have the media extend it over the whole of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the rather desperate situation of the few remaining true believers peddling, a little unconvincingly, the `good news' budget story. That is what they were saying back in their electorates. They must have felt like the proverbial pork seller in the synagogue. They came back to Canberra and told their leader what they thought&mdash;and, by all accounts, it was a ripper of a telling. Chapter and verse, the Prime Minister and the cabinet got the message. In the face of this, we have Senator Richardson saying that the leadership and the cabinet have been given a sharp jolt and that he was confident they would consult more as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask honourable senators: will this expanded consultation process include listening to the concerns of the small winegrowers who, with the imposition of an increased sales tax, will be forced out of business? Will this expanded consultation process include listening to the concerns of woolgrowers who have demonstrated unambiguously that they cannot afford any increase in government taxes or levies by leaving the industry? Will this expanded consultation process include listening to the concerns of the leaded petrol users and the diesel users in rural areas who will not only have to pay the additional levy but in most rural towns will be paying up to 20c a litre more than their city counterparts? I suppose the government will consult. It has been told by its ACTU controllers that it must consult. But I wonder whether it will just be consulting more with the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For good measure, we have the ACTU throwing in a few cabinet agenda items. But that will not silence the restless back bench and it will not put them back on the boat. The Prime Minister said that he was alone on the deck before the election. That is one thing that has not changed. Captain Courageous will go down with his ship. I think the budget has changed more times in the last week or so than the members of the cabinet have changed their underpants.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the election, of course, a lot of promises were being made. I was pleased to be there and our leader, Dr Hewson, was there. He had the pleasurable task of telling the delegates what a reduction in fuel excise would mean, not just to them as owner-drivers and operators but also to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been to this particular conference and having talked to the delegates there, I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that they know very well the effect the government's raising of fuel excise will have, not just on their industry but on everybody else in Australia. The difference to the people of Australia between what we were going to do and what the government in fact is doing is something like 26c a litre on leaded fuel. I was most interested to hear Neil O'Keefe MP who was representing the minister, Bob Collins. He tried to defend the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the measures announced in the budget regarding fuel taxes are regressive and will have a huge effect on my state of Tasmania. I noted that at the same conference my Tasmanian colleague Senator Harradine was the guest speaker. He drew attention to the fact that families and low income earners in regional Australia are the losers from this budget. He also went on to say that the disregard for the consequences of the budget's fuel excise measures in Australia as a whole and for regional Australia in particular shows how insulated policy makers are from ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine also pointed out&mdash;this is what I am on about tonight&mdash;that Tasmanians will be more adversely affected than most Australians because everything we get has to be freighted into our state and then it has to be moved around the state, in some instances by rail but mostly by road. Tasmanians use something like 265 million litres of diesel fuel a year and the immediate grab from the proposed budget will be $7.7 million in this financial year. That will rise to something like $13.2 million once the increases flow through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will not stop there because the state tax is based on the retail price, which includes the federal tax. The state tax of 6.2c per litre will also increase. Tasmanians who still use oil to heat their homes will notice that the heating oil tax increase is nearly 80 per cent, from 5.5c a litre to 8.5c a litre. This adjusted figure that the government is imposing on all Australians will mean that ordinary Australians will have to pay at least an extra $2 to $3 for an average trolley of consumables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know&mdash;you would know particularly, Mr Acting Deputy President, representing the National Party which represents a lot of people out in the bush&mdash;everything that moves around this country and that we use has a freight component. What better way to increase the cost of goods than to increase freight cost by increasing the fuel cost?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was Senator Harradine showing concern about this matter; our state Premier, Mr Ray Groom, was also. He made the point that our island state was a small market and an economy reliant on exports. At the end of the day, our ultimate success depends very much on the effectiveness and efficiency of this nation's transport system. He said that Tasmanians will be looking to the Senate to protect their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Senator Harradine has nailed his colours to the flag and made his points well known. Like my colleague Senator Watson, I call upon Senator Bell to do the same thing. Senator Bell, since being elected, has repeatedly urged Tasmanians to reject party politics in favour of a free thinking, democratic viewpoint. I believe that this is a very good time for him to show the electors of Tasmania just how well his free thinking, democrat viewpoint in fact works. Senator Bell knows that by joining the coalition and the Independents he can ensure that the most regressive budget in this country's history can be overturned. He knows that Tasmanians will be paying more for everything from cleaning aids to ice cream. The fact is that the increase in petrol taxes hits Tasmania more than any other state. I would call upon Senator Bell to reconsider his position on this matter and vote with the coalition to get rid of this impost that is going to affect not just Tasmania but all of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add my voice to others that have been raised in opposition to the government's proposed increase in tax on wine in this country. Much has been said in relation to this debate, but nothing has yet been put to this chamber in relation to the Western Australian point of view. I will take just a few brief moments to bring to the Senate's attention the plight of winemakers in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry in Western Australia is a fledgling industry. In some areas it has been in existence only in the last 10 years. An increase in tax of this sort will be sorely felt by such an industry. That industry is worth some $60 million to Western Australia, and some 15 to 20 per cent of the produce there is exported. That leaves some 80 to 85 per cent subject to domestic consumption and subject to the increase in tax on wine. It therefore makes it very much a victim of this proposal by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently met with some winemakers in Western Australia and I can tell honourable senators that they are struggling to make ends meet. They have small vineyards which employ on average some half dozen people, and 80 per cent of them are young people who face the prospect of losing their employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, the wine industry in Western Australia contributes greatly to tourism and cottage industries in the areas where those vineyards are situated. Should there be any winding back of the wine industry in Western Australia, those areas also will sorely feel the effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government to consider this because, although Western Australia is a small state in population, it is a great state with respect to the percentage contribution it makes to this country by way of national export and gross national product. The wine industry in Western Australia could really be a great industry for the future and could contribute greatly to exports to come. Yet we have small winegrowers who have to pay a levy of $6.10 per tonne of grape they harvest; that is merely for the privilege of growing the grape&mdash;and that levy applies to small vignerons who produce less than 5,000 tonnes a year. Those are the people who should not be hit; they are the ones who are the contributors of the future; they are the ones who are still waiting to get a full return on their vines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just remind the Senate that it takes some 15 years for a winegrower to break even. In fact, it takes at least five years to get a vintage from the average vine. We cannot compare the wine industry with the beer or spirits industries. Winegrowers rely on one harvest a year. Such things as a bad season and other market factors can affect them greatly. Brewers can brew beer all the year through, and distillers can distil spirits any day of the year. But the winegrower has only that one harvest a year. He also does not have the economies of scale of the brewer and the distiller. I think it is completely erroneous to compare those industries to the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all those reasons, I oppose the increase in the tax on wine. I implore the government to reconsider this increase and bear in mind the situation as it affects my state&mdash;the state of Western Australia. </PARA>

I am very pleased that the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, is still here because I am hoping that what I have to say will be music to his ears, in a manner of speaking.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand that. I have had a lifelong love of music having been involved in choirs for some 30 years, particularly in stage musical productions. I guess my thoughts wandered as to what the possibility would be of a choir formed by the trade union movement actually singing in harmony. Perhaps it might give some indication that the trade union movement will be singing a new tune in the future. But, on reflection, perhaps I could offer some suggestions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that the choir look to some favourites of the past for inspiration. I think immediately of the line from that old coal mining classic: `Sixteen tonnes and what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt'. This is exactly what is happening to the Australian economy under this government's regressive, uncaring and, in some ways, anti-business policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been in this place for some 12 months and having looked across the other side at the Labor Party's front bench, I thought that, if it were looking for a signature tune that this choir might perform for it on some special occasions, that old favourite, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">He ain't heavy, he's my brother</EMPHASIS>, might be one which would suit it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reflected on the negotiations that have been taking place between Bill Kelty from the trade union movement and Mr Brereton, the Minister for Industrial Relations, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I do not know whether or not Bill Kelty can sing. But I bet that if he could, he would immediately have thought of the old Guys and Dolls favourite, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sit down, you're rocking the boat</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have heard mention made of the Prime Minister and his involvement in his piggery and whether or not things are turning out as well as they might. I remember, certainly with some affection, the old musical, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fiddler on the Roof</EMPHASIS>, in which at one time I was fortunate enough to play a part. In that musical, the song I had to sing was, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">If I were a rich man</EMPHASIS>. I think that probably it would be very appropriate if the choir could perform that occasionally at official functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not want to delay the Senate any longer but, as I said earlier, I have a tremendous interest in choral singing and I certainly hope that this new trade union choir can add some much needed harmony to the labour movement. I for one certainly would wish it very well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The overpayments were caused by a one-off programming error with the migration of data during the changeover to Comcare Australia's new workers' compensation computer system `PRACSYS' from Comcare Australia's previous workers' compensation system `COMPENSE'.</PARA>
