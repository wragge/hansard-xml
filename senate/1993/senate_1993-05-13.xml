<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Coalition, in Government, will remove Federal legislation and policies that preclude any particular type of generation from being considered and assessed in a fair and balanced way with all other generation methods. The Federal Government would not, therefore, oppose the development of the nuclear fuel cycle in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party's policy is very clear. The ALP's Platform, Resolutions and Rules approved by the 39th National Conference in 1991 prohibit the establishment in Australia of nuclear power plants and all other stages of the nuclear fuel cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 January the Environment Minister, Ros Kelly, put out a press release entitled "Fallout Fischer should rule out nuclear power stations or admit plans. In it she challenged the Coalition to&mdash;and I quote&mdash;"categorically rule out domestic nuclear power stations if the Coalition wins Government at the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Kelly went on to say: "If the Coalition . . . refuse (sic) to categorically rule out power stations then we can only assume that they have something to hide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Kelly also challenged the Opposition spokesman on resources and energy, National Party leader Mr Tim Fischer, and the leader of the Opposition Dr John Hewson to reveal the extent of any discussions they had had with companies interested in building nuclear power plants in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mrs Kelly again challenged the Opposition, on 11 February, to rule out the construction of nuclear power plants in Australia. The following day she drew comparisons between Labor and the Opposition and referred to the "huge differences" between the parties on, amongst other things, uranium mining, uranium enrichment and the construction of nuclear power stations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 13 February the then Resources Minister, Alan Griffiths, stepped up the pressure by revealing that Mr Fischer was on record as saying that it would be "nice" to have a uranium enrichment plant operating on the Spencer Gulf in South Australia. Mr Griffiths was referring to a report in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 13 August 1991 which stated that Mr Fischer could see Australia, under a Hewson Government, building uranium enrichment plants in South Australia and the Northern Territory. Mr Fischer was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition is committed to go the path of uranium enrichment. It could be the obvious extension that could save the South Australian economy from complete collapse and would be a nice complement to the massive and magnificent Roxby Downs mine to have, for example, a uranium enrichment plant operating on the Spencer Gulf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 26 May 1992 Dr Hewson stated in parliament that he was on record as being committed to going down the path of uranium enrichment too. Mr Griffiths released the appropriate quotation from Hansard with his 13 February press release.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Griffiths also challenged Mr Fischer to tell the people of Australia where the Coalition proposed to establish uranium enrichment plants and whether these would be subject to Dr Hewson's 12 month limit on environmental assessment. The carefully worded press release did not include any opposition to nuclear power production or uranium enrichment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three days later Mr Griffiths put out another press release after Mr Fischer had admitted to meeting with proponents of the development of a uranium enrichment industry in Australia. Mr Griffiths challenged Mr Fischer to reveal where uranium enrichment plants would be located under a Coalition Government. He stated that Labor Party platform prohibits the establishment in Australia of nuclear power plants and all other stages of the nuclear fuel cycle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the same day&mdash;16 February&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> carried a front page article entitled Coming soon: uranium enrichment. The article revealed that Mr Fischer had once met one of the participants in a joint venture called Nuclear Industries Consortium of Australia which was considering a firm proposal for the development of a uranium enrichment industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On that day Mrs Kelly again issued a press release. In it she referred to the Coalition's policies to support nuclear power plants, uranium enrichment plants and mining in National Parks as "scorched earth policy".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following day Mr Griffiths accused Mr Fischer of hiding commitments he, Mr Fischer, had given to the industry proponent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While all this was going on, the major environment groups came out on 19 February calling for a non-nuclear future. The groups criticised both major parties for supporting uranium mining and export, but saved their strongest criticism for the Coalition. Their press release stated that&mdash;and I quote&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's commitment to the nuclear industry seems to be based upon ideology rather than economic reality and is intended to drag us further down the nuclear path longterm. There is simply no logic in their call for expanded uranium mining in Kakadu and elsewhere or for enrichment plants in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 21 February the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean, issued a press release defending Labor's stand on uranium mining. This was due to revelations a few days earlier in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article that the Government had accepted for consideration two applications to mine uranium at Jabiluka and Koongarra. The applications were from Energy Resources of Australia and Koongarra Mines and were made under the Government's new 10 per cent development allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Crean affirmed the Government's three mines policy and contrasted what he called the Government's "consistent policy approach" with the Opposition's support for an expansion of uranium mining, fuel enrichment and the establishment of a nuclear waste industry in Australia. He again challenged Mr Fischer to "come clean" on plans to locate enrichment and waste facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing is clear from this war of words. The Government wanted to distance itself from the Coalition's policy of support for uranium enrichment and nuclear power production. It wanted to highlight Labor policy of opposition to uranium enrichment and all other stages of the nuclear fuel cycle. There were other motivations operating at a more covert level. The Government wanted to deflect attention from its own moves towards greater protection or the nuclear industry&mdash;as witnessed by last year's ANSTO Amendment Act. It wanted to shore up the green vote in what was seen as a very tight election. But I won't dwell on these reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I simply wish to point to the Government's clear, unambiguous and upfront opposition to uranium enrichment and nuclear power production during the election. This is to be greatly welcomed. Certainly, that unambiguous support was missing back in 1985 when my predecessor, Don Chipp, tabled a private bill to prohibit the importation of nuclear hardware. The purpose of the bill was to prevent the establishment of nuclear power plants, uranium enrichment plants and nuclear waste reprocessing facilities in Australia. It provided exceptions for medical and industrial uses of radioisotopes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Former Senator Chipp stressed in his second reading speech that solar and wind power were the energy sources of the future. On this subject, I was certainly greatly heartened by an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 22 December 1992 which reported Mr Simon Crean as saying that the development of photovoltaic cells powered by solar energy "is where the future lies".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the Government rejected the bill, even though as Don Chipp pointed out, many Government members knew in their heart of hearts that there was nothing wrong with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I repeat Mrs Kelly's call for the Coalition to categorically rule out domestic nuclear power stations, and ask her to apply her demand of the Coalition to the Government's own agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask her to categorically rule out nuclear power stations by implementing Labor policy via legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Mrs Kelly said of the Coalition, if they "refuse to categorically rule out power stations then we can only assume that they have something to hide". By not supporting this present bill, the Government would be keeping its options open for a nuclear future, contrary to what was said during the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is based on the Victorian legislation entitled Nuclear Activities (Prohibitions) Act 1983. That Act prohibited the entire range of activities involved in the nuclear fuel cycle&mdash;from uranium mining, milling, enrichment and power production to reprocessing and waste disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill before you focuses only on three elements of the nuclear fuel cycle&mdash;two of which I have discussed. The third&mdash;that is, reprocessing&mdash;was not an election issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, reprocessing was included in this bill on two accounts. Firstly, concern over the activities of ANSTO in regard to its research program into Synroc. Synroc was designed to incorporate liquid high level wastes after spent fuel has been reprocessed. Australia does not possess any liquid high level waste, nor should we be supporting the nuclear reprocessing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANSTO spends $2.6 million a year on Synroc research&mdash;$2.6 million of public money that ANSTO hopes may, one day, be used by the reprocessing industry in other countries. This compares to $2 million being spent on solar energy research. Solar energy is a proven technology with enormous potential for providing energy needs for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reprocessing, contrary to what one might at first think, is not another word for recycling. Reprocessing does allow the extraction of uranium from spent nuclear fuel which can then be reused, but it also produces high level waste and plutonium. Plutonium is used in the production of nuclear weapons. In Japan, the Government plans to use plutonium in fast breeder reactors, a high risk and unproven form of technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that there is no commercial market for Synroc. This became apparent in the public hearings held by the Research Reactor Review committee. From evidence given by industry representatives on the Synroc Study Group, it became obvious that the research was being policy driven rather than market driven.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why is Australia pursuing such a policy? If there is no market in it, if it does not increase our national security, why are we doing it? And why is a Labor Government, committed in its party policy to the prohibition of all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, supporting such a policy? Finally, why has there been no public debate over the use of public money for such a dubious research activity?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats believe that funding to Synroc research should cease and the money should be reallocated to the Energy Research and Development Corporation for research into renewable energies and energy efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second reason for including reprocessing in this bill is that a reprocessing industry should not be allowed in Australia for moral, environmental and health reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reprocessing violates the principle of intergenerational equity and the precautionary principle by generating waste that remains toxic for many thousands of years to come. Future generations will have to bear the enormous costs created by today's generation. This is morally reprehensible when there are clean and sustainable energy options either available or near commercialisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting that the British have spent $7 billion over 18 years on the construction of a reprocessing plant at Sellafield, known as THORP. However, the plant is not open yet and there are now grave doubts over whether it will ever open. Increasingly, the authorities are realising that the economic costs and the environmental impact of the plant overwhelmingly outweigh any potential benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is still no environmentally safe method of disposal of radioactive waste, even after nearly 40 years of nuclear power production. Much effort has been invested in trying to solve this intractable problem. Here, I am reminded of a comment made by Hannef Alfven in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (May 1972):</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a problem is too difficult to solve, one cannot claim that it is solved by pointing to all the efforts made to solve it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And while reprocessing plants exist, there will be major questions over occupational health and safety on site, due mainly because management and unions have their own reasons for playing down levels of risk and danger in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators, this bill gives the Government an opportunity to enshrine in legislation the sentiments expressed during the election, in line with Labor party policy. I urge the Government to support this bill which will increase Australia's standing abroad in a world becoming increasingly disillusioned with nuclear power.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TELECOMMUNICATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to extend to the three public mobile carriers the benefit of land access powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general carriers, Telstra Corporation Limited (formerly AOTC) and Optus Networks Pty Limited (a subsidiary of Optus Communications Pty Limited) have certain powers under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to enter privately owned land in order to inspect, evaluate and to install or construct telecommunications facilities for the provision of general telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently does not provide for mobile telecommunications carriers to have the same statutory land access rights in relation to inspection, evaluation, installation or construction of telecommunications facilities for the provision of mobile services. The companies which hold licences as mobile carriers are Telstra Corporation Limited, Optus Mobile Pty Limited and Vodafone Pty Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision of competition has been a central focus of the Government's telecommunications reforms. Lack of statutory rights to enter land could adversely affect the ability of the public mobile carriers to provide viable competition in relation to mobile telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has therefore decided to extend to the three public mobile carriers powers to enter land and do things necessary to land for purposes connected with the supply of mobile telecommunications services. The carriers are to exercise these powers as authorised by and consistent with their licence conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to extending land access powers to the mobile carriers, the amendments also impose the same obligations on the mobile carriers that currently apply to the general  carriers. These obligations require the giving of reasonable written notice to the owner of land, and in certain cases, to the owner and occupier of land, that the carrier is intending to exercise its powers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also include new provisions for a Land Access Code to regulate the use of the powers to enter land in relation to both general and mobile carriers. The Land Access Code is also intended to safeguard the interests of property owners. New provisions are also included in the amendments to make the Code binding on the carriers, to provide AUSTEL, the Australian Telecommunications Authority, with the power to issue written directions to carriers about how they are to comply with the Code and to ensure that such directions are enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in this Bill are not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Saturday, 13 March 1993, the Australian people clearly indicated that they shared the Government's belief that this nation must advance together. By advancing together, not only will we build a strong economy, but a fairer society that pays particular attention to the special needs of groups such as the aged and the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cornerstone of the Government's retirement incomes policy is, and remains, an adequate age pension for those most in need. But that doesn't mean that we can't do more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Government recently extended full Commonwealth fringe benefits to all pensioners and older long-term allowees and agreed to compensate the States in 1992-93 for the cost of extending verified State concessions to this group. We have also introduced the Superannuation Guarantee Charge to improve access to higher private income in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, as part of its commitment to a fairer Australia, the Government announced in `Building On Strength' that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test. The Government recognised that although some retirees have suffered from a reduction in their nominal income due to recent falls in interest rates that would entitle them, under the income test, to either a pension or a higher rate of pension, they would still not receive this because of their relatively high level of assets and the effect of the pension assets withdrawal rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Amendment Bill 1993 gives effect to this initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 20 September 1993, the pensions assets test set out in the Social Security Act 1991 will be adjusted so that if a person has assets in excess of the assets test threshold applicable to them, the person's pension will be reduced by $19.50 rather than $26 for every $250 above the threshold. This means that many retirees will either get more pension or qualify for a pension for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, a single person currently receiving age pension who has assets of $230,000, no source of income apart from the pension and lives in rented accommodation will receive an additional $37.00 per fortnight. A retired married couple with assets of $300,000 apart from their principal residence will each now receive an age pension of $52.90 per fortnight provided that they satisfy the qualification rules and their combined income is less than $922 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In `Building On Strength' the Government reaffirmed that its overriding priority for the next three years is jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In `Investing In The Nation' the Government noted that many people seeking full time work are currently holding part time jobs that continued to grow during the recession. An increasing proportion of job search allowance and newstart allowance recipients are reporting income from casual and part-time work. The Government indicated its support for this trend given that as well as providing an additional source of income, such employment assists job seekers to maintain their skills and their informal network of contacts that can be so important in finding a full time job. To further encourage the trend the Government announced a range of measures that would both improve the financial return from undertaking part-time or casual employment and reduce client uncertainty about the effects of such employment on future entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill introduces two of those measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act will be amended from 20 September 1993 so as to introduce an additional free area for earned income of $30 per fortnight for single recipients of job search allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance and to increase the free earned income area applicable to a partnered allowance from $30 to $50 per fortnight for earned income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act will also be amended from that date to replace a number of differing provisions for exemption from the ordinary waiting period for these allowances with one simple provision. Under the new arrangements, claimants of job search allowance, newstart allowance or sickness allowance will not have to serve an ordinary one week waiting period if they have been in receipt of income support within the previous 13 weeks. This provision will be much simpler for clients to understand and for departmental staff to administer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of common terms used in social security and migration laws. As a result of recent amendments to the Migration Regulations from 1 February 1993, there is a need to make a number of minor technical amendments to the Social Security Act so as to ensure ongoing consistency in terminology. This Bill effects those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill proposes amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act to implement the Government's election promise to reduce the assets test withdrawal rate from $104 to $78 per annum for each $1000 of assets above the assets test threshold. This change, which takes effect from 20 September 1993, provides for greater equity in the assessment of pensions under the assets test. The Government's promise to make this change is a positive response to the adverse impact falling interest rates have on pensioners in some circumstances and it has been  welcomed by pensioner groups and non-pensioner retirees as a positive and well targeted measure. It will particularly benefit retirees in rural and remote areas who own farming properties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also proposes three changes as a result of Government decisions to commit Australian Defence Force personnel to serve with United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in a number of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these relates to Cambodia. The Veterans' Entitlements Act was amended in 1992 to designate Cambodia as an operational area. This allowed for the extension of benefits under the Act to members of the Australian Defence Force serving with United Nations Forces as part of the peacekeeping efforts in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice has recently been received by the Government from the Chief of the Defence Force that some members of the Australian Defence Force have been engaged in United Nations operations across the Cambodian border in Laos and Thailand. Accordingly, the Government has decided to amend Schedule 2 to the Act to extend the operational area of Cambodia to include areas in Laos and Thailand that are not more than fifty kilometres from the border with Cambodia. This amendment takes effect from 20 October 1991, the same date that Cambodia was declared an operational area. It will ensure that any Australian Defence Force personnel who cross the Cambodian border into either Laos or Thailand, will continue to be covered for benefits under the Act in respect of that service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second change arises from the Government's decision to extend benefits under the Act to members of the small Australian Defence Force contingent serving with United Nations Peacekeeping Forces in the former Yugoslavia. In view of the significant additional risks associated with such service, the Bill proposes that the area comprising the former Yugoslavia be designated as an `operational area'. This change will take effect on and from 12 January 1992, that being the first date on which Australian Defence Force personnel commenced serving in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third change is an amendment to give effect to the Government's decision, announced in December last year, to provide benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act to members of the Australian Defence Force serving with the United Nations in Somalia as part of Australia's contribution to operation RESTORE HOPE and the United Nations Operation Somalia. This amendment will take effect from 20 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of declaring both the former Yugoslavia and  Somalia as operational areas is that it will allow for any claims for disability pension, due to injury or death in respect of such service, to be determined on the more generous standard of proof provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Service in each of these areas is also to be regarded as `qualifying service'. This will allow access to service pension provided the other conditions relating to age, income and assets are also met. The Bill proposes the necessary amendments to give effect to this decision. It also contains some minor consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Public Service Act to ensure that they recognise the newly proposed operational areas for the purposes of the benefits available under those Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complex legislative and administrative problems arise on each occasion Australia is asked to contribute to international peacekeeping obligations. It is in no small measure due to the linking of the portfolio responsibilities of Veterans' Affairs and Defence Science and Personnel, that each of these legislative changes can be implemented so soon after the Government has announced its commitment, or in the case of Cambodia, after the Government considered the need for change in the light of new circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PROTECTION OF THE SEA (OIL POLLUTION COMPENSATION FUND) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to introduce this Bill to the Senate as part of a package of four Bills concerning compensation for damage caused by oil spills from tankers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the Bills is to give effect to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971. The Convention is widely referred to as the Fund Convention. The Bill will also enable Australia to give effect in due course to Protocols amending the Fund Convention adopted in 1976 and 1992, although neither of these has yet entered into force internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The international regime providing compensation for damages caused by oil spills from tankers is governed by the Fund Convention and another Convention, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969, known as the Civil Liability Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both conventions were drawn up under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations. Australia has been a party to the Civil Liability Convention since 1984, and its requirements are implemented by the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Liability Convention deals with the liability of shipowners for pollution damage and currently guarantees that some $A266 per ton of the ships tonnage up to a maximum of $A28m is available to Australian interests in the event of oil pollution damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fund Convention is supplementary to the Civil Liability Convention and establishes a regime for compensating victims when the compensation under the Civil Liability Convention is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is achieved by applying an annual levy to any oil company which receives after carriage by ship more than 150,000 tonnes of contributing oil in a calendar year. "Contributing oil" for the purposes of the Convention includes mainly crude oil and heavy fuel oil. Non-persistent oils such as gasoline, light diesel oil and kerosene do not fall within the scope of the Convention. Thus the burden of providing compensation for oil pollution damage is shared between the ship and cargo owners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acceptance of the Fund Convention will immediately increase the amount of compensation for oil pollution damage available to Australian interests to some $A120m. This will increase to $A400.8m when the 1992 Protocol amending the Convention enters into force and certain other conditions are met. It is not possible to predict when the 1992 Protocol will enter into force, as it is entirely dependent on how quickly the required level of international acceptance is forthcoming. I would be surprised, however, if it were not either in force or substantially close to it within five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's rights and obligations under the Convention will only be applied to oil pollution incidents which occur after Australian acceptance of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acceptance of the Fund Convention will also mean that Australian shipowners will be indemnified for a part of the total amount of their liability under the Civil Liability Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fund Convention represents the legal inter-governmental version of a voluntary scheme set up by the major international oil companies in 1971. The scheme is called the Contract regarding Interim Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution, abbreviated to CRISTAL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This scheme still exists but was only developed as a temporary measure until the Fund Convention achieved a sufficiently high level of acceptance internationally. CRISTAL is due to cease operation in February 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fund Convention has established a worldwide inter-governmental organisation, the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, known as the IOPC Fund, to administer the compensation regime. Reports on quantities of oil received in a calendar year are forwarded by Governments to the IOPC Fund, with the contributions being paid by the individual companies directly to the IOPC Fund. There are currently 51 member countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two types of contributions to the IOPC Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An initial contribution is payable by receivers of oil when a country becomes a member of the IOPC Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annual contributions are levied to meet the anticipated payments of compensation, indemnification and administrative expenses during the subsequent year. Annual contributions therefore vary widely, and since the Fund Convention entered into force internationally in 1978 the total amount required from contributors in all member countries has varied from zero to $A60m. The IOPC Fund paid out over $A20m in claims during 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on 1992 figures for the transportation of oil into  and around Australia, the nine Australian companies which receive more than 150,000 tonnes of contributing oil per year would be required to contribute to the IOPC Fund a combined total of some $A138,000 as an initial contribution and $A568,000 in the following year as an annual contribution. It can be seen that the outlay is relatively small in comparison to the compensation available, and these contributions would replace existing CRISTAL contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Convention entered into force internationally in 1978, until recently successive Australian Governments were opposed to Australian acceptance of the Convention on the grounds that the risk of major oil pollution damage occurring in Australia was low, and that consequently Australia would be subsidising countries of higher risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first significant change to the basis for this position occurred during the late 1980's when an amendment to the industry-based CRISTAL scheme introduced a reimbursement system for oil companies contributing to the Fund. As all major Australian oil companies currently contribute to the voluntary scheme, the net cost to Australian industry will be minimal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other major development followed the grounding of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> in Alaska in March 1989, when the Australian oil industry carried out an assessment of Australia's ability to deal with large spills from oil tankers. One of the outcomes is industry support for Australian acceptance of the Fund Convention. The order of clean up costs which emerged from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> spill indicates that existing compensation under the Civil Liability Convention would be totally inadequate to cover a very large spill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pollution incident involving the tanker <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coast in 1991 clearly demonstrated that Australia cannot be considered immune from large tanker spills. Had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> been a total loss, damage claims could easily have exceeded existing compensation limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IOPC Fund has established a global reputation for its quick settlement of claims and since 1978 has been involved in the settlement of claims arising out of 60 incidents. The IOPC Fund pays compensation for expenses incurred for clean up operations, preventative measures, damage to property and economic loss. I believe this concept of economic loss to be particularly significant, as compensation can now be provided for loss of earnings suffered by fishermen or by hoteliers and restaurateurs at seaside resorts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me now turn to the supporting Bills. The Protection of the Sea (Imposition of Contributions to Oil Pollution Compensation Fund&mdash;Customs) Bill imposes contributions where oil is imported into Australia from a place outside Australia. The Protection of the Sea (Imposition of Contributions to Oil Pollution Compensation Fund&mdash;Excise)  Bill imposes contributions where oil is moved by sea from one place in Australia to another place in Australia. The Protection of the Sea (Imposition of Contributions to Oil Pollution Compensation Fund&mdash;General) Bill imposes contributions where the contributions appear to be duties of customs or duties of excise but a Court rules that they are neither.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill essentially establishes the procedure by which companies will be required to provide details of oil receipts to the IOPC Fund through the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The Bill also imposes an obligation on oil receivers to pay contributions and gives effect to the various operative provisions of the Fund Convention. Penalties are provided for companies that fail to provide details of the amount of oil received or provide false information or returns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already mentioned that the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill will enable Australia to adopt the two Protocols to the Fund Convention adopted by the International Maritime Organization in 1976 and 1992. Neither of these instruments is yet in force. The 1976 Protocol is administrative in nature, as it deals only with the units of account used by the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 Protocol, however, represents a significant step in providing compensation for oil pollution damage. As well as significantly providing for an increase in the amount of compensation available to over $A400m, the Protocol will widen the scope of the Convention to cover damage within the Exclusive Economic Zone, spills from unladen tankers and the cost of preventative measures taken when no oil spill occurs. The Bill contains provisions which will be proclaimed to commence when this Protocol enters into force internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adoption of the Convention and Protocols and the passage of the Bills currently before the House will place Australia in the international forefront of providing compensation for damages caused by oil pollution from tankers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in the Bills will not have any effect on Commonwealth revenue and they will have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the two broadcasting services Bills are being taken separately and I therefore address my remarks to the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1993. This Bill amends part 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, being the provisions that deal with pay television, and seeks to ensure that MDS-delivered pay television cannot begin in Australia until the Government's preferred method of delivery&mdash;satellite technology&mdash;is up and running. It gives legislative backing to the Government's intent in this area now that the legality of a ministerial determination to the Australian Broadcasting Authority issued by the Minister and designed to achieve this has been challenged in the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has had a long and tortuous history. One can go back to 1980, when the then Fraser Government gave what it thought was the green light to pay television in Australia. Here we are in 1993 and, on one view, we are still as far away as ever from achieving that objective. The Broadcasting Services Bill went through the Parliament in the middle of last year and the part relating to pay television went through the Parliament in December last year. The Government now maintains that it was never intended that MDS technology should be other than a niche service; indeed, that it should only ever have been regarded as ancillary and certainly was never contemplated as being a commercially viable primary delivery system. There is nothing in the legislation that would give expression to that alleged intent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does the legislation make it very clear that MDS was one of a range of technologies that ought to have been available to those wanting to get into the industry, consistent with a technology-neutral approach, but in some respects it can be argued that the Act contemplated that MDS&mdash;microwave&mdash;would come on stream first. There was a specific requirement placed in the Act to ensure that any rental arrangements could be cancelled at short notice to enable people to migrate from microwave to satellite in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that, with Telecom's ADSL technology, other forms of fibre-optic cable and twisted copper paired developments, there is likely to be a wide range of technologies which will be integrated over time and what we will see in this country is hybrid technology, drawing on the latest available technical developments. That being the case, it is very difficult to argue that somehow the Parliament's view of the matter was that there ought to be implied limitations on the use to which MDS technology is to be put. Certainly, the view the coalition has consistently espoused is that the legislative framework should be technology neutral; in other words, that the Government should not be out there trying to second-guess the market or to decide which form of technology it prefers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History shows that not only has that been a very dangerous way to go but in many respects it has been an extraordinarily expensive way to go as far as the consumer is concerned. One has only to look at the D-MAC fiasco in the United Kingdom a few years ago, where different technologies were being used, with BSB being required to use D-MAC and ultimately Sky starting up on PAL analogue and finally creaming the market to the point where there was a merger of the two companies, but not before something like #1.2 billion had been thrown away on that very destructive form of competition. So I think the lesson ought to have been well and truly learned that not only are there very significant dangers of getting it wrong but also that the consumer can come off very much second best if one tries to force any particular technology to be the preferred delivery mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the general view of all parties now would be that it is not desirable to somehow try to insist on one technology rather than another. The ideal starting point would be to try to ensure that all parties are able to start up at the same time and are able to choose their own poisons. If that is to be the approach, we will have technology neutrality and we will have commercial choices being made. We then let the system evolve in the most commercially viable&mdash;and presumably technically effective&mdash;manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that legislation having been in place for many months, and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Collins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) having made it clear that they saw a bright future for MDS&mdash;they were quite disparaging of some of the limitations of satellite technology&mdash;it seems odd to us that they should turn around at the very last minute and seek to abort the whole MDS licence process by giving directions to the ABA not to issue licences and by simply trying to close down a process which had already been embarked upon. In those circumstances, we certainly take the view that, given that there is litigation pending and that a decision has been reserved in the Federal Court, it is quite wrong for the Government to be trying to render that whole litigation pointless, in effect, by saying that MDS technology cannot commence until satellite technology is up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very uncertain from the legislation when that might be. One view is that it requires an agreement between the two satellite licence holders and, in terms of a common digital standard, there are, I think, a number of views about when that will be and what the appropriate standard will be. It is certainly worth exploring that further to consider whether there is not a start-up date that would suit all of the parties in this area. But for the Government to be simply out there saying that the licences&mdash;which had been granted, which were not restricted to narrowcast, and which clearly contemplated broadcast services in the area of pay television&mdash;should now be put on hold and frozen until such time as an uncertain start-up date for satellite pay television services is finally agreed upon, seems to us to be frustrating the clear intention of the Parliament. In those circumstances, we would be opposed to these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are different views that can be taken about the efficiency of microwave technology. Given that most forms of technology have technical limitations, and that is why there is more than one form of technology, it is nonetheless the position that MDS has always had significant potential&mdash;perhaps as part of a hybrid system but on one view as a primary system. That was certainly not ruled out by the form of the legislation. In those circumstances, the statements by the Minister and by the Prime Minister in recent days and recent months have been absolutely extraordinary, particularly given that the Prime Minister's view in the middle of last year was that MDS was a very good technology and one that he looked forward to. Senator Collins was welcoming MDS as the technology that would commence pay television in Australia. However, by November they had formed a view that it was an inferior technology. Senator Collins called it a lousy technology; I think he even used the expression `garbage technology'. They made it very clear that at that time they took the view that it was commercially irrelevant and that it had very limited application in the field of pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of months later, finding these amendments being put forward, or these actions being taken, to frustrate the broadcasting authority's ability to issue licences, presumably on the basis that they had reached the position that MDS had fundamentally different technical properties, I am not aware of any advice to that effect to the Minister. Certainly, we would very much welcome it if he does produce that advice in due course. Once again, we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister only a couple of days ago telling the House of Representatives that in his view MDS was still a very inferior technology, and he quoted at length from that November briefing paper which formed the basis for a Cabinet submission that was disparaging of MDS. So there have been, over a period of some nine months, or perhaps less than 12 months, four different positions taken by the Government in terms of the efficacy and efficiency of MDS as a delivery system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to read the transcript of the proceedings in the Federal Court, as I have done, courtesy of the Minister, to find that he was really tested to the ultimate in terms of verbal gymnastics. That is because he was basically trying to defend the indefensible, to argue that somehow what he was able to do was to frustrate the clear will of the Parliament because he believed&mdash;and others, including David Hill, believed&mdash;that the Government had got it wrong. That is not a principle of law that is recognised in the courts and I will be very interested to see what Mr Justice Whitlam has to say in due course. All I can say is that it will be a very novel proposition, and Senator Collins can look forward to law report immortality if that eventuates, because we will then have reached a position where all the principles of statutory interpretation have been stood on their heads, and one can ignore the clear words of an Act by arguing that that really was not what someone had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point in all matters of statutory interpretation is that the Act speaks for itself; effect is given to the plain meaning. It is only if there are confusions and contradictions between expressions that the courts are then called upon to effectively choose between competing views. I do not think anyone argues and, indeed, the Minister did not even argue, that on their face these words give plain effect to the Government's and the Parliament's intention that MDS be available, without strings, for both narrowcast and broadcast purposes. If that is the situation, there is really no point in the Minister or anyone else coming along and arguing that they know better than the Parliament and that this ought to be interpreted from a fundamentally different point of view. We do have those concerns, that this twisting and turning that the Government has gone through is really not only in the face of the express provisions of the Act, but also is contrary to legal advice which it has obtained and is not based on any more up-to-date written advice&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"this bill be referred to a select committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in August 1993 and that provisions relating to the composition and powers of the committee be contained in a subsequent resolution.".</PARA>
<PARA>That would give an opportunity for all parties to put forward considered submissions as to the appropriate start-up date for MDS licences and the satellite licence process. We do not intend that the current process in relation to satellite licences ought to be cut short; indeed, as we will demonstrate when we come to the next debate, we very much disagree with the Government trying to change the rules in midstream. However, we do think it is a much safer approach to invite all interested parties to present submissions based on the most up-to-date technical information, rather than Senator Bourne, the Minister and I all having to juggle in our minds what somehow we ultimately judge to be the most effective start-up date. </PARA>

I therefore submit to all parties that it makes a great deal of sense to be able to have these matters considered over a period of time that does not put enormous pressures on the parties. That does ensure that we approach the process in a sensible manner and it does allow all of those who have knowledge and interest in the matters to argue their cases. I think we owe it to the consumers to get it right and to make sure that the judgments we take are ones based on proper and formal arguments and submissions and not simply done on the basis of compromises and discussions that politicians think, even in good faith, will get it right.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Senate that, if the Government and the Democrats want this process to bring about a viable result that will favour consumers, the best way of doing that is to allow for the matter to be considered properly on the basis of informed submissions. If that is the case, we will not have any more of this nonsense of Ministers trying to override the will of the Parliament and having to be taken to court&mdash;as Mr Stokes did&mdash;to demonstrate that the Minister did not have a leg to stand on. In the case of Mr Cosser, we will not presume to pass judgment on the outcome of those proceedings; we simply say that there is not much support out there for what the Government sought to do in this instance and the sooner we get back to rational decision making the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are looking at the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill that would restrict MDS pay TV, and we have to look at what we really want to achieve in this whole debate. We have to look at where we have been in the past and where we want to go in the future. So, what do we want? First and foremost, we must all want to achieve the best possible pay TV service for Australians. That has been our goal all along. If it has been the rest of the Parliament's goal all along, we have gone about it in a very shoddy way. We have to have a national service which is technology neutral, gives the maximum boost to local programming and local manufacturers, gives a fair go to all players, creates export opportunities, and helps to restore our reputation as a place to invest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be proposing amendments in the committee stage of the Bill. We do not want to design amendments to protect the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) or to protect the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or merely to agree with Senator Alston because it is what he says we should do. We do not want to disadvantage, or advantage, Mr Cosser. He should be on the same level regulatory playing field as everybody else. We want to set up a level regulatory playing field for satellite, microwave and cable, and for every other type of pay TV delivery system which could be in existence soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present Bill is a halfway house which is heavily biased towards microwave by giving it a 12-month head start without imposing the restrictions which apply to satellite. We want to impose those restrictions. The loophole which inadvertently gave microwave a free kick should be closed, but microwave should be able to compete fully for pay TV market share in its own right. We want to promote media diversity by guaranteeing that the TV networks cannot stall pay TV operations, that existing media players cannot dominate microwave and cable or any other system of pay TV delivery, and that microwave and cable are given full opportunities to compete in the pay TV market, not just as rebroadcasters but in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to increase Australian program content by giving the Australian Broadcasting Corporation a role in pay TV from the outset. The ABC has a guaranteed role in satellite but there is no practical opportunity for it to broadcast nationally on any other system. The ABC is not a rich organisation that has money to throw around. To get into the national microwave system, it would have to go out there, tender and buy licences. I do not believe the ABC has got that money. I wish the Government would give it that money, but the Government is not going to. If the Opposition had got up in the last election, the ABC would have been cut down even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC's role would ensure an Australian news service to compete with CNN and BBC international television. I can tell honourable senators, if they do not already know it, and they should, that CNN and BBC are already being broadcast to some extent in Australia. They will certainly be two of the first channels to be bought up by any player in the pay TV game because they will be relatively cheap. There will be almost no Australian content. But the BBC international news service is a good European news service and the CNN is a very good American news service. They give us the international news. But, if we want Australian news and Australian current affairs, we have to have the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want local drama and children's programs to provide relief from a steady diet of US movies. We all know that the ABC is absolutely expert at doing brilliant children's programming and at doing very good Australian drama. We want that in Australian pay TV right from the outset also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to bring forward a review by the Australian Broadcasting Authority of the present 10 per cent minimum drama content level. We still believe&mdash;we have said this right from the outset and everyone will recall our moving amendments to the original Bill&mdash;that there should be a much higher Australian drama content. We moved for 20 per cent. We still think that is achievable. Every single one of the people who came to the last committee hearings and talked about drama content said that 15 per cent was absolutely achievable. Not one of them said that they could not achieve 15 per cent. Not one of them said that 15 per cent would put them out in the cold. Everybody believed that 15 per cent was totally achievable. We believe that 20 per cent is achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to change the tender process at the moment. If we get these two Bills through today, it will roll along and we will actually have three satellite broadcasters as soon as humanly possible. If we are going to have pay TV at all in this country&mdash;I still do not think we really need it&mdash;and it looks as if we are, it has got to stop being such a horrible mess. It is a dog's breakfast. It has been from day one. We have to clean that up a bit, and we have got to do it today. I am very sick of this whole saga. I am sure the Minister is, I am sure Senator Alston is, and I am sure the whole of the Australian public is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we still believe that 15 per cent is the absolute minimum and we want to bring forward the review by the Australian Broadcasting Authority of the present 10 per cent minimum drama content level as soon as practicable so that the authority can look at putting it up to an absolute minimum of 15 per cent. I would really prefer the authority to look at putting it up to 20 per cent, and I shall recommend that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to ensure that people in rural areas are not unfairly disadvantaged. Microwave can service cities, whereas satellite can service rural areas as well. I know microwave can also service regional areas, and very well; if the transmitter towers are put up, it can service out into rural areas, but it does get expensive. So we want to get satellite in there from the beginning, servicing the rural areas as far as that can be done. If satellite proves viable, it will be extended to national coverage, with 80 per cent of customers needing 60-centimetre dishes. I have got this from Optus and I have seen the maps. A further 10 per cent will need 1.2-metre dishes and the remaining 10 per cent in remote areas will need dishes of between 1.2 and 1.8 metres. But the prospect of national coverage will be reduced if microwave gets a very large head start and significantly reduces the viability of satellite services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to provide the best opportunities to create Australian jobs, export opportunities in South-East Asia and an upgrading of our high-tech manufacturing base. It is there already and is very good; we want to improve that. Because digital transmission by satellite is relatively new, major manufacturers have told us&mdash;in the last two days&mdash;that the rapid commencement of satellite pay TV in Australia makes it likely that manufacturing will occur here, creating hundreds of jobs and opportunities to export as South-East Asian countries start their own digital satellite pay TV systems. High-tech manufacturing techniques which now exist only in Japan will be transferred to Australia. This is a major boost and this is something we want for Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, local manufacturing of satellite reception equipment will be jeopardised if microwave gains a very early foothold, because it will reduce the size of the market for satellite systems. The Australian market is not large enough to ensure that a very early start-up date for microwave will not undermine the prospect of satellite receiving equipment being built here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry tells us that there is little chance of microwave equipment being manufactured here, because it is an old technology for which the market is static at the moment and there are plenty of units on the shelf overseas which could be imported by the big international firms which dominate this market. Mr Cosser tells us otherwise and I hope he is right. If so, microwave as well as satellite will have an industry here which will use Australian pieces of manufacturing and which will create Australian jobs. We would then have Australian jobs created by the satellite industry and the MDS industry, and that would be an excellent thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to restore Australia's reputation as a place to invest. The clear message we have had from industry is that it made its plans on the basis of the Government's stated policy, not on any loopholes created in Bills. We want to encourage investment in Australian TV programming and manufacturing. In fact, the common message from industry was that we should go further and relegate microwave to a position where it could only be used for narrowcasting and rebroadcasting of satellite channels. We have to reject that. That is very unfair. The loophole is there and, if we do close it, there still should be an opportunity for microwave to be used for broadcasting of pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We rejected that model to ensure that microwave can compete in its own right, but on a level regulatory playing field which does not exist at the moment. I come back to that. This is what we have been pushing right from the start: there should be a level playing field for all systems of pay TV delivery. As we have said before, local content goes across the board but it is only 10 per cent. Okay, so that is 10 per cent, but it is a level playing field. The foreign investment level is 35 per cent because that is the general level that is used throughout Australia. But we still have the problem of cross-media ownership. It is in the Bill for satellite and not for anything else. We still want to create diversity of media ownership in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have the problem of local manufacturing content. The industry plan requirement in the Bill for satellite should be a requirement in the Bill for all other methods of pay TV technology delivery. We are going to move in the committee stage to amend the Bill to give us those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to make sure also that the current players, if they do happen to get the satellite licence, cannot stall on the digital transmission standard, as is possible now. It is possible at the moment for someone to get one of those licences and collude and stall on creating a digital standard. If that happened, under the Minister's amendments as they stand, microwave could take forever to start up. That is terribly unfair and that cannot be allowed to happen. We are going to move amendments to change that. We will be moving amendments that are quite different from the Minister's but we hope we will get agreement from both sides. I will get the amendments to everyone as soon as I can. I understand that the committee stage of this Bill will not come on immediately after we finish the second reading, so I expect to have time to get them drawn up properly and to get them around to the different parties. I will be doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Opposition second reading amendment goes, we really want to get the tender system off the ground right now. This has gone on for far too long. It has to be fixed today; it has to be able to go along smoothly from today. If we want ever to have pay TV in this country in a sensible manner and on a level regulatory playing field, with people having a competitive choice right from the beginning, we have to have that tender finished and done with as soon as possible. We will not be supporting sending this off to a committee. We have had a committee that has looked at these things. We went on forever. We decided on a lot of really excellent recommendations, almost none of which were taken up by anybody. If we have another committee the same thing will happen. It is just another committee. We cannot afford to put this off forever, so we will not be voting for that second reading amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still want non-satellite pay TV systems to be subject to the same ground rules as is the satellite system. I cannot say that too many times. Most of all, however, we want a competitive system in this country which protects and advances our cultural and economic interests. We believe we can really do that only if the ABC is involved in a big way right from the very beginning. We still say&mdash;and I will maintain the position&mdash;that this is a disaster because of the way the Minister has taken advice from his department, advice which I think was flawed right from the beginning; because of the way the Prime Minister has fiddled in this whole thing right from the beginning; because of the way there has been the same sort of thing going on in the Opposition, with Dr Hewson coming in and talking to Mr Smith, talking to Senator Alston, when the consideration of the Bill was going on. There was never a plan right from the beginning as to how we could get the best pay TV system for Australia. There still is not. But, if our amendments get through this afternoon, it will certainly be a much better pay TV system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to amend part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 1992 to modify the procedures for allocating satellite pay television broadcasting licences as a result of the current fiasco. A related Bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, seeks to amend the provisions of the principal Act that deal with pay TV and seek to ensure that MDS delivered pay television cannot begin in Australia until the Government's preferred method of delivery&mdash;by satellite technology&mdash;is up and running. This gives legislative backing to the Government's intention in this area, now that the legality of the ministerial determination which was issued by Senator Collins to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, designed to achieve this, has been challenged in the Federal Court. In other words, these Bills are to try to fix up a mess of the Government's own creation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one basic principle that I think the Parliament as a whole should address: the need for government licences of a delivery service where there are no technological reasons for limiting the players. That is a basic principle that the Government has simply not addressed. It has approached this matter as a revenue raising operation, not from the point of view of what is in the best interests of the marketplace, of the people of Australia. To justify the limitation of operatives in any area requires a strong, positive and effective case to be maintained of a need to do it. It is a matter only of social engineering that has prompted the Government, in the satellite situation, to limit the number of players. It believes that it should say to people that there can be only X or Y number of people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the good old days of broadcasting on the AM band, there were only a limited number of places available on the spectrum for broadcasters. It was the same with the initial television situation&mdash;that is, the free to air television situation. What bothers me, as a matter of principle, is the creation of licence situations&mdash;limitation situations&mdash;by government of any persuasion where there is a premium put on the licence itself. Limiting the number of players creates a benefit for the licence holder. We have seen that with taxis and the way that taxi plates have become a negotiable asset. We have seen it with television licences where ludicrous prices have been paid for television licences. The licence is nothing more than a bit of paper granted by a government going through its various structures, forms of investigation and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen a system subject to heavy intervention, even by a Prime Minister in this case. We have a situation where major items of value are handed out by government. That is a basically bad principle, particularly in this situation where we have a government that is run by the New South Wales right wing of the Labor Party. The right wing in the past has established a magnificent reputation for looking after its `mates' and punishing the people it does not see as its `mates'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it requires a very great effort from the regulators to justify intervention in an area where there is no technological requirement for limitation of the number of players. There has been no such effective justification in the matter of satellite television. I can understand why a government would want to put restrictions on such media in terms of material coming across. I can also understand why there is a social policy need for such capacity to intervene; I do not have any problems with that. It is in the public interest for there to be some form of requirement in terms of the broadcasting of material and the imposition of classifications. I believe that prohibition of some forms of material can even be justified in terms of public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see what justification there is for interfering in what should be a free marketplace in the area of satellite activity. If people want to set up a corner store they do not have to get a licence from the Government. But if people want to get involved in satellite TV, they have to pay a premium to the Government in the hope no doubt that the premium they have paid will be worth while and that there may even be added value to that licence&mdash;they may have got it at a fairly low price and may be able to increase the value of it by attracting listeners. To my mind, that is a corruption of the marketplace and, even worse, provides massive opportunities for corruption in government, particularly, as I said, when one has a government controlled by the renowned right wing of the Labor Party in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this potential to create a premium is something that will attract a great deal of interest from major players as well&mdash;people the Labor Party may well regard in some instances as mates and in other areas as potentially hostile. One wonders what the motives that prompted the Government to block Mr Cosser really were, because that is what the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill is all about. The fact is that there is a clear potential for benefiting mates and disadvantaging enemies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly have seen overseas how free the airwaves really are. When I was in Shanghai the year before last I watched Japanese television which was screening&mdash;in Shanghai, China&mdash;the Australia versus New Zealand semifinal in the Rugby World Cup. I must say the Japanese description did not do me much good; it was much better with the sound off. But the fact is that there is a capacity for freedom in the air and this Government has not justified, in my view, any kind of need to limit that freedom. If people want to take commercial risks, let them do so, but why do we have to justify, or how do we justify, this kind of government intervention which gives a benefit to some people and a disadvantage to others?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not these current bidders have a capacity to pay their money and to put on a proper service is a matter which strikes me as almost peripheral, because I think the whole situation is a result of taking a basically wrong policy decision. The fact is, of course, that UCOM and Hi Vision have taken advantage of governmental incompetence. While it is all very well to say that this whole question is being resolved by having an inquiry into the whole matter, which is not going to be subject to this debate, I think it is nonetheless worth noting that, however we try to fix this sort of problem, whatever we do, when a government intervenes there will be consequences which raise questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of great concern to me, but it has been put to me that it is very hard to find someone to run an inquiry into this sort of matter who does not have some involvement one way or another with some of the participants, or potential participants. Even a man as distinguished as Professor Pearce, for example, who is probably the most outstanding administrative law academic we have, has the potential to be involved one way or another. I just think we are crazy to open these opportunities. The legal firm to which he is a consultant has an association with maybe one of the potential people who may benefit from the changes that are taking place. In other words, no matter how distinguished, how significant, the person selected to fix up this kind of mess or to examine this kind of mess, we will always have someone who will be alleged to have some kind of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why, in my view, the Government should not intervene in these things. If there was a free market here there would be no capacity for anyone to make any slurs on anyone&mdash;for anyone to suggest whether the Government is favouring anyone or not. That is one of the key benefits of a free market and it is one of the key disadvantages when governments unnecessarily intervene in an area where there is no limitation on the spectrum. That is the key concern that I have on this matter. Senator Bourne says she does not want chaos; she wants government intervention. I know the Democrats want government intervention.

It is all very well for the Government or the Democrats to say, `We have to intervene here; otherwise there may be too many players, the quality may go down, and who knows what might happen'. What we have seen here is the classic answer to that. The Government is going to get more chaos, more mess, more intervention, more nonsense, more allegations of corruption, fraud and incompetence than it would if it allowed the market to settle the problem. Let the Australian consumers decide what programs they want to watch. The Government can intervene on the basis of content.

Australians have to be blessed by the Government. That is absolutely ludicrous. It flies in the face of the basic principles that I think we should be addressing in this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill represents just another part of the fiasco with regard to pay television that we have seen emerge as the result of the Government's policies and maladministration, particularly over the last 10 days or so. The Bill relates to a different part of that fiasco from the one we have been dealing with and focusing on over the past 10 days. Nevertheless, it is just another part of the collapsed deck of cards that is this Government's so-called framework for pay television. We cannot excuse this Bill, let alone support it, any more than we can excuse the sorts of behaviour and maladministration that have been evident over the last couple of weeks with regard to the issue of satellite pay TV licences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today is to be condemned equally with government interference and government manipulation of the marketplace. It is also manifestly unfair to those who went ahead with investment and planning for multipoint distribution service delivery of pay television following the passage of the Broadcasting Services Bill in November last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out to the Senate that, especially in the past five years, in this chamber we have had to deal with a constant stream of amendments which the Government has needed because of unintended consequences of poorly drafted, ill-conceived, ill-advised or rushed pieces of legislation across a whole range of issues. That is simply not how governments are supposed to operate. Now we have got another amending Bill, albeit at this time for rather different reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes&mdash;and certainly I would argue&mdash;that this is an amendment Bill of supreme cynicism and with just one purpose: to allow the Government to continue to manipulate the whole pay television process. Because of actions such as this, the whole pay television situation is in increasing disarray. The crisis management MDS handling is indicative of the Government's determination to orchestrate for its own purposes, or for the purposes of some outside parties, the delivery into Australian homes of pay television services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill seeks to make law the quite flagrantly out-of-line announcement by the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, in January that microwave television technology would not be allowed to proceed until satellite television is, to all intents and purposes, established&mdash;however long that might take. Why is the Government trying to do this? Why is it seeking to halt a new technology that could have installed cheap, workable pay television to most major cities within the next nine months&mdash;at least two years before any satellite television is available?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in March, in the Federal Court in Perth, Justice Lee stated that the Minister, Senator Collins, had acted beyond his power in attempting to halt MDS technology. But those remarks, and the court action of Mr Kerry Stokes and Mr Steve Cosser, have not caused the Government to reconsider its decision. If anything, the Government has simply dug in deeper. It has proceeded with this amendment and, at the same time, is losing no public opportunity to make sure that the Australian community is left with the impression that all they would get from MDS technology on their screens is ghosting and squiggly lines or, worse, no access at all. It is attempting to discredit MDS as the poor relation of pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tried another line of offence by stating this week that MDS technology could not be the primary pay television service because it could not supply all of Australia. If we apply that ridiculous logic, the Nine, Seven and Ten networks would never have been allowed a licence in Australia&mdash;they have never been able to cover all of Australia. What is offered in some rural parts of Australia is far from the choice or quality available in major cities. By such actions of the Prime Minister and the Minister, Senator Collins, it is apparent that, at all costs, the Government is bent on not only halting the delivery of pay television through MDS technology until satellite technology is operational, but also leaving around enough suspicions about its value so as to damage it as a competitor to satellite in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defeat of this legislation is the only way that that has any hope of being turned around. At the same time, we need to consider what this type of legislation indicates. The ramifications of this legislation being passed are far wider than just pay television. We need to be extremely wary of being seen to allow governments the power to have this level of control in the marketplace. We also need to be wary of allowing this level of control over what is and what is not considered acceptable technology. It is the equivalent of saying that there should be no rotary engines in cars, and it is just as ludicrous as if the Government had said that we could only have VHS and not Beta video systems, AM but not FM radio, and tapes but not compact discs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When technology interference by government begins, where does it stop? For whose benefit is this interference? It is certainly not for the benefit of the public; we can be sure of that. It is simply not good enough to keep saying&mdash;as this Government does continually&mdash;that television is different. Why is it different? We have had no explanation from the Minister that is even half valid or half logical about that amazing assertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has always maintained that a technology neutral stance is the appropriate one. We do not believe it is this Parliament's role to do anything less. In other words, we are not about trying to favour one technology over another. We do not see that as either a government's role or a government's right. We are not about trying to impose our views on what is the best pay television system. That is the right of the community. It is, after all, the general community of consumers who choose what is best for them, as they do with every other commodity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Government saying that in this particular instance the community does not have the intelligence to make an informed choice about what it wishes to purchase as a pay television service?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is guilty of all of the above; and again we have to ask why. Whose bidding is it doing? What does it expect to achieve? How on earth is any of this to help the community, which simply wants access to pay television without one delay on top of another, as it is currently experiencing? What exactly is behind this interference, this insistence on putting the Government's stamp of approval or otherwise on what is a purely commercial venture? So far we have had no answer forthcoming as to why the Keating Government has decided that digital satellite technology is the only acceptable method for pay television in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be accepted that, when the Broadcasting Services Bill was passed late last year, it passed without anyone realising that microwave technology was suitable for far wider broadcasts than narrowcasting, such as in hotels, schools or convention centres and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if that were the case, the fact would be quite irrelevant now; and it would have been just as irrelevant then. Is the Government saying there must be no competition to satellite in the marketplace at this point, because that certainly appears to be the case? How can it say this with its satellite licence procedures totally discredited, as we have seen over the last 10 days or so, its first two licence choices looking increasingly less certain as realities, and the Optus satellite in fragments somewhere in the wilds of China? Satellite pay television looks further away each day&mdash;not closer&mdash;while MDS technology is a reality for right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also not good enough for the Government to say that it is saving us from ourselves by ambushing MDS technology because of alleged inferior broadcast quality. If someone such as Steve Cosser, who has acquired 12 of the 19 MDS licences available in both Sydney and Melbourne, wishes to invest his capital to supply MDS to those cities, why should he not do so? Let the viewers be the judge. If it is inferior quality when in difficult line of sight situations, no doubt Mr Cosser and others so inclined to invest their money in MDS will lose heavily as the public rejects the system. That is no different from a car manufacturer which invests in a new model which the public rejects or, for that matter, a new brand of cornflakes awaiting the market's decision on its quality. Pay television is a commodity and ought to be treated in no other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must, therefore, surely remain the public's right to have that choice. Is that not what the marketplace is supposed to be all about? The Minister's continued insistence that he wants the best quality broadcast for Australians frankly smells. He has not been so keen on other issues to convert Australia into a nanny state, so why is he starting now with pay television?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a family in a major city wishes to spend $400 on a decoder to receive microwave television this year, rather than $1,000 for a dish and a decoder for satellite when it does eventually arrive, so what and why not? Senator Collins has made much in past years in this chamber about his social conscience. We have to ask: how real is that social conscience? Has he considered that he may be depriving the less affluent in our community of access to pay television by stamping on the least expensive option for the consumer? Or is social conscience so selective in this case that he believes that if a family has $400, it must then have easy access to the other $600 to pay for eventual satellite technology? Has he even considered that maybe many consumers would be happy with the less expensive option&mdash;happy to trade some broadcast quality for dollars, if they have to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got to realise that in California MDS has been found to have a quality at least as good as satellite transmission. Some have judged it as being superior even to other pay television systems. There are no complaints about poor quality in California. In fact, it seems it was a visit to California to see MDS in action that created strong interest from Australia's Channel 9 in that system. As each facet of the debate is dissected, the Government's case is displayed to be totally without substance, whichever angle and whichever argument is used and considered. We may understand better the desperation to promote only satellite if we were privy to why the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) personally and so blatantly interfered to stop MDS. The Minister cannot expect us to believe, surely, that the Prime Minister's widely reported fury at discovering in January that MDS could be used for pay television was simply because he did not want a supposed inferior quality pay television broadcast at home in the Lodge. I am sure Mr Cosser is as interested as we in the coalition are to know which outside interest leaned on Mr Keating to lean in turn on the department and then Senator Collins so that he accomplished such an athletic backflip on policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time this Government faced reality. As far as pay television is concerned, it is lose, lose, all the way. As it appears at this stage, before we have the results of the independent inquiry in relation to satellite transmission of pay television, by not insisting on a five per cent non-refundable deposit from the licence bidders for satellite transmission the department has managed to slam the first satellite doors on the established media players. The resulting fallout means that they are turning their attention also to MDS. If they cannot have satellite they want some other stake in pay television. With some 220 MDS licences available in all the capital cities and other major population bases, it is expected that competition will be intense. It adds up to yet another fiasco created by the interference of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we want of government is regulations which provide viewers with guidance and programming protection, regulations which are about standards of service, not regulations which interfere with the technological delivery of those services. There are seven different delivery systems for pay television in existence and all should be treated equally and separately when anyone in the business community is willing to develop them further and risk capital in seeking to develop those facilities. Government is not about creating monopolies; but in the case of pay television it seems that government is also not about admitting its own mistakes. Therefore, it is essential that this legislation be condemned and, indeed, be defeated in this chamber. </PARA>

However, I have to say that I do not disagree with Senate Bourne's assertion that everybody is sick of it. I had this brought to my attention in a very direct way just the other day on an aircraft flying between two of our major cities, which I spend half my life doing. Senator Nick Bolkus was sitting next to me on the aircraft and one of the flight attendants came up just to have a chat.

He just had the dreadful bad taste to put into one book the greatest collection in the world of truth about politics. I was looking through this book and I found a reference in Machiavelli to pay television. I looked in the index under P, and there it was.

There is an assertion that this Government has uniquely attracted criticism about this matter and that this Minister has uniquely attracted criticism about it. That is nonsense.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, I think, a fundamental reason for that and it is to be found in Machiavelli, in one of the more famous quotes from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Prince</EMPHASIS>. Some years ago, when I told someone in my office that I regarded this book as being the best political text available, I was presented with a bound copy of it to replace the tatty old paperback that I had. This is what Machiavelli said about the media:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be borne in mind that there is nothing more difficult to arrange, more doubtful of success and more dangerous to carry through than initiating changes in a state's constitution. The innovator makes enemies of all those who prospered under the old order and only lukewarm support is forthcoming from those who would prosper under the new. Their support is lukewarm, partly from fear of their adversaries, who have the existing laws on their side, and partly because men are generally incredulous, never really trusting new things unless they have tested them by experience. In consequence, whenever those who oppose changes can do so, they attack vigorously and the defence made by the others is only lukewarm. So both the innovator and his friends are endangered together.</PARA>
<PARA>They are true words. I want to turn to an issue of real substance. It is very important to me because it is currently being tested in the Federal Court. I was prejudged on this issue yesterday by someone here who made an outrageous assertion about evidence that I gave under oath in the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the House yesterday, it is not appropriate for His Honour Mr Justice Wee Willie O'Cheescake to come into the Parliament and make outrageous assertions. They were outrageous and totally out of order, but I let him go. Senator Alston alleged this morning, in a much more proper manner but, in effect, as defamatory a manner&mdash;not that it is defamatory here because it is privileged&mdash;that I actually influenced my legal advisers to give me advice that suited my case to make the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might have done things as a Minister that people can now judge as being sensible or silly, but I could not contemplate&mdash;and I use that word in its strongest form&mdash;as a Minister, taking a direction which, according to specific advice that I had been given, was not lawful. I could not contemplate in any way influencing, or even attempting to influence, the outcome of such advice. To me, as a Minister, that is just unthinkable. Senator Alston said that there was not one skerrick of evidence in the Federal Court transcript. That is not correct. I refer Senator Alston to the evidence I gave. I know it well now; it is on page 65 of the transcript. I said that I had been advised in writing that I had express power to do what I did&mdash;in the most important document of all. That was the actual minute I signed, approving this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My department, which has its own legal department, would never have given me that advice&mdash;ever&mdash;if it had not considered that the direction was lawful. I told the Federal Court that I had had subsequent legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department. As it happens, it was advice that had the concurrence of the acting Solicitor-General, Mr Dennis Rose QC, a person who, from barristers I have spoken to, is very highly regarded in the private bar as a constitutional expert. I told the court that. But it would not be proper, and I think Senator Alston would agree with me, to make public the details of this advice, which I have in my hand, seeing that it is still under consideration by the judge. That would not be appropriate, but there is nothing wrong with me reading out the short answers because I told the Federal Court in the witness box that I had had such advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just make a final point in terms of these really outrageous assertions&mdash;and they are serious. They are also before the Federal Court. The Federal Court has three matters before it. The first and second of those three matters are to do with the legal decision of the court in respect of the lawfulness of my direction. The third one is the reason I went to court when I did not have to. I was not called by the applicants. My own barristers told me that whether I went or not was a matter entirely for me. They said that I did not have to and did not need to, but they said that I had to make a decision on the third matter as to whether I voluntarily went to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that when I read the applicant's submission I got very angry indeed. There have been a lot of angry people, and some of them might consider themselves to be rightly aggrieved by what has happened, but I get angry too when I am accused of abusing my office. Making a wrong decision is different. Ministers get accused of that all the time and quite often are guilty of committing it. No doubt I have been and will be. I have been in Parliament 16 years and on both sides of the House, in opposition and government, I have had, despite my rough tongue at times, a very high regard for parliamentary process, a very high regard for the distinction between the Parliament and the courts, and a very high regard for the principles of ministerial responsibility. When I saw in a written submission to the Federal Court an accusation, which has to be tested by the Federal Court, that said that I abused my office, that I issued a direction knowing that it was unlawful, I said to my lawyers, `Try to stop me from going into the Federal Court', and I did. </PARA>

One of those options, and Senator Bourne will recall it, was issuing a direction to proscribe MDS technology to narrowcasting only. That means to prevent it from ever being used&mdash;and I see Senator Bourne nodding in agreement&mdash;as a broadcast medium for pay television. That gets to the heart of how badly this debate has gone about what my position was.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. I might regret it now, but I do not regret it now. It was the right decision to reject that at the time, and with the greatest respect to Senator Bourne, I assert it now. I said to Senator Bourne, `I really do not want to agree to that'. I have not said this publicly before, but this is what happened. I said, `I do not want to agree to that'. Senator Bourne is sitting there so she can get up and call me a liar if I am lying. That is why I am saying it while she is here. I said, `I do not want to agree with that'. Why? Firstly, it is not fair to the holders of the current MDS licences, like Steve Cosser and others. `We cannot do that'. I said they should have their place in the sun, along with the satellite, to compete in a technologically neutral model&mdash;Senator Chapman. I will talk about the furphy that has been run because an impression has been created in the public mind that somehow everything I have done has been to knock MDS out as a broadcast medium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne knows exactly the reverse is the case. I said it is not fair to Steve Cosser, that it is not fair to anyone holding the MDS licences to knock them out. Further, we should not prevent the establishment of a hybrid system of satellite to MDS as a rebroadcaster. We know there are parts of Australia, such as Darwin, Hobart and various other communities, that will not get a strong enough primary signal to get the small dish reception that 80 per cent of the population will get. So we should preserve the right of MDS to be a broadcaster for pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Senator Bourne knows that my central policy decision and principled position on this is exactly the reverse of the assertions that are being made. I had the option to do what I am now being accused of doing, and I rejected it. If I had said yes to Senator Bourne, that is where MDS would be now and would have been since last November&mdash;restricted by legislation. It would not have mattered if the Opposition had opposed it; I had the numbers to carry it, if I had agreed with Senator Bourne. I see her nodding in agreement again. I rejected it, and why? Because I did not think it was fair on Steve Cosser. I have not got an axe to grind for or against Mr Cosser. He is a very well-known identity in the community. I like him; he is a nice bloke. I have only met him once, I think, and talked to him on the phone. He is a decent bloke and he has a right to carry on his business&mdash;and these amendments will not change that. What they will do is give him the right in the way Parliament originally intended. That is not to give anyone an unintentional head start on another technology, which is what we finally did, inadvertently. But it is to allow him to compete along with everyone else&mdash;for the consumers to make a choice. And that is where Senator Chapman missed the point in his contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out the obvious and it is contained in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and in the legislation. Would it have made sense for this Senate to have agreed to excise the pay TV legislation from the Bill, send it off to a Senate committee for months of deliberations in which I would be involved as Minister, to put the ABC in the satellite, to put all sorts of restrictions on it, industry conditions being the most important? The two most important conditions put on the satellite were, in my view, a role for the ABC and the need to involve Australian industry in the product. None of those conditions were imposed on MDS, none of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was not technologically neutral. It was only technologically neutral if it was based on the assumption, on the advice we got, which now was wrong, that MDS would not be a threat to the viability of the satellite. We were all, collectively, wrong about that, except the Democrats. That is why I am making this point at length, because they were concerned it would be a threat to satellite. They doubted the advice that we got, and they wanted to restrict MDS to narrowcasting only and knock it out of any role in pay at all, and I rejected that. Despite everything that has happened now I want to say this: despite all the criticism, despite the heat that is being put on, I know that was the correct decision to reject that opportunity that was put in front of me, because I can tell you none of this would have happened. All the screaming would have been last November, not now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is fair, because it would not have been technologically neutral. All that these amendments do, as Senator Alston would know, is to assert firmly, in legislation, the position we all thought we were adopting last year. That is, it will be truly technologically after these amendments are passed, in that pay TV can be delivered by broadcast MDS but only on an equal footing with all other technologies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to modify the procedures for allocating satellite pay television broadcasting licences. This matter arises directly as a result of the current, long running fiasco in relation to the tender process for pay television licences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that those who have a knowledge of the history of broadcasting in this country would be able to cast their minds back to the late 1980s, when we had an auction system for AM-FM conversion for radio licences. The experience on that occasion was that, at the height of the boom of the market, there were those who were prepared to pay extraordinary sums of money. Indeed, the successful bid for the first licence in Melbourne was by 3KZ, which paid $31 million. The second highest bid was one lodged by Bond Media, which at that time was required to lodge a deposit of $10,000. Subsequently, Bond Media was not in a position to come up with that amount of money and after a significant period of time the bid fell over. It then went to the next in line, which happened to be the then 3DB. It paid about $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lesson from all that was that a great deal of delay and inconvenience was caused, and a great deal of uncertainty by the market, because of what was regarded as a highly desirable tender process. As a result of that lesson learned by the department, it was decided in relation to the MDS licences that there would be a requirement for a five per cent deposit to be paid up front. That was in order to ensure that those who bid for the licence were genuine, that they were serious long-term players and that they had the financial capacity to at least come up with a small proportion of the amount that they were claiming to be able and prepared to pay in due course, if they were ultimately granted the licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an approach that made a great deal of sense and commended itself to the department and, indeed, to this very Minister, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), who signed the determination authorising that approach to be adopted in relation to MDS licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to what then happened, there is no doubt that in reaching that position the Minister took advice, as any reasonable Minister would&mdash;advice such as any sensible department would offer. That advice accompanied the determination. One presumes that he read both the advice and the determination before signing it and he was, therefore, fully seized of the intention of the department, the preferred approach, one that the Government itself chose. No doubt he was mindful that the department ought to have learnt from history and would not make the same mistakes again. So there we had a Minister, not inexperienced&mdash;one who has been a Minister of the Crown for three years or more&mdash;who had been in this portfolio for some months already and was then consciously turning his mind to the requirement for a five per cent deposit to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened, nonetheless, was that on 19 January the Minister was provided with the determination, accompanied, one can only presume, by advice from the department, which he read. If that is not the case we will presumably hear about it in due course but it is unthinkable that any Minister could simply sign a document without taking other advice. Indeed, there are a number of sources of advice. If one is in any doubt the advice ranges from the experts that Ministers are able to employ on their personal staff to the department, where one has as many experts as can be afforded within budget constraints to advise on all manner of technical and policy decisions. In addition, there is nothing to stop a Minister from going to the outside industry and seeking further advice if so minded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a situation where a determination is presented, one is expected to read that before signing it, otherwise we do not need Ministers. We simply authorise bureaucrats to sign documents and, presumably, if they get it wrong they get the chop. So there is a very clear line of responsibility. That is why we have secretaries to the departments. There are circumstances in which, even through no fault of their own, departments are seen to be under-performing and secretaries get moved around. There is no shortage of sheeting home responsibility to those who are nominally in charge. In this situation, this Minister was presented with a determination which he signed on 19 January. He has given various explanations, one of which has been that he checked it for completeness. He has shied away from conceding outright that he did not read a word of it, but he has effectively said that he did not read the document&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said then that I read it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How long did it take to read it? The point is that one can read, one can glance, one can look at a document. I presume the Minister is saying he did not comprehend the significance of it. If that is the case, one has to ask why, because this is not just another piece of paper. This is arguably the most significant document in the history of satellite pay television in this country, because this is what gets the game formally under way. This is what brings applicants into the game and this is what requires people to apply their minds to very large sums of money, not just in the short term, but over a much longer period of time. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Minister was not being presented with just another piece of paper, just another one of the many documents that are presented to Ministers. He was being asked to address his mind to the formal start of the process, the determination that would get the whole game up and running. What did he do? He apparently read, without comprehending, a very significant clause that simply required the payment of a nominal handling charge of $500. Any reasonable person would expect that a Minister of experience, a Minister who had been through this very same process in relation to MDS licences, would be acutely aware, not just of the history of the matter, but of the necessity to have in place a sensible requirement such as a five per cent deposit. Yet for reasons that are not yet clear, he simply chose to sign that document and to return it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know whether he had advice. He says staff members were not present. Presumably the whole department was not away on vacation. Even if those people were, they are expected to be on call. Similarly, staff members are expected to be on call; they get overtime built into their salaries. Of course, one would expect them to be ready at all times to cast their eyes over important documents. It is no excuse in the slightest to suggest that somehow, because one staff member is away, a Minister is absolved from applying his independent mind, discretion and judgment to a very significant cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important aspect of this Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 is that it is clearly sheeting home direct responsibility to this Minister. He has spent the last 10 days or so trying to blame everyone but himself, trying to shuffle responsibility off to his department, setting up an inquiry to identify all the shortcomings of the bureaucrats. At all times he has been absolutely determined, not only not to acknowledge any breach of ministerial responsibility, but not even to answer questions on the subject, under the dubious and quite wrong basis that somehow that committee overrides the processes of the Senate and the Senate estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, there is absolutely no reason at all why the Minister should not be accountable to the Senate, why he should not provide explanations on these matters. But he has chosen, for damage control purposes, to hide behind the establishment of a committee. One can understand the political imperatives in all that, but suffice it to say it is simply nowhere near good enough. If the doctrine of ministerial responsibility means anything in this day and age, it means that Ministers ought to be responsible for their own decisions. If they sign important documents, they ought to take advice beforehand, and they accept the consequences of their actions. In the situation where the Minister chose not to insert a five per cent deposit requirement, a number of very important consequences flowed. They were that all of the potential applicants then structured their bids around the rules of the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can be critical of that because that is normal commercial sensible practice. Naturally enough, what we had was a whole series of people putting in up to 50 bids when all the experts were guessing that there might be only one applicant for licence B and there was a bit of speculation about two or three international heavyweights who might put in for licence A. Everyone was astounded to discover that there were 50-plus bids. Indeed, the informed speculation is that, of those, 19 are multiple collapsible bids. In other words, it was a complete farce&mdash;perfectly proper within the rules, but nonetheless one that presumably this Minister, in his wildest dreams, would not have contemplated if he had bothered to comprehend what he read. Indeed, in my judgment, if one does not comprehend, one has not read&mdash;one has looked at the document; and that is nowhere near good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that, the rules having been set and the processes put in train, the rules of the game simply cannot be changed midstream. This is not expressed to apply to the current prospective winners, UCOM and Hi Vision, but of course what this Bill does say is that they are expected to fall over. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The guilty conscience is very evident up front. Almost in the first couple of lines of the press release that announced this immediate and knee-jerk response to Terry McCrann's article we find the Minister saying that this is not in any way intended to reflect on the commercial capacity of these two bidders. That is put in purely and simply because the Minister was acutely conscious of the fact that that was precisely what it did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we say is that it is not proper to pass judgment in that way. It is certainly not proper to introduce amendments before the event has even occurred. Whether or not we might all think it will happen or is likely to happen, whether or not we think these bids are utterly unrealistic, whether or not they are much, much higher than anyone had reasonably anticipated, and whether they are multiples of the bids that were put in by those that might be regarded as serious players, the fact remains that the tender process allowed for bids of $177 million and $212 million respectively to be put on the table. What the Minister then says, in effect, is: `We will assume that that will fall over because then we will put in place arrangements that will ensure that those who come afterwards will have to put up five per cent within three days'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If what I have said is checked, it will be found that I said that there was a widespread expectation in the community, and certainly amongst the players in the game, that that was what would happen. If the Minister wants to say that they will fall over I would be very interested to hear it, because that would seem to be the only possible basis for introducing this amendment at this time. Otherwise he would wait and see, and when the 30 days had expired and these bids had not been successful, he would be proceeding with amendments. He is introducing them at this stage only because he takes the view that A and B will not survive. Not only is that prejudging the matter but, as I have said, it certainly does not make their capacity to raise funds in the marketplace any easier. I would have thought that it simply demonstrates the panic-mode, knee-jerk response to an article written by Terry McCrann, less than 24 hours after which we had the Minister's press release being put out. If ever there was policy making on the run, then this is it. It is certainly not the first time and I am sure it will not be the last. The important thing to remember is that, once a process has been set in train and once the rules of the game have been established, they simply cannot be changed without it being a retrospective process.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What if you find out it is wrong? Do you just let it go?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister decided it is wrong? Has he decided that A and B should not be allowed to proceed, should not be allowed to come up with the money, because, if so, this is all irrelevant, utterly academic, and of no importance at all? This Bill can only ever be relevant if those applicants fall over. From that point on a whole series of things might happen, but the fact remains that, if there are 50, the next 48 went into the process on certain defined terms prescribed by the Minister. They have their acquired rights, they are entitled to assume that those rights will not be affected midstream; and yet that is what this amendment proposes to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes it clear that the Government wants to change the rules simply because of what it now acknowledges to have been a monumental error. But one does not change the rules part way through the process. One does not assume, for example, that if these two do not get to the barrier it might be another two or three years because everyone will take 30 days plus 45 days and maybe even longer, and that process will simply multiply right down to the bottom. None of those assumptions can be made because, again, that would be second-guessing what will happen as a result of the process the Government has established. Therefore, not only is it premature to be introducing them before the 30 days expires but it is quite unfair to those with acquired rights. The Minister is attempting to make judgments about what will happen down the track when he has absolutely no idea. He does not know whether any bids will be withdrawn. He does not know whether there will be rearrangements. All of these consortiums are very fluid and are perfectly capable of being restructured on short notice&mdash;</PARA>

The fact remains that the Act itself allows for licences to be transferred, for bids to be withdrawn and for restructuring of arrangements to take place at any time. In those circumstances, the last thing the Minister ought to be doing is making yet another assumption about what will flow after the 30-day period and then introducing amendments that somehow are designed significantly to restrict the activities of subsequent applicants. Therefore, we will be voting against this Bill. Not only is it retrospective but, clearly, it is interfering with rights of all those who are currently bidders. It is, therefore, manifestly unfair. The Minister must stop making policy changes on the run and acknowledge that responsibility stops with him and that he cannot simply blame his department and everyone else.

They know what they can do. They know whom they can talk to. They know how to negotiate. The last thing we ought to be doing is somehow prescribing, or proscribing, the way in which those processes should proceed. Yet that is what this Bill does, simply because once again the Minister has got it wrong and wants to patch it up on the run. That is why it makes a great deal of sense to sit back and have a good think about these things, to let the process take its course, as the Minister intended when he signed that fatal determination. If he does that, I am sure that matters will work themselves out, that we will get licences issued in the not too distant future and that we will have a process that is in accordance with the rules established by the Government. But to change the arrangements at this stage not only is unfair but is further confirmation of the panic mode that is gripping the Government at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This second broadcasting Bill which we have before us this afternoon, the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, simply reflects the fiasco that the Government's policy and administration of the introduction of pay TV has become over the last couple of weeks. Since Parliament resumed last week, we have seen a most unedifying spectacle. Not only the Minister at the table today, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins), but also in the other place the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall) have been ducking and weaving and stonewalling to cover up their incompetent administration of this pay television area, refusing to answer quite legitimate and serious questions on the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the shadow Minister, Senator Alston, outlined in some detail a little while ago, the issues and this legislation itself have arisen basically because two unknowns, UCOM and Hi Vision, were the successful bidders for the two satellite pay television licences which were to be issued purely on the basis of price based bids. However, because of the way in which this tendering process was conducted, we have absolutely no guarantee that these two players can actually deliver their bids. We do not have even the somewhat limited guarantee of a five per cent deposit of the bid amount being required of the bidders. Hence the fiasco that we have seen over the past 10 days, with the Minister refusing point blank to answer quite relevant and legitimate questions about this issue, both day after day in this chamber and on Tuesday night in the Senate estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Minister has set up his own pet inquiry is no justification for failing to answer questions put to him, either here or in the estimates committee, especially when they are simple questions of fact such as I asked at the Senate estimates committee on Tuesday night. Perhaps it is worth relaying several of those questions to the Senate just so that we can understand how simple and direct they were and how easily answerable they should have been. Among those were questions such as: on what date was a decision reached within the department not to require a five per cent deposit for any successful television licence applicants under the satellite proposals? On what research was the decision not to require a deposit based? What were the department's grounds for making such a decision? And finally: what was the department's specific purpose in not requesting a deposit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are very simple questions. They are basically questions of fact which the Minister and his department ought to have been able to answer, but they refused point blank to answer them. We were able to establish on Tuesday night that this is the first time a price based tender system has not required a deposit to establish the bona fides of the bidders, at least in the past few years. Also, according to Senator Collins on Tuesday, his transport and communications department is a highly competent, highly efficient department which is at the cutting edge, as he claimed, of fostering micro-economic reform. </PARA>

If that is the case, the only logical conclusion we can reach is that the failure to require a five per cent deposit was not an error, it was not an omission, it was not a blue by the department. On the contrary, we can conclude only that it was a conscious and deliberate decision. The relevant question to ask is: why was this decision made?</PARA></TALK.START>

Obviously, those reasons would be known. The representatives of the people in this place have a right to know.

If the reasons are good, why is the Government changing now, by bringing in legislation belatedly requiring a five per cent deposit from the next highest bidders, if the UCOM and Hi Vision bids do in fact fall over? As Senator Alston said a few minutes ago, that is the only basis on which this legislation becomes applicable. Why is the Government now changing its position, if it did have good and legitimate reasons for not requiring that deposit at the outset? In the absence of the immediate answers to those very relevant and very legitimate questions, I believe we cannot support this legislation and it ought to be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that not only the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) but the whole of the Parliament has problems at this point of time. I think we should try to overcome the problems as best as we can with the least fall out. Clearly, the issue of ministerial responsibility is not ignored. That will no doubt be a very relevant part of the report of the inquiry, which the Minister has generated, and which he indicated will be presented to the Parliament in a week or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure that we have before us at the moment is an attempt to redress some of the failings that have been revealed in the current legislation and, as such, I am inclined to support them. However, one thing that was said by Senator Alston has concerned me&mdash;perhaps the Minister could address this in his reply&mdash;and that is the issue of retrospectivity. Senator Alston indicated that the measure that is currently before us has an element of retrospectivity. I am not able in my study of the Bill to detect that element of retrospectivity. I will be interested in what the Minister has to say in his reply. I will also be interested to hear whether Senator Alston has anything to add to his comments in the Committee of the Whole&mdash;that there is an element of retrospectivity in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia cannot afford pay TV. However, it is on the road now and it is up to us to do the best we can to ensure that the legislation is sufficient to protect the consumer. I am not sure that the provisions in section 98 that deal with the second phase, which the current applications for the A and B licences are undergoing, are capable of ensuring that. I believe that there should be tighter provisions as to merit in section 98 of the legislation. But, I have no amendments to that effect. I just raise that issue with the Government at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address also the matter of the licensees themselves. It came as some surprise to everybody around the place, I suppose, including the Minister, that one of the five directors of Hi Vision, a company that has been a successful bidder, was a porn merchant of some long standing. That did not come as a surprise to me because I mentioned it in the Senate in 1984, and it should have been known by people who would have been interested in that aspect. I am not suggesting that the Minister should have known it. Perhaps I should have drawn it to his attention, but he has been saying that he is at arm's length from the subject and it was not my province, I believe, to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is the protection of the consumer. The possibility of such companies, with such influence, gaining control of pay TV in a particular area heightens the need for us to have a good look at the legislation and to see whether, in the end, Parliament is able to provide that protection. I am suggesting not that we should go on in a proactive manner but that we should at least have a fall-back position where the Parliament can have a say, particularly over the standards that apply to pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have distributed throughout the chamber an amendment which goes to schedule 2, part 6, of the broadcasting services legislation. In clause 10(g) there is a provision that R-rated material will not be able to be broadcast over pay TV until Australia-wide quantitative and qualitative research on community standards of taste and decency has been conducted by the ABA and the ABA has approved the broadcast of such programs. That is a very important issue. It was, I believe, the intention of the Parliament, on the last occasion when we were discussing this, to have a situation whereby the Parliament has some final say over the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I moved an amendment which was gutted by the Government. Nevertheless, the gutted version now appears as section 128 of the legislation, which enables the standards and codes to be amendable by the Parliament&mdash;standards and codes which apply to all types of broadcasting and television, including commercial, narrowcasting, and so forth. Because that provision is in (g), where the ABA has the final decision, it may be regarded as a standard or code by some, but my advice now is that it is not regarded as a standard or a code. Therefore, it does not come within the scope of section 128. Consequently the Parliament will not even have the minimum fall-back position that is currently available under section 128. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of section 128 is that, even if a resolution is passed in this place, it is not really going to be dealt with unless the Government ensures that it gets on into the House of Representatives. So there are fairly severe checks on the operation of section 128 as it applies. What I am trying to do is to amend the legislation to close that loophole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be quite frank with the chamber. The amendment that has been distributed to honourable senators does state that these programs&mdash;the R-rated programs&mdash;will not be able to be broadcast unless the ABA has recommended and the Parliament has, by resolution of each House, approved the broadcast of such programs. I must admit that that is stronger than if the ABA or the industry had made these a standard or a code of practice which are amendable by the Parliament pursuant to section 128. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to have a fall-back position which would simply eliminate the anomaly and place that decision of the ABA in the same situation as any other decision by the ABA in respect of code of practice and standard. I do not think it can be argued that this would not be a standard&mdash;it is a standard. Clearly, it is a standard. It is just a matter of some clever draftsperson getting hold of section 128(a)&mdash;unless, of course, the chamber wants to agree to this amendment, which I would be happy with. As I say, I have to be honest. It is stronger than what is currently provided for under section 128. I suppose, in fairness, that I would be happy if section 128 applied to that particular decision of the ABA as though it were a standard or code of practice. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that was run here in the Senate today by the Opposition is the thinnest and the most transparent argument I have heard run by the Opposition in any debate in the six years that I have been in the Senate. The Opposition's credibility is absolutely on the line today. The Government's credibility and my personal credibility have been under constant attack now for some time. Decisions will be made&mdash;and, indeed, may well be made by myself in hindsight&mdash;about the Government's credibility and my credibility in terms of decisions taken&mdash;and this, I might add, is a common occurrence&mdash;which looked sensible, rational, reasonable, proper and responsible at the time when events and circumstances were as they were but which, when one looks back on it, have changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But today the credibility of the Opposition is on the line. I was actually half expecting that Senator Alston would walk in here today and say that, although those opposite were going to kick up a stink about it and say that the Government had made errors, they were going to support the Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993. I actually did think he might have done that, because the line that the Opposition is running on this today and the position it is taking is the most irrational, illogical and, in the truest sense of the word, irresponsible position that I have ever seen the Opposition take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent a lot of time in opposition, unlike 90 per cent of my colleagues. I had 10 long years of it&mdash;five as leader.

I often praised it for doing sensible things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I actually cooperated with the Northern Territory Government on this. I supported it in the Parliament. We were the first place in Australia to do something about pornography being sold over the counter. In fact, Senator Harradine will recall the debate when I said that I had raised it in the Northern Territory Parliament after a visit to my local video store in Malak, where I lived. There was a cardboard box of remaindered X-rated videos at the cash register which were being sold for $20 a copy. I raised the matter in the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of cooperation between the then Opposition leader, me, and the then Government&mdash;I gave it public credit for this&mdash;legislation was introduced to restrict the sale of not just X-rated videos but also R-rated videos. I might add that this was against the screams of the video shop operators. I believe it was the first time in Australia that it happened. I think my memory is correct on that. We restricted not just X-rated&mdash;it still happens, Senator Harradine&mdash;but R-rated material so that it had to be put into separate areas, closed off, and not admissible to anyone under the age of 18. My record is very clear on this. Castigate the Government, by all means, for its mistakes&mdash;I have done plenty of that&mdash;but, having kicked it to death, if it proposes something sensible, support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just show the Senate how thin Senator Alston's arguments are and, boy, are they thin! Senator Alston said that one of the reasons he is not going to support this legislation is that it contains an imputation against the financial success, viability and stature of these companies. He knows it does not. The imputation is there, he says, and that is terrible. I thought Senator Alston's public statements, and also Dr Hewson's, about these companies were terrible. I said to my staff, when I had read and heard what Senator Alston had said, `This is outrageous, even for a shadow Minister. He might have his own views about the non-viability of these proposals but it is totally improper for him, even as the shadow Minister, to express them so early after the bids were announced'. This was before there was any question of porn merchants as directors or anything else. This was 24 hours after the bids were announced. It was an outrageous thing for him to say.

If they pass the very intensive scrutiny that is required by the ABA in terms of their being fit and proper people to broadcast, if they pass the TPC, if they do their 30 days and if they come up with the money, they will get their licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston is not specious enough to say, because he cannot, that the legislation prevents them. He says he is opposing this legislation on the grounds that there is an imputation in the legislation that will help them to not get these bids. The shadow Minister has publicly derided the companies and publicly stated that, in his view, the prices they offered were too high. Let us look at the real reason for his doing this: he just wants the confusion and the uncertainty to be continued. This is the most transparent and dishonest argument that has ever been put in here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens after 30 days? I will tell the Senate. This Parliament gets up&mdash;that is what happens after 30 days&mdash;and it does not come back until August. That is the real reason, and he was not honest enough just to come out and say it. What he asserted was that he was concerned about an imputation contained in passing this legislation that these companies cannot get there. But he himself, in what I say was an outrageous statement, literally 24 hours after anyone even knew who they were, said publicly that in his professional opinion they had made too high a bid. In other words, it was not marketable and therefore, in his view, they could not have got the money. It is tissue thin. That is the real reason he does not want it passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get to the point where I come in. Non-stop, crazy assertions have been made, by a shadow Minister who has never been a Minister, about what I have to do at my end. The definition of ministerial responsibility is raised once again. There is probably not a more debated subject in the parliaments of the world than everybody's definition of ministerial responsibility. Let us have a look at that. This week I have signed papers, pages of them, relating to over $50 million worth of roadworks. I will tell the Senate what the reality is. Any Minister deals with an enormous amount of paper. Not only does he deal with an enormous amount of paper but he has got one or two other things that he does at the same time. I will mention one of the other things that he does.</PARA>

Under a responsible system of government, we have also got a few things like constituents. When we are in the middle of an election campaign, we have got a few things to think about, like getting into parliament to ensure that the government's program can be continued.

I saw the $500 and I assumed that it was such a low amount it was just a bookkeeping fee&mdash;that is, a cost recovery method of paying for the shuffling of the paperwork, or helping to, and that it would discourage specious or frivolous bids where anybody could sit down and just shove in $100,000 bids in a frivolous manner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins may wish to hang around and hear some facts about the results of the election on 13 March. That is what I intend to talk about in this matter of public interest. The result in the election revealed that the Labor Party had again scraped into office across Australia with a very narrow margin in a few seats. One wonders, on the law of averages, why the margins are always so small. I think it is a matter that needs to be looked into further. It is a matter that I certainly will be addressing in further contributions in the chamber in the months ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will confine my remarks to the election result in Queensland, where the Liberal Party performed very, very well in the 1993 election. The Labor Party came almost to complete catastrophe in Queensland on 13 March. I will indicate some of the facts. In Queensland the Liberal Party was the only major party to increase its primary vote at the election. The House of Representatives vote increased by 2.7 per cent, to 31.2 per cent, and the Liberal Party increased its number of lower house members by one, including the election of Mr Peter Slipper as the new Liberal member for Fisher. I congratulate Mr Slipper on a very fine win. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party increased its Senate vote in Queensland by 2.2 per cent, to 31.5 per cent, the largest increase recorded by any party in Queensland at this election. I might point out that the Labor Party in Queensland had its vote reduced by 1.1 per cent. It is interesting to note that in, I think, every other State the Labor Party vote went up&mdash;ever so slightly in most of them, I might say, but an increase. As a result of the election, the Liberal Party in Queensland easily maintained its quota of four senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate at this stage the Liberal Senate team led by my colleagues Senator David MacGibbon and Senator Warwick Parer. I also pay tribute to the other members of the Senate team, Mr Ross Cunningham, Mrs Ann Buchanan, Mr Henry Bird and the Reverend Owen Davies, for a fine contribution to the campaign in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the result for the Liberal Party, the Labor Party decreased its House of Representatives vote by 1.1 per cent, to 40.5 per cent, and decreased its number in the House of Representatives by two. The Democrat vote was down quite substantially in Queensland. The Democrats lost, in the House of Representatives election, some 7.5 per cent</PARA>
<PARA>of their support. Support for the Greens went up by only 2.6 per cent, so it did not all flow over there. I think one would find as well that in the Senate the Democrat vote fell quite substantially. Although the Democrats gained a seat there, they gained it on a very low quota margin. I think they started off at well less than one quota but by a drift of preferences throughout they were able to get another senator in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to understand that the improvement by the Liberal Party in Queensland principally came about in rural and provincial areas. In the seat of Capricornia there was a 17 per cent swing to the Liberal Party. It is 17 per cent, I might add, because we did not run a candidate in the previous election. The Liberal candidate who ran for only a few weeks in that Central Queensland electorate achieved a very credible 17 per cent of the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the North Queensland electorate of Herbert, based on Townsville, the Liberal candidate, Peter Hazard, achieved a 6.3 per cent swing to the Liberal Party on top of the 8.7 per cent swing that he obtained in the previous election. In the Cairns based electorate, or Far North Queensland electorate of Leichhardt, the Liberal Party candidate, Bill Cummings, received a very substantial 9.5 per cent swing to the Liberal Party on top of a 13.1 per cent swing in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall swing to the Liberal Party in these three major North and Central Queensland provincial seats was 10.6 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The graphs actually show the results of the votes for the major parties in Leichhardt, Herbert and Capricornia since 1983 and make interesting reading. In the sugar seats of Queensland there was some confusion originally over our sugar policy, but that was overcome when the coalition put a lot of work into the sugar policy and came up with a policy that was substantially beneficial to the sugar industry and was one which the sugar industry accepted very readily. It was a policy that a lot of work was done on and a lot of contributions were made to it behind the scenes by Queensland coalition members. I specifically congratulate Mr Ian McLachlan on the work he did, and also Mr Bruce Lloyd on his contribution to the sugar policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a very strong vote for the coalition in the sugar seats. I make particular reference to the increase in the Liberal vote in the sugar seats of Hinkler and Leichhardt. In Hinkler, the swing to the Liberals was about four per cent and that swing ensured that the new member for Hinkler, Mr Paul Neville, was able to win that seat from Mr Courtice, the former chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force. But I might say, with respect, we are well rid of Mr Courtice, a man who did nothing but divide the bush with his divisive and anti-bush comments. I welcome Mr Paul Neville to this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also make a passing reference to a rather unfortunate trend that appeared in the Herbert electorate in this election. There was a candidate who ran principally, I think one would say, on an anti-Aboriginal, anti-migrant and anti-welfare program. That independent candidate running for the very first time achieved 14 per cent of the primary vote in the electorate of Herbert. That is a trend which needs to be looked at. There are some very strong messages that the Government, and in fact, all people interested in politics should look at. There are many lessons to be learned from that and I will be addressing those lessons somewhere else. I might say that the swing to this independent, who ran on an anti-Aboriginal, anti-migrant, anti-welfare thing, was most strongly shown in the strong Labor booths of Townsville. That is a particularly interesting matter and a matter which, as I say, does require further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make reference to the seat of Groom where I was very pleased to see Mr Bill Taylor again returned very substantially to that west of the divide seat on the Darling Downs. I was also very pleased to see my friend and colleague Mr Alex Somlyay returned in Fairfax with an increased primary vote. His vote is now well over 40 per cent. It is a remarkable effort by Mr Somlyay and my congratulations go to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the next election when, on all the discernible trends, the Liberal Party will win the northern seats of Leichhardt and Herbert, in addition to many others which are really ours for the taking. The seats in Queensland held by the Labor Party are very marginal. Of the 19 seats around Australia with margins of 2.8 per cent or less, seven are in Queensland. Dickson, won by Mr Lavarch at the delayed election by just a handful of votes, is now on a 0.5 per cent margin. The electorate of Leichhardt needs a swing of only 1.4 per cent; Moreton, 1.8 per cent; Petrie, 2.2 per cent; Herbert, 2.4 per cent; Rankin, 2.7 per cent; and Capricornia, 2.8 per cent. I repeat that seven of the most marginal 19 Labor seats are in Queensland. It is fairly obvious that Queensland will play a major role in the defeat of the Labor Party at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to the people of Dickson, Labor does at least have one Queenslander in the Cabinet&mdash;only one&mdash;but he got there by a handful of votes when he won Dickson at the delayed election. I think it is a disgrace to Queensland that the Prime Minister is so bitter at the Queensland right-wing faction, which would not support him in the leadership battles, that he has punished Queensland by putting just one Queenslander in the Cabinet.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that is better than what was done by Mr Hawke, who had none, but I think it is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other Ministry representative from Queensland at the present time is the junior Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall), whose handling of the pay TV issue has been an absolute embarrassment. As a Queenslander, I almost wish that he were not even in the Ministry, because his handling of that is causing concern right around Australia to the industry and, more importantly, is an embarrassment to those of us who are from Queensland, who have to bear the brunt of jokes about this Minister and the way he has handled that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the coalition now has a number of Queensland people in senior positions. In the Liberal Party there are two Queenslanders in the shadow Cabinet, a further Liberal in the outer shadow Ministry and three shadow Parliamentary Secretaries. In addition to that, the National Party has two shadow Ministers, one in the shadow Cabinet. This is a recognition by the Liberal and National parties of Queensland's importance and an indication that Queensland will be crucial to winning the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the trends are that Queensland will be crucial in the next election. Mr Goss, the Queensland Premier, has had a rather remarkable run for the last few years as a new Premier, after many, many years of Liberal and National Party rule. His honeymoon is coming to a very quick end, as I believe Senator Burns would agree. The gloss, as they say, is wearing off. The opinion polls are starting to show that. As Mr Goss gets more and more public servants from Victoria, Labor Party people coming up to be given a sinecure, the Budget and the financial system in Queensland, which have been so good after decades of Liberal and National Party rule, will plummet in the same way as they have done in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. Everywhere the Labor Party goes, it cannot be trusted with money, and Mr Goss is getting there. Mark my words, our fine financial position in Queensland is just about to tumble as the socialist upbringing of people like Mr Goss&mdash;I do not like referring to socialists these days, but it is true&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to make a couple of comments following the comments of the previous speaker, Senator Macdonald. It is true that the coalition did reasonably well in Queensland&mdash;though not quite well enough. The Liberal Party did lift its Senate vote, and it is to be congratulated on that. The National Party won the seat of Hinkler and it won the seat of Kennedy, and it turned the seat of Dawson&mdash;which was marginally held by 80 or 90 votes&mdash;into a fairly good score for the member, Mr Ray Braithwaite, who made a sacrifice on behalf of his electorate and resigned from shadow Cabinet on the sugar position, to which, of course, his electorate responded by giving him an overwhelming vote of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the main issue that I rose to speak on. I would like to raise some concerns about the appointment of Professor Ross Garnaut to head the Government's Wool Industry Review Committee. The long-term future of the wool industry and tens of thousands of growers and their families and rural townspeople will depend very much on the committee's findings. It requires an intimate and practical knowledge of the industry from the ground up, and an appreciation of the importance of restoring confidence and some stability to the industry and its markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Garnaut has held several advisory positions which have made his views on a range of subjects very publicly known. In supporting Australian police advisers in Papua New Guinea he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will involve Australians getting involved in messy situations from time to time. If Australians are going to be advisors in the police force, some Australians will be present when innocent PNG civilians are shot. This is one of the costs.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 9 April, he described the situation in South Africa in the following manner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a lot of intellectual capital in this country and it's engaged in an interesting way.</PARA>
<PARA>In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> he talked about the `mediocre minds'&mdash;referring to the then Minister, Peter Baldwin&mdash;who wanted to change the ANU, where Mr Garnaut is a professor, and about the multifunction polis, the steering committee of which Mr Garnaut was a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Garnaut has also publicised his views on the needs for changes to federalism, fighting the Senate's `permanent Opposition majority' and the Commonwealth diffusion of power as economic constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 2 August 1990 it is clear that Professor Garnaut would very much like to rule Australia from his personal computer, where he could manipulate people and resources just so, without any interference from the parliamentary democracy or `those nasty little States'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he is most famous for being the author of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia and the North East Asian Ascendancy</EMPHASIS>. Like Moses bringing down the 10 commandments carved in tablets of stone, Garnaut's report outlines the tenets of economic rationalism which were taken up zealously by economists, commentators and some politicians. These commandments were embraced widely as everyone sought to find a model for Australia's future direction on the international stage. The most fundamental commandment and, in Garnaut's own words, the single most important step was, `Thou shalt have no tariffs'. Micro-economic reform on the waterfront and other labour markets and in areas of transport and communications was also important. But Garnaut said that it was not necessary to bring down the tariffs in tandem with micro-economic reform; and that is where John Hewson differed. So long as the tariffs went, Australia would be forced to become internationally competitive; that is, whatever was left of Australia's industry. Other economic rationalist commandments included, `Thou shalt have no export incentive or subsidy schemes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strangely, though, Garnaut softens this when a personal interest takes hold. He encouraged the Government to provide export insurance for those businesses exporting to Papua New Guinea, the site of his early career. He said, `Thou shalt deregulate everything. Thou shalt not allow any form of statutory marketing structures to enable farmers to control the marketing of their own produce in the face of oligopolistic collusion from large buyers'. On the imperfections of the deregulated financial system, Garnaut writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian banks were not strong enough professionally to make the transition smoothly to a deregulated system.</PARA>
<PARA>This was in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 6 March. As chairman of the R&amp;I Bank of Western Australia, which made huge losses as a result of unwise lendings and investments, he should know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said, `Thou shalt pause not for the fate of those driven to bankruptcy and unemployment'. In an interview on Prue Goward's morning radio show on 15 May 1990, Garnaut admitted that there might have been some casualties in the car industry had protection come down faster. When asked for an example, Garnaut replied, `I don't want to speculate about the details. It's impossible to know without the pressures having actually been applied'. Will Garnaut also not want to speculate about the details of woolgrowers forced to leave the land because of some economic rationalist approach? These details are vitally important because they apply to thousands of people with a life's investment and know-how. Will Garnaut be unable to speculate about the effects of his wool recommendations? As in the car industry, it is impossible to know before it happens. This is simply unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During an address in Western Australia in 1990, Professor Garnaut made another breathtaking statement to the economic rationalist disciples: there shall be no anti-dumping arrangements. Honourable senators on both sides of this chamber have worked extremely hard to set up effective anti-dumping arrangements. The Senate formed a committee to examine this important area, and there were subsequent legislative improvements. Both sides of politics are committed to preventing the flood of subsidised imports from wiping out Australia's horticultural and other rural industries, which are also among the world's most efficient producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again, the Senate has been told of the enormous subsidies being paid in foreign countries that enable their producers to sell at lower prices. Those products, even if not bought into Australia, affect the domestic price. I believe that the Minister for Trade (Senator Cook) will have something to say about that today. To remove anti-dumping arrangements and have zero tariffs and allow micro-economic reform to catch up at will is a recipe for untold disaster in all aspects of Australian industry. Economic theories may be brilliant, men's minds may be brilliant, but such brilliance shatters when faced with the practical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do Garnaut's commandments for economic rationalism make any room for humanity, for moderation or for non-economic issues? Australia is not an economic model. Australia is living tissue, blood and spirit. We must not open the Pandora's box of these economic extremists too far. The Government has baulked at some aspects of economic rationalism. For example, the car, clothing, textile and footwear industries will not face zero tariffs by the year 2000. Yesterday in the Senate, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) repeated his Government's commitment to an effective anti-dumping scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of Ross Garnaut as the head of the Wool Industry Review Committee is sending out all sorts of worrying messages to the woolgrowers, buyers and processors. What sorts of solutions will such a public advocate of economic rationalism and its theoretical extremism promote for the beleaguered wool industry? Will he come up with a dangerous and industry-threatening idea like his proposal to remove anti-dumping arrangements? Will the wool stockpile be thrown into a fully deregulated and privatised market? Will there be no more promotion funds? Will there be no generic advertising for wool? Will 50 per cent of producers be sentenced to the city dole queues while the market reasserts itself? Will properties lie vacant and deteriorating under sentence of economic rationalism? Will rural towns shrivel and die, their businesses bankrupt, their people unemployed, simply because there was a drought, a short-term wool price problem and an economic rationalist?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Garnaut will say that we need to develop new wool related, perhaps processed, export industries. But how will that happen within his economic rationalism war where there are no tariffs, no anti-dumping, no government assistance or export subsidies, in a climate where micro-economic reform is proceeding far too slowly to make us competitive with established processors? Professor Garnaut stated in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 30 November 1990 that he is against any broad scheme of industry assistance. Will there be a wool industry in 10 years time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans said the other day that he was sure Professor Garnaut would take the parameters of government policy into account when making his recommendations. But the professor has the floor on this one. There is no government policy on the future of the industry. That is Professor Garnaut's brief. Can a leopard change its spots? Can a man who is famous from promoting a strict economic rationalist approach do less than that? There has been no sign of his deviating from his cherished commandments, no admission that he was in error over advocating the removal of anti-dumping arrangements. I fear greatly for the future of the wool industry while its review committee is headed by a person of Professor Garnaut's distinction. </PARA>

An application for a visitors visa was lodged by Ms Narsaiya, who was looking forward to spending Christmas in Australia on 22 December 1992. She was interviewed on 24 December 1992 by an embassy official. The embassy was not, however, satisfied that Ms Narsaiya would abide by the conditions relating to the visitor's visa and so refused to grant a visitor's visa to her. Reasons for this refusal were given to Ms Narsaiya, as they should be, and it is with these reasons that I take particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason given by the embassy was that Ms Narsaiya's financial and employment position was not sufficient for a person undertaking international travel, because her personal financial position and assets were limited. While I consider such discrimination on the basis of wealth distasteful, I acknowledge that there may be a need for such a standard in some circumstances. One might observe, however, the number of backpackers and younger tourists that Australia rightly welcomes for extended stays in this country. It would be a rare young person amongst this group of tourists, most of whom are either at university or have just finished their studies, who would command assets or income of any substance. Yet we do not deny visitors' visas to them on this basis. It clearly would be wrong if we did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immediately, the question arises: why is this criterion sufficient to bar Ms Narsaiya from visiting Australia, but not to bar others in analogous situations?  However, even if it is accepted that this criterion is generally applicable in a case such as Ms Narsaiya's, it would fail on the particular facts of this matter. The MacLaren family, the sponsors of Ms Narsaiya's visit, were prepared to provide the full cost of the trip and guarantee Ms Narsaiya's flight home. In other words, the MacLaren family expressly stated that they were prepared to take responsibility for her expenses. The MacLarens even went to the extent of offering to give these undertakings in writing, if necessary, and did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lack of financial resources should only be a relevant matter for consideration in the granting of a visitor's visa if it is reasonably conceivable that this relative impecuniosity could create a problem. So far as Ms Narsaiya was concerned, there could be no fear of such a problem arising, because of the guarantee offered by the MacLarens. The inescapable conclusion is that the criterion of financial and employment status of the applicant was incorrectly applied here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the second reason. Despite the prima facie appearance of an incorrect application of a general guideline in the first reason for refusal, my most serious misgivings about this decision arise from the second reason given. One could say that this second reason was an omnibus reason, in that several grounds for refusal appeared to be consolidated within the one reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reason, the embassy stated that the applicant had little incentive to return to Fiji, that it was highly unusual for a woman in Ms Narsaiya's position to stay at the home of a bachelor like Mr MacLaren and that the nature of the relationship between Ms Narsaiya and Mr MacLaren had not been fully articulated, to use the words of the embassy official. The speculation and supposition in these statements, which virtually amount to allegations, is manifest. But each one of these statements is so injurious and hurtful to all the parties involved that each statement deserves a response and an answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that Ms Narsaiya had no reason to return to Fiji is to imagine her life there as irredeemably hopeless and Australia as a promised land. Now, I do not doubt that Australia would appear that way with some justification to many people around the world. The point is that neither of these suppositions is true in the case of Ms Narsaiya. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, Ms Narsaiya has a close and loving family in Fiji, with whom she lives and which she would no doubt find it very difficult to leave. Secondly, she has a stable job in Fiji as a supervisor in a clothing factory. Indeed, Ms Narsaiya is valued highly enough by her employer for him to promise to grant her leave of absence from her job should she go to Australia. I am informed that assurances to this end were put in writing by her employer and given to the embassy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot find stronger attachments to a place than those of family and work. Both of these attachments are very strong for Ms Narsaiya. If it is true that there would be no reason for her to return to Fiji if she visited Australia, then there is no reason for any of us to stay where we choose to be. The demonstrable falsity of this demonstrates the unsustainability of this finding by the embassy. Secondly, the pejorative insinuations in the remarks about the normality of the planned visit and the relationship between Ms Narsaiya and Mr MacLaren are, frankly, insulting and improper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To claim, as the embassy unfortunately did, that Ms Narsaiya would be living in the home of an unmarried man is only half correct. The embassy failed in its reasoning to admit that the applicant would also be living with his parents. To impute automatically something more than a mere friendship if a woman chooses to stay under the same roof as a man is simply ridiculous in this day and age. Are we to believe that the embassy official responsible for this decision truly believes that the fact of members of the opposite sex sleeping under the same roof creates a non-rebuttable presumption of a sexual relationship? Is a course of mid-Victorian English novels compulsory for Australian Embassy officials so that they develop such a peculiarly sensitive source of morality?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, to state that the relationship was not fully articulated is incorrect. The relationship is quite clear in the particular circumstances&mdash;it was and is nothing more than a friendship. Friendships between members of the opposite sex are hardly so rare as to lead automatically to the conclusion that something suspicious is afoot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire second reason given by the embassy cannot be characterised as anything except specious, with an appearance of plausibility but in essence false. Both the MacLaren family and Ms Narsaiya value, above all else, their honesty. If there were something more to this relationship than friendship, it would be admitted. What the MacLarens find most aggrieving about this affair is the not so subtle inference that they are engaging in a shabby subterfuge. Their honesty has been impugned and they are justifiably angry about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the genuine nature of the visit; the embassy also stated there was doubt over the genuine nature of Ms Narsaiya's visit to Australia. It is unfortunate that the embassy considered the mere assertion of this doubt sufficient and failed to give any substance to that doubt. Indeed, the unsatisfactory nature of this conclusion by the embassy is implicit in its brevity. It is my belief that the purpose of the visit was totally genuine. I will go so far as to say that if this visit were not genuine, then none are. I went so far as to give a character reference about the MacLaren family to officials in Fiji. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now go to the matter of whether the six grounds for the grant of a visa were satisfied. In the letter refusing the grant of visa to Ms Narsaiya on 24 December 1992, the senior migration officer of the Australian Embassy in Fiji stated that there were six prescribed requirements for such a grant, in addition to the general finding that the visit was genuine. These six grounds are health, character, settlement, controversiality, debts to the Commonwealth or past exclusions from readmission to Australia. It is plain that these six grounds were, in truth, met in every case. I note that controversy is a ground for exclusion. It seems to me that the only controversial aspect of this case is the refusal to grant a visa for no good reason by the embassy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MacLarens have told me that they take the embassy's refusal as a personal affront to their integrity. Certainly, it is easy to see it in this way. Not unreasonably, the MacLarens would like the Australian Embassy to justify its reasons for doubting their good faith. I cannot imagine, and nor can they, what else they could do or offer to do to prove the genuine nature of the application. Another salient point must be the fact that the embassy chose to ignore the support offered to the application by three Federal parliamentarians&mdash;the former member for Bass, Mr Warwick Smith, the Hon. Senator Michael Tate and me&mdash;and the attestations as to MacLarens' bona fides by these three Federal parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the criteria for the grant of a visitor's visa were applied in every case in the same way that they were applied in Ms Narsaiya's case, no-one would ever get into this country. For this reason, the motivations behind the denial of the visitor's visa must be accepted as questionable. This decision is redolent of racism and has the appearance of a Minister for immigration being unable or unwilling to control or scrutinise the action of his officers. It is indisputable that there is much more to this decision than is simply apparent&mdash;this is clear from the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As thrifty, hardworking, honest and earnest Australians, the MacLarens are entitled to know what the true explanation is of this decision. Ms Narsaiya is also entitled to an explanation. There have been ample opportunities for the department to do so. Government and its officers must be accountable, if nothing else. An explanation of the refusal to grant a visitor's visa is demanded. I believe it must be received and it must be delivered. I ask for the support of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) in this particular matter, as a fellow Tasmanian. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of the question was about the value of Australian sugar exports to the United States. Over the last 10 to 12 years there has been a significant reduction in the amount of sugar we have exported to the United States because of market closing procedures in the US. The Australian sugar exports to the United States in Australian dollar value terms were estimated at around $55 million last year. Overall, we have less than two per cent of the US sugar market. We are the fourth largest supplier to the US.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second part of the question, on 11 May at 7.20 p.m. Washington time, the US Department of Agriculture released a press statement headed `The US Department of Agriculture extends tariff rate quota for sugar'. In that it said that the US tariff rate quota for 1992-93 would apply in 1993-94, it would increase the quota level and that the US trade representative would shortly announce country by country quotas. That sounds like good news but in reality it means that, by averaging the tariff rate quota over two years, for the year 1993-94 there will be a reduction in the quota.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the global reduction is specified, the US trade representative will shortly announce what the country by country effect will be. If the normal calculations are applied in Australia's case, we would expect that to be a reduction of 10,000 metric tonnes for the year 1993-94. I emphasise that the usual way of calculating our share of the global quota would see a reduction of 10,000 metric tonnes, coming down from 96,786 metric tonnes to, by the usual calculation, 86,070 metric tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This circumstance would be a significant blow to the Australian sugar industry. It would also be a further closing of access to the US market. In the current world trade situation, that is not something to be wished or supported.</PARA>

I refer the Minister to today's unemployment figures, which nobody in the Opposition has mentioned yet, which show the number of long-term unemployed in Australia has actually increased by 0.5 per cent. Why is the Government giving those Australians like us lucky enough to be in work an $8 billion tax cut, which the country cannot afford, while leaving thousands of Australians on the long-term unemployed permanent scrap heap? If the Government can afford, as it keeps asserting, this $8 billion, how many long-term unemployed could be assisted back into the work force if that $8 billion were targeted to programs for those people?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue, which Senator Childs has raised, is very important. Halon gas has been widely used in Australia in fire suppression systems. Although it has been very effective in that regard, more recent concerns about the ozone layer have drawn to people's attention the serious concern that halons are extremely aggressive in ozone depletion. My scientific knowledge about halon gas is not the world's most profound but my understanding is that it is the same process which makes it effective in fire suppression that also makes it dangerous to the ozone in terms of its impact on oxygen. However, I am reliably advised that in normal usage halon is not harmful to people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Childs has said, Australia is a signatory to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. To meet our obligations under that protocol, and to act as a responsible international citizen, we have decided to withdraw halon from use by the end of 1995. It is estimated that there are about 5,000 tonnes of halon in current use in Australia&mdash;70 per cent is held by the Commonwealth and State governments, 15 per cent by major corporations and 15 per cent by small business and the community. The Prime Minister announced previously that we would be setting up a halon bank on a commercial basis through the DAS centre for environmental management. The funding for that, as Senator Parer would know, is in the supplementary estimates which we discussed the other night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major users&mdash;that is, the Commonwealth and State governments, and the major corporations&mdash;will be expected to meet the costs of collection, storage and destruction.

It seems appropriate that we should not make those people bear the cost of what is a decision in the national interest rather than in the interest of any particular individual. So there will be a $4.6 million subsidy for that. Activity on the halon bank is proceeding now and it will get under way apace with the passage of the supplementary estimates and the money becoming available to fund the small holders.</PARA>

Cargo throughput is close to peak levels of 1989-90 when major ports experienced serious congestion and delays in cargo handling with more than double the current work force. Stevedoring contract rates have fallen by 20 to 30 per cent, and that has been generated by the intense competition as a result of the reform.

What has the Government done to respond to the suggestions made by various people and groups about how Australia's wool stockpile could be reduced?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Fortunately, I happen to have an answer briefed for me by the Minister who represents this portfolio, Simon Crean. The import of this question is that we should become a nation of knitters. In the wake of the collapse of the reserve price scheme, the Wool Realisation Commission was established to sell the stockpile and discharge the industry debt. In recognition of the current circumstances facing the industry, on 28 April the Government announced a package of measures to assist the wool industry. These measures included:  additional structural adjustment assistance; maintaining the wool tax at its current level; relieving the Wool Realisation Commission of the need to sell wool into a weak market, thus avoiding further downward pressures on price; together with the previous removal of the fixed repayment requirements and freeing up the period of sale for non-wool assets. The Government has therefore maximised the commercial flexibility of the Wool Realisation Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. I refer to today's announcement from the US that next year's sugar quotas will be cut, which will be a loss to Australia of some 10,000 to 11,000 tonnes, as the Minister has said, and a $3 million cut to the farmers. This amounts to a 90 per cent cut in Australia's quota over the last 10 years. I ask the Minister: how do these latest US quota cuts square with President Clinton's rhetoric on free trade and reduced protection?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a considerable difference. Thank you very much, Senator Crane, for helping me. Before the introduction of sugar quotas in the United States in 1982, Australia's exports of sugar to the US totalled 811,000 tonnes. As I said in an earlier answer today, if the new global limits are computed in the normal way in which we would expect them to be computed, the quota for Australia for the year 1993-94 would be down around 86,000 tonnes. In fact, as Senator Boswell says in his question, it is almost a 90 per cent reduction. Back in 1982 we had a 17 per cent share of the US import market. We now have an 8.3 per cent share of the US import market and a two per cent share of the sugar market in the US overall. So that is a dramatic reduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell asks in his question what weight we should put on President Clinton's remarks about the completion of the Uruguay Round. The Government's view is that the best way of opening up the sugar market in the United States, and for that matter all the other markets in rural products, particularly beef, is to pursue the Uruguay Round settlement to the full this year. In order to ensure that we deliver as much weight behind the need for a full settlement this year, I have convened a Cairns Group meeting of free trading nations to be held in Thailand in June of this year prior to the meeting of the G7 so that the agricultural nations of the world can put as much effort behind their overtures to the G7 to conclude the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to see that multilateral trade negotiation round conclude in a strong way on the draft final act proposals, the Dunkel text, as amended by the Blair House accord which is the agricultural settlement. That is the best way of proceeding. President Clinton has made a number of remarks recently that that is his wish too, and certainly the observation Senator Boswell has made in his question is pertinent, that in the case of sugar that does not seem to be consistent. We believe that the best way of resolving this overall is through the Uruguay Round, but we will be making the representations I referred to in my earlier answer directly on a bilateral basis to try to turn around what appears to be a very damaging decision for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Alston on 13 May 1993 relating to the tendering process for subscription television licences.</PARA>
<PARA>Apart from Senator Collins having committed what I would have thought was an egregious offence in not only treating this chamber with contempt but also refusing to answer a question which was so simple that it merely asked whether a document exists, I submit that he has been guilty of a much more serious offence. Yesterday, when being asked a question by Senator O'Chee about advice that had been received and on what basis he had given a direction to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, Senator Collins conceded that he had had oral advice from his departmental officers. It was put to him that the only written advice he had had was from John Doherty, a senior legal adviser in the department, and that that was to the contrary. Senator Collins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did receive advice that I had power . . . If I had not been told that that was lawful, I would never have made it.</PARA>
<PARA>He declined to elaborate on whether the advice was oral or written on the grounds that the matter was sub judice. We know that the notion of sub judice has absolutely nothing to do with this particular situation because that, of course, is a question that goes to the merits of a case before either a jury or a magistrate. It clearly has no relevance to the situation of a judge sitting alone who has already reserved his decision. In any event, it is beside the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The much more serious proposition is that, following that statement to the Senate that he had received advice, which he declined to identify, Senator Collins has gone on today to identify that advice. He identified it by tabling during an answer a copy of the advice he received from Roger Beale, a senior departmental official, which accompanied the draft notification to the ABA. As I understand it, what Senator Collins relies upon in support of the proposition that he had written advice in favour of his action is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under section 161 of the Broadcasting Services Act, you have express power to notify the ABA of general policies of the Government that are to apply to the ABA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again Senator Collins is treating the Senate with contempt, pretending that somehow some extra-parliamentary committee appointed to suit his own convenience, to sheet home blame to everyone but himself, has standing ahead of this chamber. We all know that it has not. The written advice&mdash;Senator Collins conceded this in the Federal Court, as I understand it&mdash;says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any policy or direction issued by the Minister must not be inconsistent with the scope and objects of the Broadcasting Services Act. The ABA is at law required to act in accordance with the legislation as it stands. It is questionable whether the ABA could take into account, or be directed to take into account, a proposed change to the legislation. The ABA does not seem to have a legitimate basis to adopt the approach of rejecting all applications put before it for subscription television broadcasting licences via MDS. A direction not to grant MDS licences for subscription television broadcasting services seems to cut across the objectives of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that was all very clear, especially to someone who fancies himself as having an understanding of the basic principles of administrative law. The proposition is that one reads power provided in an Act within the context of that Act. It does not mean that one is at large. If it says that one has power to give directions, one can give directions only within the objectives of the Act. That is precisely what the written advice was about. The written advice raised very serious doubts about whether Senator Collins had any such legal power, and he well understands this. In his own words, he is not a mug, whatever else he might be, and he ought to understand&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So he concedes that he is a mug. I apologise; I had not meant to embarrass Senator Collins in that way. It ought to be abundantly clear that the point at issue is whether that express power was indeed within the terms of the Act. If it is not, of course, it is ultra vires. That was a very important legal question on which Senator Collins had precise legal advice. And all the written advice raised all sorts of doubts about it. Apart from being couched in diplomatic language, I would have thought that any sensible person reading that would have said that it was a no-no. It was clearly telling Senator Collins, in effect, that it was contrary to the Act and that he could not do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, what Senator Collins had was legal advice saying that he was not able to give the directions he did. Yet he stands up here and tells the Senate that he had advice supporting his actions. If that is the best Senator Collins can do, I invite him to indicate whether there was any express legal advice other than that of Mr Doherty's; whether in fact he kept notes of any discussions he had by telephone with any of his legal advisers; or whether what he really did was ignore written advice that this was ultra vires, simply pretend that he talked a number of advisers into a certain position, and then go ahead and do precisely what he wanted to do in the first place, irrespective of any advice to the contrary. </PARA>

In my view, there would have been real problems if some of the options that had been addressed and to which advice had been directed had been adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston should have a look, if he wants to, at the records in the Federal Court that have been made available to journalists and were being discussed&mdash;and I talked about it this morning: options such as directing the ABA to restrict MDS to narrowcasting only, which is a course I did not adopt and on which I got advice that that would probably almost certainly require legislation. The cold hard facts are&mdash;and Senator Alston is not interested in the cold hard facts&mdash;that there were options being canvassed that were not subsequently adopted that may have given rise to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy&mdash;indeed, I have no choice in the matter&mdash;to have those matters judged by the Federal Court because they will be judged by the Federal Court.

Have a look at the submission. The press has it. Have a look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three issues principally before the Federal Court. One and two relate to that definition Senator Alston referred to of whether the advice or the direction was within power. That is a legal matter for the court to determine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue before the Federal Court&mdash;and I canvassed it this morning&mdash;is my role in it, and that is that I took the direction knowing it was unlawful. That is not an abstract legal issue; it has been tested before the Federal Court. The applicant's submission to the Federal Court&mdash;and I am the subject of it&mdash;goes to considerable lengths to make that point. So this very point Senator Alston makes is being judged in there now. I absolutely do not resile&mdash;despite the outrageous interpretation that Senator Alston has made on sub judice&mdash;from saying that it would be outrageously improper, or certainly unwise, for a member of parliament, who is the subject of the court action concerned, to canvass those issues before the judgment has been brought down. I do not resile from saying that. One would have to be a very irresponsible person, in my view, to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying to the Senate on that issue&mdash;not on the first two issues: that is, as to whether the section 160 and 161 matters were properly dealt with&mdash;is that the court will determine that. At the appropriate time the court will bring down a judgment as to whether or not the legal advice that I received was correct. I point out that the people whom I was consulting&mdash;in concert with the senior officers of my department, of course&mdash;are the people who gave the directions to the draftsmen to put that Act together. </PARA>

But there was no difficulty in tabling the short answers or putting them into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, and the transcript from the court shows it.

I read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;what more can I do?&mdash;the short answers that were given to those questions.

<PARA>However, it does not say that the Minister has a power to give an instruction to the ABA to do something that is contrary to the purposes of the legislation. The ABA, in putting into effect the policy of the Government, can only do what it is permitted to do within the scope of the legislation; in other words, the legislation states the limit of the power of the ABA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within that limit of power the Minister then has the opportunity to give particular instructions.

As we have indicated previously, there is considerable evidence that it would interfere with a very important recreational facility which is now being exploited by the tourist industry very effectively.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) bus services be introduced into Gungahlin as soon as the first neighbourhoods are occupied;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) intertown express services be introduced between Gungahlin and Belconnen, and Gungahlin and Civic as soon as demand exists;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) a conveniently located bus interchange be established in Gungahlin at the first opportunity; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) a detailed strategy of measures to encourage the use of public transport and other non-car modes of transport, such as those described in paragraph 3.4, be developed and implemented as soon as Gungahlin's first neighbourhoods are occupied.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>COMMENT</PARA>
<PARA>While these matters are the responsibility of the ACT Government, the extent to which non-car modes of transport including buses are utilised would be expected to have a significant effect on the scale of the need for the development of road links to Gungahlin.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the NCPA and the ACT Planning Authority jointly commission or conduct a study into the establishment of a rapid transport system in the Australian Capital Territory.This study should consider the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the most appropriate type of rapid transport technology;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) the extent of such a transport system, for example whether it should link Gungahlin to Civic alone or be part of a wider network;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) a timetable for the construction of such a system including the possible early establishment of the system in already settled areas of Canberra;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) the construction and operational costs of such a system;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion that has just been moved by Senator Robert Ray. Firstly, in some ways it is disappointing that it has taken so long to receive a response to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gungahlin's Transport Links</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in May 1991. The Minister will be surprised, if he goes to the area, to find how Gungahlin has grown and become inhabited in the meantime. So the matter of transport links from Gungahlin to the older parts of Canberra has been, and remains, important. Particularly important are the links between Gungahlin and the Civic area. This issue came up again in an inquiry we held but have not yet reported on relating to construction on Vernon Circle around City Hill. Hopefully, that report will be able to be tabled in the Parliament once the Joint Committee on the National Capital has been re-established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation No. 3 of the report we refer to limiting the number of vehicles travelling between Gungahlin and Civic or other southern destinations. I refer to that issue particularly because it did come up again&mdash;I think I was one of the members of the committee who raised it&mdash;when we looked at the matter of the type of construction that could reasonably be placed around Vernon Circle and City Hill. We were being asked to approve developments in that area while the answers to the questions about Gungahlin traffic getting to Civic and southern destinations have yet to be resolved. I mention it again here merely because it is still not resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most outstanding thing about the Government's response to the report is the way that it highlights the linking between the responsibilities of the National Capital Planning Authority&mdash;that is, the Federal Government&mdash;and of the ACT Government in certain areas of Canberra. The extent to which this is referred to in the Government's response is accurate, and I am not challenging it. I merely refer to it in order to highlight the very great necessity to see that these two government bodies work most closely together. If they do not, the loser will surely be the national capital. We will never be able to encourage business to come here and people to invest here if these two planning authorities function in such a way as to make it too complicated and too costly to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am speaking about this issue this afternoon in order to highlight the necessity for the national capital plan and its influence on the territory to blend into and work well with the ACT plan. This envisages the two governments recognising their responsibilities not just to their own plans but to the people of Canberra in making sure that the plan works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the document there are comments such as, `This is an ACT Government responsibility'. However, the Commonwealth Government would need to consider the implications for the national capital plan of any proposed work. That is correct, but it must also recognise the time it can take to work out things like that when anybody comes along with an idea that they wish to proceed with in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to speak only to recommendation No. 3 and recommendation No. 10 of the committee today. Recommendation No. 10 of the committee states:</PARA>

<PARA>that is, the National Capital Planning Authority&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and ACT Planning Authority study of the area south of Mitchell and between the Federal and Barton Highways commence immediately . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to item (b). The response is that this recommendation is supported. The response then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national capital plan has identified the need for this study.</PARA>
<PARA>This recommendation was made to this Parliament in May 1991. I would have hoped that much more had been done than appears to be implied in the Government's response. If the matter has gone no further than what is being said to the Senate today, I believe it is high time that it is given some priority. Because more houses are being occupied in Gungahlin every day, the links to the city are very important for those who will be affected by them&mdash;certainly those in the northern suburbs of Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have referred to the other areas of Monash Drive and the links around the other side of Canberra. Those links are important whether John Dedman East road proceeds or not. It was our view that it should not. I say to both the Federal and ACT governments, through their planning authorities, that some of these matters need to proceed with slightly more haste than appears to be the case from the way that this response has been worded. I seek leave to continue my remarks later because I am not certain whether Senator Macdonald wishes to speak. He may wish to do so on another occasion. </PARA>

I have pleasure in presenting this brief report by a delegation of the Australian Parliament to the republic of Fiji last October. The report, which was agreed to last December, has been delayed due to the pressure of parliamentary business last year and the election this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Fiji, led by Stephen Martin in his then role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, accompanied by Peter Fisher, the former National Party member for Mallee, Phil Bergin, the then Sergeant-at-Arms, Jack Heath, from Stephen Martin's staff, and myself was very short, spanning only four days, although in the three days prior to the visit we had also participated as delegates and observers in the South Pacific conference. However, although the visit was short, it was important in that it was the first official visit of a parliamentary delegation to the new Parliament, and represented another stage in the normalisation of relations between Fiji and Australia following the coups some years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report summarises the four days the delegation spent in Fiji. The delegation met with the Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, the Deputy Prime Minister, Filipe Bole, and the presiding officers of the Parliament and the leaders of the Opposition parties, Mr Jai Ram Reddy of the National Federation Party and Mahendra Chaudrey of the Fijian Labour Party. We were also able to have discussions with a number of business people, Fijian and Australians, who are running businesses in Fiji, both in the capital, Suva, and the industrial city of Ba on the north-west coast of the island of Viti Levu. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During these visits we learned of some of the difficulties experienced in Australian-Fijian business relations. There are difficulties with the South Pacific regional trade agreement&mdash;or SPARTECA, as it is known&mdash;and particularly with the rules of origin of that treaty. There are difficulties in developing standards. I believe that this is an area where direct and specific aid could be given by Australia which would be very useful to Fiji. There are also difficulties for Fijian business people in obtaining visas when making short business visits to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On our return these problems were conveyed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). Important questions of racial tension, and constitutional reform flowing from that, were raised by the delegation. We were pleased to receive an assurance from the Prime Minister of Fiji that he would make a statement to the Parliament on the timetable for the review of the constitution during the next session of Parliament. I note that this statement has since been made and that there does appear to be a genuine desire to tackle some of the difficult representational and constitutional problems which have been the cause of Fiji's recent difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the Presiding Officers of the Parliament of Fiji on behalf of the delegation for arranging a comprehensive and interesting program for our short visit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In Pakistan I was privileged to be able to visit a women's prison. We received cooperation to be able to go to many other places of interest and gain insight into what was happening there. One of the highlights of the visit for me was the opportunity to meet with Madam Benazir Bhutto. As people may be aware, there was some unrest and, since that time, there has been further disturbance in Pakistan politically, with elections scheduled for 14 July. As I mentioned before, I want to thank the staff of the High Commission and the parliamentary officials who assisted us very ably in showing us the country and the operations of their parliaments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in relation to the parliamentary delegation to Malaysia, which occurred on 24 June to 2 July, the delegation leader was Mr Laurie Brereton, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. It was a very important time for establishing better relationships between Australia and Malaysia. On several occasions mention was made that at that time there had been no parliamentary visits from Malaysia to Australia for four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the delegation were very happy that, following our invitation for a parliamentary delegation to visit Australia, the invitation was taken up and the Malaysian delegation visited Australia from 13 to 20 September 1992. One regret was that we did not see more of Malaysia. We felt that the next Australian delegation should include the eastern side of the Malaysian peninsula and Sabah and/or Sarawak in its schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's relationship with Malaysia is one of its strongest in the Asian region. Defence and educational ties continue to be the core elements of the diverse and substantial partnership between the two countries. The delegation was repeatedly assured that these were not affected by the periodic strains in bilateral relations experienced during recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other elements of the Australia-Malaysia relationship include trade and investment, tourism, control of narcotics and refugee resettlement. It was noted, too, that Penang and Adelaide have a sister city arrangement. There was some mention of the media irritants which had been working against the relationship between the two countries, but it was expressed that these were seen to be isolated incidents and problems were being overcome with the greater level of interaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sign of the positive state of relations between Australia and Malaysia was the high level of appointments afforded to the delegation. In addition to meeting with the President of the Senate, there were meetings with the Ministers for foreign affairs, defence, justice and finance. The foreign affairs Minister of Malaysia suggested that relations could be further enhanced if parliamentarians from both countries sought to make contact with each other at meetings of the Inter-Parliamentary Union and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and on other similar occasions. The delegation considers this a very worthwhile suggestion and members would urge their parliamentary colleagues to avail themselves of any such opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this point to note that we have actually received an invitation to the East Asia and Pacific Parliamentarians' Conference on Environment and Development, which will be held from 7 to 8 June in Seoul, from Mr Park Jun Byung, President of the Korean National Assembly's Korean Parliamentary League. I should have referred to this when I was speaking on the Korean delegation, but it is also an example of the point that the Malaysian foreign Minister made. It represents the kind of cooperation that all countries welcomed. An Aboriginal art exhibition was a highlight of the Malaysian visit and we congratulate all those who were associated with the preparation and presentation of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our stay I visited the prison in which Michael McAuliffe, an Australian citizen who is currently facing the death penalty in Malaysia, is being held. We were able to point out that both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) have appealed for clemency for Mr McAuliffe, and the delegation made a similar appeal. I was grateful to be allowed the visit with Mr McAuliffe and gave him an assurance of Australia's concern regarding his well being and of our continuing interest in his situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McAuliffe has been in custody for seven years and is pleased to be undergoing a process of review by the Penang pardons board, because it enables him to be in a better situation within the prison. He is therefore in no rush for those pardon proceedings to conclude. While we may wish that he be granted clemency and are concerned that a citizen is facing the death penalty, which is not legal in our country, it may not necessarily be in his interests to try to speed up that process of appeal. I therefore simply express our renewed concern that one of our citizens is facing that penalty in a strange land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks by urging honourable senators to read the report. It was a very satisfactory experience. I gratefully acknowledge all those people in Malaysia who assisted with the organisation and conduct of that successful visit, whose names have been listed earlier. In particular, I make note of the staff of the Malaysian Parliament and the Australian High Commissioner, His Excellency Mr Frank Murray, and his staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge the efforts of those people in Australia who assisted with the organisation of all three visits and provided briefing materials and oral briefings and staff of the Department of the Parliamentary Library; officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; members of the Parliamentary Relations Office; and employees of Qantas. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the national report on schooling is to inform the Australian people of the education that was provided during 1991 to over three million students in 10,000 schools across the eight States and Territories of Australia. The report is an excellent document which contains valuable information relating to the various school systems in Australia. It is the issue of the devolution of powers and responsibilities from State bureaucracies to the individual schools, outlined in this report, which I particularly wish to address today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I specifically wish to focus upon the example of the excellent education system in my home State of New South Wales, presided over by the Hon. Virginia Chadwick MLC. The New South Wales government school system adopted nine priorities in 1991, and these priorities formed the basis for planning at all levels. The first of these priorities was to implement the main strategies and recommendations of the Scott report to ensure that schools, not the central bureaucracy, are the focus of educational services. Additionally, the New South Wales system sought to promote and recognise excellence and choice. Therefore, I believe that New South Wales stands as an example for the other States to follow. The current Director-General of Education in New South Wales, Dr Ken Boston, came from South Australia to New South Wales because he was attracted by the exciting educational reform program in our State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales coalition Government has various initiatives relating to the goals of promoting and recognising excellence. Among these are basic skill testing; assessment and reporting of student progress; dezoning of schools; and the creation of selective high schools, senior high schools, technology high schools and centres of excellence within many other high schools. As a result of these initiatives, parents have a greater opportunity to fulfil their aspirations for their family by sending their children to schools which much better match their children's needs. Indeed, next year we are planning to move my youngest daughter, Marguerite, from a private school to the State Broadmeadow High School for the Performing Arts because we believe the curriculum at that school best meets her needs and aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have told this story to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that parents have great concern about the quality of their children's education and are effective monitors of children's progress if provided with the opportunity to do so. All the research shows that if parents and teachers work in a cooperative relationship, educational outcomes are greatly improved. That is why the New South Wales education system includes in its nine policy principles the need to encourage the involvement of parents in the community more closely in school decision making. Australia's best education system, that of New South Wales, states as a goal the need to provide curriculum and educational experience relevant to the long-term needs of students and the community. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend this report to the Senate, as it provides the opportunity for those from other States and anyone else interested in education to review the excellent policies being implemented in New South Wales, and hopefully adopt them for their own State education systems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I congratulate you on occupying, I think for the first time, the important seat in which you are now sitting. When I spoke before on this report I made some general comments. I congratulated ATSIC for much of the good work it had performed, whilst indicating that there is always room for improvement in the way it operates&mdash;the same as there is always room for improvement in the way we all operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When my time expired, I was raising a note of warning to the Government and the commission. It related to a vote in the electorate of Herbert, based in Townsville, where an independent candidate, who ran on what I think most people would loosely describe as an anti-Aboriginal, anti-migrant, anti-welfare campaign, received some 14 per cent of the vote. That is a very substantial figure for an independent candidate and I might add that he polled third after the candidates for the Labor and Liberal parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The warning I give to the Government and to ATSIC is that they really must explain very carefully the way they effect their programs for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. There is a perception, which is reflected in that vote in the electorate of Herbert, that a lot of the money that is spent is wrongly spent. It has brought about a considerable hardening of attitude amongst many Australians who believe that they are being unfairly treated by comparison with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. It is a very complex question. I am not for a moment saying that I agree with or support that proposal; I am simply warning that there is that feeling around. It behoves the Government and ATSIC to more clearly define their programs and outline where the money is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that 100 per cent of Australians would support the spending of money on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and any disadvantaged group in the areas of health, education and housing&mdash;I do not think anyone would argue about that&mdash;but there are many programs which people perceive as not being in the best interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and as really becoming an absolute waste of money and a wrong direction for the spending of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real problem with alcoholism in Aboriginal communities. That problem is a very debilitating one for the Aboriginal and, to a lesser extent, Torres Strait Islander races and it really needs to be addressed by the Government. But there is an enormous number of other programs which people cannot understand the benefit of and which I do think the Government and ATSIC should look at very carefully to ensure that money is not being wrongly directed in those areas and that all Australians are seen to be receiving a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to elaborate any more on that except to raise the warning, and I do hope that the Government and ATSIC will become aware of it. I am sure they will also be analysing the vote of that particular candidate. I hope they will adopt strategies which will make all Australians understand the need for proper assistance for Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander and all other disadvantaged people. </PARA>

There are very great concerns at Gurulmundi, outside Miles, where a waste dump is going in, in the face of very strong opposition from a section of the community. There is also in the Brisbane valley around Esk a very great concern that a radioactive waste depository may be established there shortly.

There is a lot of scientific evidence one way and another in the case of the Gurulmundi site and, whilst governments have to make decisions on the balance of reports, there are some very concerning scientific reports on the effect that the siting of that dump at Gurulmundi may have on the environment and amenity of the surrounding area. That does not relate directly to this report but it is, of course, indirectly related. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at this report, I simply note that permits were granted for the export of hazardous wastes for the periods August 1991 to February 1992, February 1992 to August 1992, and so on&mdash;for a considerable period of time. Those permits were for exporting wastes principally to the United Kingdom&mdash;Ellesmere Port, Fawley and Pontypool. Apparently, on 5 May the Basel convention came into force and because the United Kingdom was not yet a party to it, under article 4.5 of the convention Australia was unable to export hazardous waste beyond 5 May 1992 to the United Kingdom for destruction. Permits that had been issued beyond that date were varied to suspend export of waste to the United Kingdom on 5 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder&mdash;the report does not say and possibly someone from the Government might be able to indicate to me&mdash;what happened to all the hazardous waste that was intended to be exported and for which permits had been granted and which are now no longer available.

It is an interesting question and I would hope that someone in the Government might at some time be able to provide me with an answer to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the 1991-92 annual report for the Australian National Maritime Museum&mdash;an annual report which is very late. I speak with some regret, as a great fan of the national maritime museum and as a foundation member of it; but that emotional support for the museum does not prevent me from complaining about the fact that this report is excessively late. The audit office only signed its report on 15 March 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that when an auditor's report is so late&mdash;nine months after the completion of the financial year, and well beyond the guidelines for government instrumentalities&mdash;there should be a reason included in the report for the delay. There is no such reason and I think there ought to be. I do not know whether the audit office plans to include in its latest publications a statement about why this audit took so long, but there certainly should be some statement somewhere about why it took so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the draft report, apart from the Auditor-General's report, was ready a long time ago. One cannot blame anyone else in the chamber, by the look of things, because that report was conveyed reasonably speedily to this Parliament on the resumption of sittings after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do note one thing in the audit report: the museum has not applied the recoverable amount test for valuation of non-current assets, and the auditor agrees with that. There is no doubt that it is impossible, basically, to value a museum's collection. For that reason, I think it only sensible that the auditor has gone away from the normal structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other points I want to make. The report, in a financial sense, is disappointing&mdash;apart from the late auditing&mdash;in that admissions have nowhere near approached the attendance figures that had been hoped for. As a result, revenues are substantially down on what had been hoped for. As the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Museum is a popular venue for overseas dignitaries and international tourists. Over 200,000 visitors have paid to inspect the Museum&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in the year to last June. The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, entry takings have fallen short of projections, as the imposition of entry charges by Sydney museums which were traditionally free has encountered public resistance, the recession has discouraged discretionary spending, while new entrants have increased the competition for the cultural and leisure dollar. In this market, a bigger advertising budget is essential to compete for visitors with State and private attractions.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, this situation has continued into the current financial year, as the Advance to the Minister for Finance has shown in recent times and as became evident in the Senate estimates committee process when additional appropriation was required to pay the bills. This raises an interesting question because, as this report points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Development of new programs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>at the museum&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">particularly exhibitions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and, by the way, the way to attract people is to have new exhibitions and develop new programs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is hampered by lack of discretionary funding. For instance, 35% of the Government Appropriation disappeared on renting premises, including $3.4 million for the Museum building at Darling Harbour. Rent will be even higher in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA>In a sense, a great proportion of the Government's allocation of around $11 million last year went to pay itself rent. So the capacity for this outstanding museum to really increase its activities sufficiently to attract lots of people to it, particularly by way of publicity, promotion and advertising, is regrettably limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The museum depends heavily on volunteers to provide support for it. If those volunteers were not there, the shortfall would be even larger and the pressure on the public purse even greater. I certainly want to commend those volunteers for all the work they do along with, of course, the very dedicated staff and board of the museum. But I do ask that they get their annual report out a lot quicker next year, and I hope we will see evidence of a clear program, some kind of pattern, to ensure that the museum is adequately funded.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, may I add my congratulations to the elevation of your good self to the position of Acting Deputy President. Certainly those of us on our side look forward to your deliberations and rulings with some interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I address my remarks this afternoon to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Competency Based Approaches to University Selection and Credit Transfer</EMPHASIS>, the advice from NBEET. In so doing, I note that a couple of days ago the Government tabled 10 NBEET reports all in one go. I was very concerned about that tabling in one hit, given that some of those advices were extremely important. This particular advice, for example, is a major issue doing the rounds at universities. Certainly in relation to the Government's training agenda, it is vitally important that we get this right. That the Government can simply table this advice along with nine others, in my view, makes a mockery of the scrutiny element involved in the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely difficult for us to read all these advices, take in their content and make sensible comment about them when 10 are tabled in one go and we have only five minutes to address the very important questions that are involved. This issue of competency-based training is one of them. I signal here that the Democrats will be raising this issue at the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, and this whole question of how we can more effectively scrutinise education policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been my experience over the last 18 months that this Parliament has very little opportunity to examine and comment on in detail education policy as developed by this Labor Government. I believe that is a very serious development because it means that policy and actions are developed by bureaucrats and sanctioned by Ministers, and we are left to simply examine the crumbs and really do not have much opportunity for input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government needs to remember that there are those of us on the other side who do have some experience and expertise, having come from the area, and would certainly be very keen to ensure that the Government's programs receive more scrutiny. It seems to me that NBEET, the body whose 10 reports we are examining this afternoon, has an enormously important role in formulating, and advising the Government on policy; and yet there is very little effective scrutiny of how NBEET operates and the role that it plays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those remarks, I turn now to this very important report which, essentially, arises out of issues that were canvassed in the Finn report and the Mayer report. Both of these reports, related to competency-based training and restructuring of our TAFE sector, have been very industry driven&mdash;driven by the needs of industry rather than by what constitutes a broad-based education and how a broad-based general education can deliver to Australia the kinds of skills it needs to catapult it into the international economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that, after much soul searching in the next five years as to the direction that training policy has taken in this country, we will see the Government do a U-turn and recognise that at this time&mdash;that is, 1992-93&mdash;far too much emphasis in training policy has been put on the needs of industry at the expense of a general broad-based education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Competency' is a word that is bandied around very broadly in education circles. What I have discovered in my work is that it means many things to different people. It is certainly a question that needs to be ironed out. I do not know whether this NBEET advice has actually seriously dealt with that question. The universities have very serious concerns about the application of key competencies to a university degree. That is an issue that this Government must really comes to grips with. It has not done so, and NBEET has not done so in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We partly agree that the Higher Education Council must seek to continue to reconcile the issues of competency and credit transfer. It has tried to address that in this report. I hope that this will be a starting point for debate. It is an issue that we will continue to scrutinise in this Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)reaffirms its responsibility as the permanent house of review in the democratic structure of the Commonwealth of Australia;</PARA>

<PARA>The agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is a matter of concern to many Australians. One suspects that, despite his protestations that he is concerned with the so-called minimalist conversion to the republic, he has in mind something much greater. An article appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> recently written by David O'Reilly, who I think has good connections within the Labor Party. He put it in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the prime minister has achieved his life-long political dream of winning sufficient unfettered political power to remake the nation according to his own vision.</PARA>
<PARA>That is of concern to us and to so many Australians. The core of this debate today specifically is the intervention yesterday by the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, when he, in effect, called for the abolition of upper houses. The upper house of Queensland has gone, but the other States and our federal system have the benefit of upper houses not only as houses of review but also as a restraint on the power of the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one reflects very briefly on what power there would be within this Parliament to restrain Mr Keating if the Senate did not exist, one would realise very quickly that there would be very little. Mr Acting Deputy President, do you realise that this week&mdash;only the second week into the parliamentary session&mdash;the House of Representatives is already operating under a guillotine? So, members of the House of Representatives are not given proper opportunity to debate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the level of legislative accountability that the House of Representatives has in our constitutional structure. That is the very limited opportunity that is given to members elected to the lower house in our federal structure to meet their responsibility of reviewing legislation put to them by the government. That means that the only chamber that can properly fulfil that role is the upper house in our constitutional structure, the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a matter the Government's legislative program&mdash;I think the Government has dumped on the House of Representatives something like 70 Bills to debate in the course of a few days this week under the guillotine that it has imposed. It is also a matter of financial accountability. It is this chamber, the upper house of the Parliament of Australia, which really fulfils the responsibility of accountability, of ensuring that the elected government in this country is accountable to the people through the parliamentary process. We do that through our estimates procedure. We used to do it through comprehensive debate in the Committee of the Whole in this place until the Government and the Australian Democrats conspired this week to cut out that process. We will nevertheless continue as best we are able to ensure that in financial matters the Government is responsible to the Australian people through the proper functioning of this chamber. It is this chamber and that responsibility that our Prime Minister, Mr Keating, would wish to abolish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard yesterday that one of the few remaining State Labor Premiers in this country also would wish to see the Senate abolished. The attitude of the Prime Minister to the Australian Senate is well-known. We had the debate last year on his abusive comments when he referred to this chamber as `unrepresentative swill'. He made those offensive comments because he found that the Senate was a restraint upon his executive power, and he resorted to such abusive language. That followed his revelation to students of De La Salle college only a few days before, on 11 September of last year, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We shouldn't have a Senate, basically. It's an impediment to the smooth operation of the parliamentary system.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, `We shouldn't have a Senate, basically. It's an impediment to the way in which I, Mr Keating, wish to govern this country'. That is why the people of Australia have constantly supported the retention of the Australian Senate. They have done it because they have become concerned about the over-centralisation of power and, in this instance, using again the words of Mr O'Reilly, the almost unfettered power of the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in terms of the government that has just been elected in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister wants to abolish the Australian Senate. He wants to remove the restraint that that has on his executive power. We learnt yesterday that Mr Goss, the Premier of Queensland, is of the same mind. Mr Goss dresses it up by saying that he wants the Senate abolished because it no longer represents the States. I know the history of the Australian Senate and the fact that political parties have exercised greater power as the years have gone by. In fact, if a Labor senator got out of line he or she would be expelled. Nevertheless, basically senators in this place are conscious of their responsibilities to their States, do represent their States and put forward matters that are of particular concern to their States. So that is hardly an excuse for wishing to abolish the Senate. Therefore, one can only come back to the same sentiment that was expressed by the Prime Minister, that for the moment it is basically a nuisance to him. That is why he no longer wishes it to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we know one part of the Prime Minister's wider agenda of constitutional reform. He wants a republic. He wants to abolish the position of the Governor-General. He also wants to have major constitutional reform of the principal structures of the parliamentary system in this country&mdash;that is, he wants to abolish the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We also wonder about an even wider agenda of the Prime Minister. His attitude to the Australian flag, for example, is well known. Last year we had the humiliating experience of his going to Jakarta and announcing to Asia that it was his intention to get rid of the Australian flag. He said that he found the flag somewhat un-Australian because it had the Union Jack as part of it. He went on to make a similar statement in Papua New Guinea immediately after his trip to Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has not hesitated from saying it since. He promised so many that we will soon have a new flag and that he would be causing a submission to be brought to Cabinet. In fact, he wishes to abolish from our structures and our traditions anything that might have some British connotation. That is part of his agenda&mdash;abolish the States and abolish the flag. One wonders what the next step after that will be. We hear from other Labor spokesmen that the next step is, in fact, to abolish the States themselves because they are also an impediment to centralised control, to centralised power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have sought to do, by bringing this debate to the Senate for its attention today, is to remind the Australian Government that we will fight the attempts by the Prime Minister to gain unfettered control of our parliamentary system. We will commit ourselves to the Australian people to ensure that the Prime Minister will not be able to achieve constitutional reform that removes the traditional safeguards on executive power. We will fight to maintain symbols, such as the flag, that are so important to many Australians. We will fight to maintain a system that shares power between the States and the central authority, the Commonwealth of Australia, because within that there is a greater safeguard against abuse of power. That is the message that we wanted to bring to the Senate today, in the terms of the notice of motion given by Senator Boswell yesterday. That is the reason why I so proudly stand here today and support Senator Boswell by moving that motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I gave notice of this motion on behalf of Senator Hill and on my own behalf. I did so in response to the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, who yesterday launched what I believe was a direct assault on the Senate. He told the press:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We might as well abolish the Senate, because it no longer represents the States.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said at a later press conference that getting rid of upper houses, including the Senate, was `a good place to start' in that it would get rid of a few politicians. That is a very populist sort of statement from a Premier who, I believe, has been down to Canberra on very few occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Goss has displayed his ignorance on how the Senate works. The Senate does represent the States. The Senate has 12 senators representing each of the States of Tasmania, Western Australia, South Australia and even Queensland. Victoria and New South Wales have an equal number of senators representing them. Those senators make their contributions on committees. They make their contributions in the Caucus and the joint party rooms. They reflect the views that are held in their States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone from the Australian Labor Party who could be a fly on the wall in our joint party room would know how Senator Bjelke-Petersen stands up for Queensland and how Senator Walters stands up for Tasmania&mdash;how they argue their position on behalf of their States. Those views are reflected in legislation, in the committee system, and in the estimates committees. To remove senators for those States would destroy the ability of the smaller States to be represented. On very rare occasions senators will stand up for their particular States in this chamber and support the industries in their States. I have been known to do that myself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Goss made his views clear. I believe he let the cat out of the bag. Up until 1970 it was always the platform of the Labor Party that the Senate would be either emasculated or reduced to nothing. That is where we are at the moment. The Prime Minister is pushing this republican debate, claiming that he is going for a minimalist position, but Australia is worried about what that minimalist position is and where it is going to lead us. It is like unravelling a sock; one does not know where it is going to end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are the States going to be emasculated?  Are they going to be reduced?  It is certainly the wish of the Labor Party because it has always supported a form of regional governments in Australia. If there is any doubt about what the Labor Party wants to do, let us look at a speech that was made on 22 October 1991 when the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) addressed the National Press Club. Mr Keating saw new federalism as a dark plot to restore a measure of real power and independence to the States. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no case for reversing 90 years of constitutional development and surrendering substantial revenue powers to the States.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, `So long as we have the purse, we will control them. We will give them money as long as they do what we tell them to do'. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no case for the Commonwealth to injure its ability to manage the national economy or for it to diminish its ability to remedy national shortcomings.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the elected members of the States have not got enough brains to remedy any national shortcomings and all brains, all power and anyone who has any ability is down in this Parliament or in this Senate, because the States count for nothing. There he said it. Mr Goss comes in now and agrees with the Prime Minister. If Mr Goss believes that he cannot remedy the national shortcomings, he should not endorse what Mr Keating has said. The Prime Minister also said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no case for the Commonwealth to renounce its interest in education or housing or in any other area where there is a national dimension as well as a State and a local dimension.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not downplaying the States' role, I do not know what is. Let there be no misunderstanding at all: this Government does not want any State governments; it does not believe that they have any ability; it believes that they are a frustration; and it wants to get rid of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we start to move down that republic road&mdash;once we start to abandon the Westminster system that Australians have known, trusted and relied on&mdash;we do not know where we are going; we have one foot on the sticky paper and it will not be long before we get the next foot on. There will be no retreat.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> All those people out there who are blindly saying `I want a republic' should take it down to the next step. What is the next step? Do they want the States? Do they want a Senate&mdash;their insurance policy?  The Senate is a chamber that looks after their interests, represents the smaller States and reviews legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at some of the things that this chamber has done in the last term of government. The Government brought in registration charges of $47,000 to register a semitrailer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We took it to a Senate committee and we won. The charges are now $4,000 right throughout Australia. That could never have happened without a Senate. I mention also anti-dumping legislation. This chamber&mdash;and I give full marks to both sides of the chamber as well as the Australian Democrats&mdash;saw a problem with the immense quantities of food coming into Australia, $2.6 billion worth, I think, much of which was subsidised primary production. We took it to a committee. We came down jointly with a better form of anti-dumping legislation. The fishing legislation was another case. I could go on and on with other examples.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber has always given a more realistic view of the Government's legislation. The people of Australia want the Senate to remain. I have statistics with me that indicate that 80 per cent of Australian people want the Senate. They recognise the importance of the Senate and in no circumstance do they want it removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Goss wants to fly in the face of 80 per cent of the people of Australia he is very unwise. I do not believe Mr Goss is fool. He put his toe in the water today and got it burnt and he is now backtracking at 100 miles an hour. He said today, `Well, it is not my main issue. I am not going to lead the charge. I am not going to do anything. It is a point of view but I will stick to it'. But he is now backing away from that statement, as well he should because 80 per cent of Australian people do not want the powers of the Senate removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly worried about Mr Keating. I do not know what Mr Keating wants in the republican issue, but I do not think it is as simple as replacing the Queen as the Head of State with a governor-general. There are too many hidden agendas in this proposal. When one looks at what Mr Keating is saying&mdash;and my colleague Senator Hill produced a paper that indicated his views&mdash;one realises there is no doubt that he and the Labor Party want to emasculate the Senate. I did some research and came up with a speech that the Prime Minister made on 22 October 1991 in which he stated that he wanted to reduce the power of the States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How are the people of Australia going to elect a president? That person will be given the keys to the RAAF, the Navy and the Army. What sort of power does that person have then? That person would be the elected President, have a mandate and would be the commander-in-chief of the defence forces. He or she would then be the most powerful person in Australia. We have to look at all these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important motion that we are debating today. The Opposition is condemning Mr Goss for his ill-informed campaign to abolish the Upper Houses of Parliament, including the Senate. His comment was made on the spur of the moment, but there is no doubt that that is the Labor Party's position. It is a position that it has taken for some time. No-one in this chamber would doubt that ultimately the Labor Party would wish to abolish the Senate if it could achieve that goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we follow blindly the path Mr Goss wants us to follow we will emasculate the States, lose the power of the Senate and lose the Australian public's insurance policy or reduce it to a rubber stamp like the House of Lords, which has very little power. The founding fathers rightly gave this nation a Senate with powers. No-one wants to remove those powers, let alone Senator Bjelke-Petersen, who is following me in this debate. She believes in the monarchy, she believes in the Westminster system and she believes in the Parliament as it is now. So do most Queenslanders. In fact 80 per cent of Australians do not want any reduction in the powers of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I urge my fellow senators to join Senator Hill and myself in condemning Premier Goss's intemperate remarks and reaffirming the fundamental role that the Senate plays in our system of government. I hope we can put it to a vote. We will not totally carry the vote but I believe the Democrats will support us in some form or other because if they do not they will be supporting their own demise. The Democrats have little choice but to vote with us on this motion. I hope we do win this vote so we can show all Australians that the Senate condemns Mr Goss for his intemperate remarks. Perhaps it will be a lesson to him to think before he engages his mouth. </PARA>

It does not put a motion to discuss, analyse, generally criticise and put forward alternative policies on unemployment; it does not raise great issues of health policy; and it does not raise any matters relating to health or social security. The Opposition does not raise the broad sweep of international issues, from Somalia to Bosnia and Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Opposition senators raise is the incestuous obsession of conservatives with the very institution they inhabit.

The Opposition designates the second opportunity to raise great national issues under private business to an off-handed remark by the Premier of Queensland who was probably only intending to tease them anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That remark has excited the Opposition very greatly. It has meant that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and the Leader of the National Party have had to make speeches and that every other crass right-winger in the Senate will line up to put his or her particular point of view. I think this debate is a waste of the Senate's time. It is just a matter of giving those opposite an opportunity to puff themselves up and think that they are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Senator Tate knows why this motion has been raised today. It is because the Opposition has policies on no other issues. Following the last federal election every conservative coalition policy was thrown out the window. In fact we will have to go through a two-year waiting period to see what emerges next. The coalition senators have no other policy to put forward here today and the one issue they can unite on is their own self-interested occupation of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason they have raised this motion today is that they are so divided on everything else. After the last federal election every one had to get a job in the Opposition to make sure that Mr Hewson would be secure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a great spectacle we have seen in the last couple of months. We have seen someone offered a shadow Ministry that was not good enough for her. The real reason sits in the front row opposite. Senator Macdonald and Senator Boswell were going to be higher in seniority than that particular individual. Maybe on their performances they deserved to get it, but that just could not be copped. So we get a second round offer of a shadow ministry to Mr Connolly, and he accepts. Having been left out of the first 34, I would have had a little more pride than to accept and to come in off the interchange bench because someone did not want it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at all the other criticisms we have seen. The former member for Bass, Mr Warwick Smith, has been giving a full-blown analysis of what is wrong in the Opposition&mdash;and they have been very telling criticisms.

He has never actually made the front bench, he has never even been considered for it, but he has become an important backbench critic. Now, in these circumstances, fancy giving that person any prominence at all, his having had such a mediocre and undistinguished career.

While we are discussing the deputy leader's position, I am sure everyone is interested to know which Victorian Liberal MP asked Mr Costello to run and said he would support him and then rung Mr David Jull and said, `I am right behind you with my votes', and finally switched to Mr Michael Wooldridge, who subsequently won.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should at least be gracious and congratulate Mr Wooldridge for achieving the deputy leadership in the House of Representatives. That means that out of the eight leadership positions&mdash;four in the Labor Party and four in the Liberal Party&mdash;Collingwood supporters consist of exactly half of the leadership of this country, and so it should be. While I am in a gracious mood, may I congratulate Senator Boswell on being given a shadow portfolio. A three-year wait in the wilderness to be trusted has been truly rewarded and we look forward to a better performance from Senator Boswell than the one he gave today. I thought he was a little inhibited by the responsibilities of office from delivering a coherent speech. I look forward to the person we know with great affection as Boz making a great contribution in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill referred in his speech to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> by Mr David O'Reilly. I read it with some interest and agree with Senator Hill that it was an interesting article. It was not as interesting as the article&mdash;I think in the same copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that went into great detail about the future preselection changes in New South Wales. It was pointed out that seven of the eight lower house members&mdash;eight out of 50, in case anyone opposite did not know, which is only 16 per cent of representation by the Liberal Party in House of Representatives seats&mdash;were all going to get the chop. Mr Connolly, Mr Ruddock, Mr Cadman, Mr Dobie, Mr Howard  were all for the chop. The list of those who were going to replace them was, quite frankly, very disappointing. I am sure anyone who read that list would have been monumentally disappointed that the recruiting ground for the Liberal Party was to be from these particular individuals. So I say to Senator Hill that Mr O'Reilly's article was interesting, but I do recommend he go back and read that other article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a variety of arguments advanced as to why the Senate should be retained. Every now and then a reference is made&mdash;and there was reference made again today&mdash;that the Senate is a States house. I am not a great student of history. I do not know when this ceased to be a States house but I suspect it was around about World War I. The reason it never became a States house is simply because of the block voting system that was instituted in 1901, apart from, I think, two States which used proportional representation. I think Senator Maguire's home State may have as well. Once we got into the block voting winner-take-all, it became very much a party house. If a party got a majority of the votes in a first past the post sense plus one, it took a clean sweep of the whole Senate. In fact, that was why, as we look back into history, we ran the four-As in New South Wales in about 1938. So we had the first four in a row on the ballot paper and we were able to get the majority of the votes because they were all grouped and the vote did not spray. So up until 1949 we had this block vote thing that basically returned a party with absolute control of this particular chamber. So it was never a States house, it is not a States house today, and never has been since after the First World War. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Walters that this has never been a States house. This place becomes a house of review when we have Labor governments with conservative control or influence in the Senate, never at any other time. Over the years we have listened to the conservatives saying, `Look at the Victorian Legislative Council. We are being totally responsible in reviewing Labor Government legislation'. Do honourable senators think there is any review of any legislation going on in the Victorian Legislative Council now that it has a majority? Absolutely not! Ride roughshod over everyone's rights when they get 50 per cent plus one! That is the philosophy of the conservatives&mdash;only use upper houses to prevent reform processes. That is their attitude to upper houses. That is why even up until 1960 Senator Kemp's party had property qualifications in the Legislative Council in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Opposition talks about the Senate being a house of review, it means that it is really a house of review when conservatives can cobble together a majority to stop any reforms going through.

It will be 47 1/2 per cent representation to the Liberal Party, 39 per cent to the Labor Party and 9.2 per cent to the Democrats. Why are we under-represented in that sense? Not through any conspiracy or intrinsic unfairness.

Did they suggest once that committee chairmanship should be shared with those on this side of the chamber? No, they did not. Did they ever vote for the guillotine? Apart from about 20 occasions, no, they did not. They only voted for the guillotine at the end of each session of Parliament. They only did it about 10 times. Not only did they not vote for the guillotine, but they gagged the debate on the guillotine. They have learnt the lesson now. Ten sterile years in the Senate have brought out better qualities in these individuals. Now they are great supporters of the institution of parliament. Now they are great democrats.

Certainly the Government is doing its best to make sure that there is no talkfest in the Senate because, since I have been in the Senate, speeches during second reading debates have been cut in length from one hour to 30 minutes. Yesterday, the Senate passed legislation to reduce the time to 20 minutes for those speeches. I wonder whether one day, when I am no longer in the Senate, I will read that the time limit for speeches has been cut from 20 minutes to 10 minutes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that the Senate is an essential part of the balance of powers, built into the Constitution to protect against unbridled power wielded by the majority view expressed in the House of Representatives.

Much time is spent in the Senate trying to improve legislation passed by the House of Representatives under the guillotine where, because of the Government's numbers, the Opposition has no chance of making amendments that it thinks are necessary.

Indeed, I believe that its eventual plan is also to abolish the States and centralise all power in Canberra. It wants to open up the whole Constitution to attack and change. The Labor Government appointed Mr Bill Hayden, one of its previous Treasurers, as Governor-General. He can easily be asked to step down and fit in with the abolition of the present Constitution and system of government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a disaster.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that governments in lower houses can ruthlessly suppress debate, can use a guillotine as a matter of routine, not as a matter of absolute urgency, frustration and necessity. We have a guillotine motion in the House of Representatives this week, dealing with 30 pieces of legislation. In the Senate we have had four whole days of debate on Senate procedure and two pieces of legislation in two weeks. I have to say it makes me often gaze wistfully at the thought of a guillotine under these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Question Time in the Queensland Parliament was closed down. This is a time when the Parliament of Queensland is supposed to be accountable to the people of Queensland. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has referred to Question Time as a privilege bestowed upon the Parliament by the Government. I wonder whether this means that both Mr Keating and Mr Goss believe that it is not the duty of government to be accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beauty of a bicameral system is that no matter what a government chooses to do in the lower house there is still a chance to review legislation in the upper houses. To the extent that there is government control in the upper houses both in Victoria and Western Australia, perhaps we can say that the voters there may have made the choice. They may have said, `Yes, we trust the Government to have control of both houses'. But there will still be occasions when the Government can be defeated. The Prime Minister referred to probably the most famous example of this concerning the attempt by Jack Lang to stack the Legislative Council in New South Wales and then to abolish it. What happened was that those appointees enjoyed being on the Council so much that they refused to vote for its abolition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the usual reason that conservative parties obtain majorities in these two upper chambers is the voting system employed. There is still nowhere near one vote one value in the Legislative Council in Western Australia and there are still problems in the Victorian voting system. This does not mean that the houses should be abolished as a result of that; it means that they should be made more democratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electoral laws are a classic example of why we need upper houses. My State of Queensland was governed for more than three decades by the National Party. It won because the previous Labor Government had rorted the electoral laws and introduced the zonal system. This was further refined by the Nationals, both by increasing the malapportionment and by some pretty well-known and breathtakingly blatant gerrymandering. I believe we had an undemocratic government for a decade. We still have a smaller zonal system operating there today. So I argue not in some abstract way but as a result of direct experience that upper houses are necessary to stop the debauching of electoral systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other major areas which must be subject to review, not just electoral systems. Perhaps the most important issue here is the question of the constitutions of the States. State constitutions can be changed by a simple Act of Parliament in most States. Provisions can also be entrenched into State constitutions so that they cannot be reversed without a referendum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason why we need upper houses concerns many other legislative decisions of government. State governments can compulsorily acquire property without compensation. They can massively increase the powers of government agencies such as the police. They can pass laws which threaten freedom of speech or expression. They can pass laws which include oppressive criminal laws. For example, just today the Queensland Government announced the siting of a radioactive waste dump at a place called Esk, a decision totally contrary to the views of the residents of that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber we have had to work with the Queensland Liberal senators to bring to the attention of people in Queensland such issues as the casino tendering process, the alleged rorting of the Queensland Professional Officers Association superannuation fund, and the issue of Metway Bank. In many respects this chamber has acted as a de facto upper house for the non-existent Queensland upper house. I think the people of Queensland appreciate our existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple point is that there must be checks and balances. Exactly the same holds true at the national level. This Senate is the only check on the Keating Government. I know it annoys him; it frustrates him, but it is absolutely and fundamentally necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some will say that abolishing the upper houses is simply allowing governments to govern. I think that is rubbish. Government is an incredibly complex task. There are many hundreds of areas of public policy. It is just wrong to assert that voting for a government means that the elector accepts the policy of the particular candidate in every facet; of course the voter does not. For example, there are members of the public who vote for the coalition but, at the same time, favour Australia's becoming a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electors choose their government on the basis of who would be better to run the State or the country. It does not mean that electors give that government carte blanche. Many would argue that the recent Federal election was a rejection of a greater evil, not a sign of great confidence in the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a history attached to upper houses, as we know, and there is a history of Labor Party opposition. One can understand that because colonial upper houses were the first level of government. They were undemocratic and they were stacked with the rich and the powerful of the day. After the general public was granted the vote and lower houses were formed, there is no doubt that upper chambers frustrated democracy. But, I have said before, that is the voting system, it is not the existence of the upper house or the system of appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray touched on the events of 1975. The powers of the Senate were misused in 1975 in my view. All Australian Democrats are on record as saying that the episode was a disgrace and that the power to block Supply should not exist. Since we have been in a position of balance of power here, that has not been an issue. But the answer is to reform the processes, not to destroy the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate was a necessary precondition for Australia's nationhood. It remains a necessary precondition for good government in Australia. It is true, as Senator Ray said, that this place is a party house and not a States house most of the time, but there are still some important exceptions. One particular exception is the issue of sugar, and Senator Bjelke-Petersen referred to this. National Party senators joined with the Democrats in the sugar tariff debate. But the same was not said for the Liberal senator who represents Queensland, Senator Macdonald, because he made a choice between representing party interests as against representing the State interests of the Queensland sugar growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this chamber now operates in the same way as other chambers is no reason to abolish it. As long as the system of proportional representation remains, there will always be an effective system of review, which is essential for a democratic society. Mr Goss wants to abolish upper houses to get rid of some politicians. That might be a laudable aim. A lot of people in the community would probably agree with it. But if the aim is to lower the number of parliamentarians, it can be done in another way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that there needs to be structural reform of the political system. We have a three-tiered system of government&mdash;local, State and Federal. There is not even constitutional recognition for local government. We believe that the three tiers of government can be cut to two. It seems that perhaps the obvious way to go is to get rid of the middleman by abolishing States. When I say that, I do not mean that Queensland will cease to exist. State boundaries could remain, which means that things such as Sheffield Shield cricket and State of Origin football could continue exactly as they do now. The nation would insist that we get our priorities right, I am sure. What we are proposing is that political jurisdictions be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system was appropriate a hundred years ago, when it was established, but it is outdated and inefficient now. Quite apart from the ridiculous idea that Australia is a collection of States instead of a nation, it is incredibly inefficient and wasteful to have duplication of government services. I think one of the great ironies of conservative philosophy is that conservatives are great supporters of States rights, but they will go to the wall opposing a bill of rights guaranteeing people basic rights. So people do not have rights but political entities do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and time again we hear that the people on the Opposition's side of the chamber want efficient public services. If that is the case, why do they not support the massive reform which rationalising the structure of government would bring? Why do they persist in supporting an inefficient, archaic structure? This system means that, to get the level of public services they are now enjoying, Australians are paying a lot more tax than they need to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do the champions of efficient government not really embrace efficient government? Why does the National Party not support the idea of enhanced regional government? The real issue in the Queensland bush is not the power of Canberra; it is the power, dominance and remoteness of Brisbane. Why should people in Mount Isa be ruled from Brisbane? Why should people in Cairns or Rockhampton or Townsville be controlled by bureaucrats in Brisbane?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald has talked about the need for a new State in North Queensland. The kind of system that I am proposing means that we can have a national law where appropriate and a local law where appropriate, instead of the current situation in which artificial State borders delineate legal systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of Senator McMullan and Senator Reid, all members of this chamber hopped on a plane for a couple of hours to get to the ACT. The law here is radically different in many ways from that of the States. There are acts which are legal here which are crimes in some of the States. Who can possibly know what all the laws are for? For example, labelling laws differ from State to State for the same products.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, does anybody seriously suggest that we are worse off now because we have a national system of regulation of companies? We have a more efficient and effective system of regulation. It is not dominance by Canberra; it is protection of the community from the dominance of stupid parochial interest acting against the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to see that the Business Council of Australia has addressed this issue. It has not given details of its preferred model, but it has called for a reduction in the number of levels of government from three to two. Given that we have a national government, I think that what it is proposing is fairly obvious&mdash;and I agree with it. More efficient government means less cost for industry and more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why Senator Macdonald is against this logic, but I will join with the Opposition in defence of the review role of the Senate. It plays an important&mdash;indeed, vital&mdash;role by questioning the Government, whether it be in the estimates committees or the legislation committees. Indeed, at the moment the Senate is the only body which can effectively review the actions of the Goss Government&mdash;although it cannot force it to do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at why Wayne Goss, in a throwaway line, thought first of the powers of the Senate. He just loves operating without the checks and balances of an upper house. He has no upper house. He has government control of all committees. If somebody such as Peter Beattie criticises him, he gets rid of Peter Beattie and starts to wind down the CJC or gets rid of the Electoral and Administrative Review Committee. He has an unhealthy control of media reporting. He attempts to discredit the former police commissioner, and he suppresses allegations and information about the level of ministerial intervention in the current police force. It is very frightening. With the greatest of respect to Senator Flo Bjelke-Petersen, I really think that Mr Wayne Goss is slowly metamorphosing; all he needs is the corks on the hat. The Fitzgerald process that we have been through in Queensland seems to count for nothing. The people in Queensland have nowhere to go except to this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the thrust of this motion; however, we do not believe in States rights because we believe that people&mdash;not political entities&mdash;have rights.

Whatever he really believes, and whatever his longer term agenda really is, yesterday he said unequivocally that the Government will not be pursuing the abolition of this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are more or less debating Mr Goss's words, `We might as well abolish the Senate because it no longer represents the States'. I can only agree with the Liberal Party deputy leader in the Queensland Parliament, Mr Santo Santoro, when he described Mr Goss as a constitutional vandal. I suppose that is why the Labor Government today embarked upon a most despicable racist attack upon Mr Santoro because of the role he has played in drawing Mr Goss's comments to the attention of the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has a great record in Queensland of undermining upper houses. It was of course the Labor Government in Queensland which abolished the upper house there back in 1922. I would have liked to have had time to go through the history of that. It is quite elucidating, very educational and gives an idea of the Labor Party agenda on these sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating is on record as referring to the Senate as unrepresentative swill, so that is obviously what he thinks about us. It is not the first time that Mr Goss has attacked the upper house. He is well quoted last year as saying that the proposal by the Liberal Party to look at some brakes on the government was just gimmickry. Of course Mr Keating's hero, Jack Lang, wanted to abolish the upper house in New South Wales but failed to do so because some of his suicide squad ratted on the deal and decided not to abolish the upper house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have Senator Evans and Senator Schacht, both of whom are on record as wanting to get rid of the Senate. I think the extreme positions being taken by Labor Party people in Queensland to a great extent results from Senator Kernot's anti-Queensland and anti-Senate actions in the last few months, which I find quite amazing, of wanting to abolish the States and, of course, with that the States house. She has some other funny proposal about regional governments which will mean the death-knell of local government in Australia if&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to ask Senator Reynolds to take part in this debate because I know what her views are. She was reported last night on television as opposing Mr Goss on this issue. I understand that Senator Reynolds is a strong supporter of the role of the Senate, and I am sure for that reason she will be voting with us when this motion is put to a vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of my colleagues who still want to speak in the remaining nine minutes, so regrettably I will have to sit down. If Senator Reynolds wants to come into the chamber and speak in support of this motion, as I am sure, from her stated position yesterday, she would, I know that my colleagues would allow her sufficient time to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes I have, I certainly cannot give a learned treatise on the place of upper houses. But I enter this debate only because of what Senator Ray had to say. I have a great deal of respect for Senator Ray, but he has really cracked under the pressure. I do not know whether it is the fact that the Government is not giving him enough money to run his department in a decent way or whether it is the pressure of some of those terrible people in the Cabinet. But he certainly did not make any contribution at all to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We got into this debate because of the very superficial knowledge of a Mr Goss in Queensland, who simply has no understanding of the philosophy of the exercise of power. He just has a typical immature Labor view about it&mdash;the belief that, `The winner takes all' and, `You don't have to answer for what you do'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this country has a very sophisticated Constitution. We have probably the most advanced system of government in the world. The fact that some of us, who are elected to implement that system of government, fall short of attaining the full possibilities that are inherent in the system is another matter. But there is nothing wrong with the system itself, and a vital part of that system is the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critics of the upper house say that it is no longer a States house, and Senator Ray had quite a run on that point. The facts of life are that parliament must operate on a party system. If it does not have a party system, there is simply no stability in government. If honourable senators do not believe me, they should have a look at the dreadful problems that Papua New Guinea has where party allegiances are not very tight at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make two points about the States house situation. First of all, we may not vote as a block of Queenslanders or New South Wales people here, but the very fact that equivalent representation is provided for the States means that there are big blocks of people from each State in the party rooms. Senator Kernot would not know this because she is not part of a responsible, mature party. But within the developed major parties in this Parliament, State representation in the Senate provides a very powerful brake on any power grabbing by the Victorian and New South Wales numbers, who are in the majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would make about the States house is that I have been in this place now for a very long time. I have certainly been here for all the time that the Labor Government has been in power in Queensland. Despite the fact that my door is always open, I have not heard one syllable from Labor members. I have not had a request for help or a request to explain a point of view where Queensland's interests are involved in the Federal Parliament. That is Mr Goss's fault, not mine. If we do not have a decent house of review, we just fall into the old trap that `power corrupts' and `absolute power corrupts absolutely'. As Senator Kernot quite rightly pointed out, we see that very clearly in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not think the Queensland Government is corrupt in any way at all now, I can see all the signs of the pressure of events driving it over the precipice. I have no doubt that in another term, if it is still there, we will see corners being cut and standards falling away. It just happens inevitably. The way the Queensland Government has set up a CJC, a body which is not elected, and an electoral review commission, is testimony to the fact that it cannot control and monitor its own affairs with respect to standards.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a democrat, I am very opposed to giving great powers to people who do not hold elected positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not only the fact that the Queensland Government has set up these bodies. It has clearly interfered with the operation and the independence of these bodies. The committee in the Queensland Parliament which is monitoring the CJC has been a constant source of discomfort and controversy for the Goss Government, so much so that its the chairman, Mr Beattie, who tried in a very moderate and restrained way to exercise the responsibilities of his office, was unceremoniously garrotted and dumped at the first opportunity Mr Goss could do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point that I started on: we cannot have in a democratic system the right to exercise power without being accountable for it. At the heart of this debate is the matter of accountability. This chamber is the chamber in which that accountability of the executive government of the day is exercised and it cannot be limited without being lost. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak particularly briefly, as I understand from my colleagues that time is indeed very short. I support the motion which has been moved by Senator Hill. I think the motion draws attention to one of the more troubling aspects of this whole debate on the institutional structure of Australia: we are seeing from the Labor Party a major attack on the institutions which have served this country well for 92 years. It seems to me that Mr Goss, in some way, perhaps through carelessness, has broken ranks and broken the implicit agreement of `For heavens sake, don't talk about what our true agenda is'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plain fact of the matter is that in this country today the Labor Party has laid down a very radical and, in some ways, extreme agenda to change the institutional structure of this country. Mr Goss has done us all a favour by revealing one particular aspect of that agenda. That particular aspect is, of course, to abolish the Senate. The Labor Party, when in power, has always bucked against any restraints on the exercise of that power. We are seeing this in the Government's campaign against the head of state, we are seeing it in its campaign against State governments and we are seeing it in the campaign that Mr Goss has revealed in respect of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would commend this motion to the Senate. It is an important motion in that it calls on the Senate to stand up for its rights. It is important to expose the true agenda of the Labor Party. I urge all honourable senators to support this motion and condemn the actions of Premier Goss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Knowles. I had made the point that the proposal to reduce the number of committees is absolutely disgraceful. I did say some unkind words about the Democrats, but in view of recent negotiations, I will not repeat those just at this moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee on transport, communications and infrastructure is also very important. I was involved in some of its inquiries whilst I was a member. In particular, I referred to the inquiry into the very fast train proposal, and specifically mentioned the fine work that my colleague Senator Margaret Reid had done during that inquiry. Just before the adjournment of the debate I was talking about the inquiry into satellite launching facilities within Australia. I indicated that it had been a very significant inquiry and certainly fully canvassed the satellite launching proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great things about these committees is that their inquiries&mdash;some of which are quite technical&mdash;widen the knowledge and experience of all senators. I had a political interest in the space base and its location in north Queensland. Having become involved in that inquiry, it was very interesting to understand all the ramifications and great benefits to the Australian economy from the space industry that we have had for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee was able to travel to the proposed site for the space base in North Queensland which is at Temple Bay. We were able to speak with Aboriginal and environmental groups about the situation of that particular location. We were also able to visit Woomera and see what is now left of what was obviously a leading edge in space technology in the 1950s and possibly the 1960s. It was at that time in the inquiry that I and other senators became aware of the very significant role that Australia played in the past in space technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a particularly important inquiry. The committee reported to the Government and in turn the Government responded. I hope this inquiry will provide a lot of information when these sorts of matters are discussed in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee on transport, communications and infrastructure then took on the very important role of looking at heavy vehicle charges. Mr Deputy President, as a Queenslander, you would be aware of the huge importance that the more diverse States such as Queensland and Western Australia place upon road transport. Matters relating to the charges that are affixed to heavy transports are very important to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee travelled the length and breadth of Australia. We went to Meekatharra, which is in Western Australian, and many parts of Queensland and took evidence from a wide range of groups interested in heavy vehicle charges. We were able to get a real understanding of the issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became fairly obviously that some members of the Labor Party on that committee were not too happy with some of the results we were getting because they were contrary to Labor Party policy. The committee found an enormous acceptance of the Liberal Party and National Party proposals to abolish fuel tax. That, if nothing else, came through clearly as a result of the inquiries we made and the people we talked to. Before the election was called, the committee's report on heavy road vehicle charges was presented to and dealt with by the Parliament, I might say fairly perfunctorily by members of the Government who were a bit embarrassed by some of the aspects of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we approached the end of the year the committee on transport, communications and infrastructure determined that it should inquire into both government supplied and voluntary agency supplied emergency services around Australia. That inquiry has not yet commenced but the members of the committee have, as I recall, settled the terms of reference for that inquiry. It would have been a major inquiry into matters of very great significance. Certainly in my State of Queensland where emergency services are often called upon in times of calamity resulting from cyclones&mdash;which are prevalent in North Queensland, the Northern Territory and the north-west of Western Australia&mdash;floods and bushfires that regrettably occur, these matters are considered to be important. All these matters were to be investigated by this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what will happen to that inquiry if the committee is not to continue. If that inquiry does not proceed it will deprive the Australian people of an in depth look at these emergency services and what reforms can be introduced. I suppose the Government will say that all of those inquiries will proceed and if the number of committees is reduced then the transport, communications and infrastructure inquiry will still not disappear. It will be incorporated into another committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not need to be a genius to work out that if we lump a committee with an enormous number of departments and areas to look at with another committee it then diminishes very greatly the time that combined committee will have to look into those particular matters. There was one proposal that the transport, communications and infrastructure committee could be lumped in with the industry, technology and commerce committee. That could be said to make sense. But it puts an enormous work load on the combined committee. </PARA>

In Western Australia it was the lowest it has been since 1977 when we almost won Fremantle; I think it was 38 per cent this time around. And the Liberal Party got 3.8 per cent of quotas. I can understand why there is an inevitable reduction in the numbers of the Labor Party. Because of that reduction, it has a reduced capacity to man committees; because of that factor, we are expected to have a reduced number of committees.

The one thing that we have a glorious reputation for is absolute and thorough democracy. If there is one thing that can be said about the Liberal Party in Western Australia, it is that it is the grassroots that speaks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There ought to be nine committees and I appeal to the Democrats to support that proposal because the Democrats have always carried a responsible position in respect of scrutiny of legislation. They have always been enthusiastic to set up select committees when they thought there was a purpose and a need. That contrasts very nicely with the ex-finance Minister, Senator Walsh, who was so enraged at the prospect of a piece of legislation actually getting thorough scrutiny by a committee that he threatened to cut off the funding for it. I suppose that is one way of choking democracy. It reminds me of the Stuart kings who used to decide how much money the parliament would get.

It might wish to look at international air travel or a monorail in Sydney. There are all sorts of subject matters that go beyond the scope of a dedicated rural committee.

<PARA>This matter came about during the period of the last Parliament when the processes of the chamber became bogged down because, after every Question Time, even on occasions when there was an urgency motion or an MPI, endless debates ensued with senators moving to take notice of an answer to a question given in Question Time. This particular sessional order was in place during the last Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Opposition is considering amendments to this to increase the time provided in this motion for an individual senator to speak, although there is no suggestion that the time for debate on all motions relating to answers be relaxed from 30 minutes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subparagraph (1)(b), omit "3", substitute "5".</PARA>
<PARA>The history of this matter is the abuse of Question Time during the last government when Ministers used the occasion of Question Time to abuse the Opposition for its policies in particular rather than to provide serious answers on public interest matters relating to their portfolio. During Question Time there is no opportunity for the Opposition to respond to such attacks. Therefore, more often than we had in the past, we used the practice of seeking leave to move a motion after Question Time to take note of a Minister's answer and to respond in order to correct the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That practice was only second best because now, in the days of television, members of the public have access to a Minister's answer through the direct television coverage, but of course they do not have access to the response of the Opposition after Question Time. Even though it was second best, we thought that it was a better practice than not pursuing such matters at all. At least it meant that within the chamber there was contemporaneous debate on issues that had disturbed the Opposition which had been raised by Ministers in answer to questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time the Government adopted the practice of refusing leave. That led to various suspensions and attempted suspensions. It was decided&mdash;I think by the former Manager of Government Business&mdash;that that was too much trouble, so the Government started giving leave almost as a matter of course. The Government, however, wanted some restraint on the maximum time for such debates. That led to the development of a sessional order such as the proposed one before the Senate now, setting aside a 30-minute period with designated timeslots for each speaker to deal with such matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that this motion is before the Senate again, because we think that the practice of dealing immediately thereafter with matters of a controversial nature that arise in Question Time is the Senate operating in a useful form. Some might say that it has led to more informative debates than some of the debates on matters of public importance which in the past tended to take up a great deal of this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be an argument as to how much time should be applied for this purpose. Some honourable senators on this side of the chamber would obviously argue, from an opposition perspective, that a half an hour is too limited. Nevertheless, that is the figure before the chamber at the moment and we will not seek to vary it at this time. The only variation that I will seek to make is to amend it so there is a maximum of five minutes per speaker, which is in accordance with the notice of motion I gave on the first day of this sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would also have liked the motion to be in a form that provided that, in a technical sense, leave was no longer necessary. As I read it, technically speaking, leave is still necessary, but because the Government is prepared to move this motion, I take it that it is recognising it as a practice it will respect in future, as it has in recent times. Therefore, we will support the motion, with the amendment&mdash;for which I seek the support of the Senate&mdash;that an honourable senator may speak for no more than five minutes on such a motion, rather than what the Government has provided in its form, which is that an honourable senator shall speak for no more than three minutes on such a motion. </PARA>

We were quite happy to accept 30 minutes divided into five-minute slots. We understand that the Opposition then wanted to go to three-minute allocations. Now it wants to go back to five. I just want to put the record straight with respect to that. Along with the Government, we are quite relaxed about whether it is three or five minutes, although I agree with the Opposition's present position that five minutes gives more adequate time to cover matters which are raised in questions, particularly as we give Ministers four minutes to answer a question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise another matter, not by way of amendment but just to signal our concern. It has become the practice in taking note of answers that if a particular honourable senator raises a matter in relation to a particular question, the person in the chair then asks the next person who rises whether he or she wishes to speak on the same matter. It is quite possible for the whole half-hour to be taken up with comments on the one question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a plea that in future we diverge from that pattern. For example, if a person is given the call and seeks to take note of question No. 3 and the next person with the call seeks to take note of question No. 5, I ask that it be taken in that sequence so that there is a fair distribution of the available half-hour for six speakers, rather than that the person who just happens to get the call first virtually dominates the whole half-hour. I do not think that needs to be written into any sort of an order or procedure. I think it is within the power of the Chair at the time to call speakers in that sort of order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is consistent with the principle that we are seeking to have implemented for all Senate committees&mdash;not just select committees but also standing committees&mdash;and, therefore, in principle we obviously agree with it. The principle is that, basically, in future the chairman will not automatically be a nominee of the Government but rather will be somebody selected by the chamber. I think that will be a major reform because the Senate will be taking control of the business of the Senate rather than allowing the Government to take control of the business of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had trouble in persuading the Australian Democrats, at least in the short term, to accept that principle in relation to standing committees. I indicated earlier that in relation to the motion to set up the standing committees, I would be moving an amendment to provide a form as I have just described so that the Chair would be decided in future by a majority in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have been temporarily unsuccessful in persuading the Democrats as to the merit of that proposal, I have decided not to press that amendment later tonight when we re-establish the standing committees. I do not want that to be interpreted in any way as backing away from the principle. We really do think it would be a good reform in the interests of the Senate and we intend to continue to seek to persuade the Australian Democrats as to the merit of that reform. We hope we will be ultimately successful and then we will be back in here in a flash with the form of the amendment that I had earlier circulated. </PARA>

We have re-established the select committee on the Victorian loans matter and that committee is actually structured so that a majority in the Senate can control the numbers. Senator Coulter will be continuing as chairman of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have re-established what I refer to as Senator Walters's community welfare committee which is dealing with telecommunications and Senator Reynolds will be continuing to chair that committee. We are pleased to support that. In this instance, we are wanting Senator Watson, who has had a distinguished record on this select committee, to take over as chairman of the Select Committee on Superannuation.

That will be concluded, as I understand, by the 30 June 1993 and Senator Sherry, who of course is now also carrying the onerous burden of being a Parliamentary Secretary, will stand down from that position in accordance with Senator Kernot's amendment. The majority in the Senate will decide a successor and that successor, we expect, will be Senator Watson. So I am pleased on that basis to support the amendment that has been moved by Senator Kernot.

But we are a little nervous at this stage, particularly in view of what happened in the chamber yesterday when we debated all day long whether we should reduce the speaking time at the second reading stage from 30 minutes to 20 minutes and the power of standing committees which are dealing with legislation to obstruct the proper consideration of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment amends the motion moved by Senator Faulkner so that, instead of moving from nine committees to seven, we will move from nine committees to eight. However, the requirement in the motion that Senator Faulkner moved for 28 Government senators, 21 Opposition senators and seven senators from minority groups and Independent senators will be retained. Of the eight committees, there will be four committees of eight members and four committees of six members and, in all cases, half of the committee members will be Government senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this description there is, effectively, the amalgamation of two of the standing committees that we have known over recent years. The two committees have become one and it is to be called the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. Because this is a regrettably large area of concern for one standing committee, we have ensured now that it is a committee with eight members. The one committee on which the minority groups and Independent senators are not represented is the Standing Committee on Finance and Government. In the last Parliament it did not include any representative from those senators, it only had three from the Government and three from the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a genuine compromise and we can still look at it with marginal regrets. Firstly, there is now a very large area of concern for one of the standing committees and we do regret that, but we have ensured that it has eight members. Secondly, we would see that from the Government's point of view, whilst there is still a call on 28 Senate positions to be provided by the Government&mdash;which was one of its major concerns with its reduced numbers of senators&mdash;it is still the same number.

I had thought that further consideration was being given by the Government and its advisers to this matter. As the Parliament knows, the philosophy behind the broadcasting services Bill is one of self-regulation, where the industry develops codes of practice and registers those codes of practice. If the ABA is not satisfied that those codes of practice have been drawn up after proper public consultation or if the terms of those codes of practice are inadequate, then the ABA can register a standard; it can make a decision which, in effect, is a standard.</PARA></TALK.START>

The amendment refers to schedule 2, part 6, clause 10(1)(g) which talks about a decision of the Australian Broadcasting Authority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment that has been moved by the Democrats is, to use a generic word, tougher than was previously envisaged, but I understand it. The central policy position of the Senate last year was that we would have a national subscription satellite service involving the Australian Broadcasting Corporation with two channels as part of a satellite system, with MDS able, at that time, to compete on an equal footing with the satellite which will include the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, MDS licensees will not be disadvantaged because they will be able to become broadcasters in a truly technological model. This is the central position that we adopted last year based on the assumption, wrongly as it turned out, that MDS could not threaten the viability of the satellite. MDS was always seen as an ancillary broadcaster. We will be able to commercially organise arrangements for it to be a rebroadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that Senator Alston is correct in saying that this would be an outside chance in 1994. I must say that it would be a fairly outlandish scenario that brought us to that point. That is worth pointing out because the provisions of the Act, and the penalties that apply, are fairly substantial. It would be in the most extreme scenario that we would go to that sunset date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I must say that I have no in-principle objection&mdash;and I told Senator Bourne this&mdash;to having the sunset clause at the end of 1994, which is a new provision. I guess that is a catch-all clause so I am not objecting to that because it picks up what would have to be an outlandish situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will describe what the outlandish situation would be that would make the end of 1994 very unlikely. Senator Bourne's amendment brings forward to March the time whereby licensees have to agree on a standard. When Senator Bourne was discussing with me earlier today her proposed amendments, I have to say that I mentioned July to put a generous time on it. In the original Act there was no time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reflection I must say&mdash;and I would be amazed if Senator Alston disagreed with me&mdash;that no-one can see everything. Flaws in Acts only occur when people find mistakes in them afterwards. I think it probably would have been wise of us to put the time limit on at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall the circumstances in which that legislation went through parliament. To be  perfectly frank I am amazed that it came out in as good a shape as it did. It was a fairly traumatic time and I have not forgotten the late night sittings. We have been debating procedures in the chamber today, and I must say that I certainly have not forgotten one procedure that occurred at that time that I have never seen before or since in the Senate. I have no doubt that everything that could possibly happen during the history of the Senate has happened. I did see one procedure that night that I have never seen before and Senator Alston may have forgotten about it. When we got to the point where we were once again discussing change we had Senator Alston, the former member for Bass and, I might add, the extraordinary presence in the advisers' box of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr John Hewson. At that stage we brought on the adjournment debate in the middle of the debate on the Bill in order to extend the time we had to seek advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have never seen that done before or since. We had about six adjournment speeches while we were all taking counsel together about how we would change the Bill. I have to concede&mdash;and I know that the Democrat senators and Senator Harradine will remind us of this&mdash;that it was not the most perfect way to put an Act together. Senator Powell pointed that out to us in very graphic terms. In fact I read her speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the other day and one could hardly argue with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not going to expand on this point tonight but, in respect of this amendment, it is probably an appropriate time to concede that. I do not think that was the Government's fault necessarily. It is easy now to talk about defects in the Act, but I do not think any senator who took part in the debate and was in here watching what was going on would disagree with me. We were faced with the extraordinary situation where the shadow Minister from the House of Representatives was in the advisers' box and he was then joined by the Leader of the Opposition, whom I have not seen before or since in the advisers' box in Senate chamber. Mind you, I am not saying that I want to see him there again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember one week when I did not physically leave my office in Parliament House for four days. That was the last week;  Senator Alston probably did not leave his office for four days either. I had departmental advisers in my office working on the constant changes that were flowing through from the Senate. I know that two of those officers, Tony Shaw and Christine Goode, who have been in the news lately, also did not leave my office for those four days, except to go home to change their clothes, have a shower and eat. I do not think it was the ideal way to pass an Act of Parliament through, and I am astonished that it survived as well as it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only am I agreeing with these amendments&mdash;and Senator Alston would agree with this&mdash;but also it was probably a sensible amendment which, when I reflected on it, we should have put in then. There was no time limit set in the Bill, but there is now. When Senator Bourne suggested March to me instead of July, I checked and I found that it should be possible for the people to do that. But there is another advantage to it, that is, because it is a firm time, it will provide a real impetus&mdash;and I am told this by industry sources&mdash;to put the resources into developing the digital technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The digital technology already exists. It is being broadcast on a trial basis around Australia now and I have to say it is a superb signal. The departmental laboratories here in Canberra have had access to it. It is being moved around Australia on a test basis and it is very impressive. So the technology already exists; it is simply a case of the commercial box to deliver it having to be developed. I am told that setting that date will provide a real impetus for that development to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potentially&mdash;and I am not overstating it because it may or may not happen&mdash;that will provide Australia with a very interesting advantage over every other country. We will be the first country in the world to develop digital PAL. There are, of course, many other PAL systems around the world. Once we have successful licence holders, resourced licence holders, once the licence is delivered&mdash;that is the key to it; we have to fix up that licence process because we have to get the industry started&mdash;and a firm date in March next year set for the standard, my advice from industry is that the effort will be put into getting this box. That will give at least the potential for an industry in Australia to export this digital PAL technology to the rest of the world. I support the amendment. </PARA>

They have six months to start the service. If they do not, that becomes&mdash;and these provisions are already in the Act&mdash;a breach of their licence provisions. Under the Act, if that happens, the ABA can issue them with a directive or a notice that they are in breach of their licence conditions and advise them what they have to do to get back into their licence. If they ignore that notice under section 142, there is a penalty of $2 million for being in breach of their licence conditions, which is a fairly stiff penalty, but other provisions of the Act also provide for continuing offences&mdash;that is, a daily offence. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there can quite justly be an expectation on the part of the people who now have those narrowcast licences that they will automatically be changed to broadcast licences once the satellite is up and running. We are looking for the absolute certainty that we will get the very best system. We believe that includes the ABC. We have said that all along and we still say it. I am referring to licence holder C on the satellite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once one of those licence holders on the satellite gets up and running&mdash;it does not have to be C; it could be A, B or C&mdash;the licences can be changed over. If the ABC is not the first up, that is up to the ABC, but it should be and I certainly recommend that it be the first. I imagine that this would happen long before 31 December&mdash;I have been told July is a reasonable starting date. The minute one of them gets up and running, the narrowcast licences are able to be changed over to broadcast licences. The current holders of narrowcast licences can then go out and get money and do deals on the reasonable expectation that they will get a broadcast licence when it is changed over, unless they are naughty people. If they are not naughty people, they will get it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe my understanding of commercial reality is different from that of others in this place. It seems to me that there is a world of difference between the two situations we are considering. In the first situation one actually has a licence in one's hand, having been granted by it the ABA based on TPC clearance, but one is restricted or governed by the start-up date of satellite services. In that situation we would say to an MDS licence holder, `You have been conducting narrowcast services already. We will look at your track record to date. We will take into account all the relevant criteria. We will grant you a licence now or in the next few months, but you cannot start up, conceivably until December of the following year'. I would have thought there was a much greater degree of comfort in that situation because one would have the certainty of knowing that one has one's licence. It has been approved and cleared but it cannot be used until a later, somewhat indeterminate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot to be said for the fixed start-up date because it reverses all the incentives. I think we would all acknowledge that. It has the great virtue of ensuring that those who get satellite licences in the next few months have a built-in incentive to agree on a system and start up as soon as they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what I found very interesting about the Minster's contribution was that he said that this will ensure that the satellite system will start before the other. In other words, this is a built-in legislative provision that ensures we will not have a common start-up date. Let us be clear about that. The Government is saying that the satellite service must be up and running&mdash;operational&mdash;before MDS, because we cannot even grant an MDS licence until the satellite service is up and running. So, by definition, the MDS service will not start until some time after the licence has been granted. That seems to me to be quite the opposite situation to what was put by those who have argued that this provides a common start-up date, that we are talking about technological neutrality and that on a certain particular date&mdash;which we cannot precisely identify; we can just put our provisions&mdash;we can ensure that both types of service  start  up  at  that  time,  if they choose to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot to be said for that. But that is precisely what the Minister is now saying is not the case. He is making it clear that the Government now wants to ensure that the satellite system will start before MDS, and he does that by delaying the grant of MDS licences until the satellite system is operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say to the Minister that that seems to me to provide a commercial disadvantage to the MDS licence holder. Even if we were to say, for example, that the MDS licence holder cannot start until three months after the satellite service is in place, we would have achieved our purpose of ensuring that the satellite system started before MDS but at the same time we would have given that MDS licence holder every opportunity to go out and raise funds in the marketplace on the basis of certainty. But there can be no certainty&mdash;there might be confidence&mdash;until the licence is actually granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because we obviously want to conclude these Bills tonight. I do not think that Senator Alston will argue with that. We have been over all the arguments. The purpose of this exercise tonight&mdash;whether Senator Alston agrees or disagrees with the detail of it&mdash;is to put in the certainty that we have to acknowledge, at least on the Government side, was left out last time around. That is why I am supporting these Democrat amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that there is the disadvantage that Senator Alston is talking about at all. Senator Bourne has laid out the facts and the current licence holders know these facts. Let us get down to tintacks. The TPC's role is only in respect of the anti-competitive&mdash;in other words, cross-media&mdash;sections of the TPC Act. One would not have to be a very smart MDS licence holder to very readily work out whether one was going to be in conflict or even come within a thousand miles of being in conflict with that. Personally, I do not know of any current ones that are. I think the TPC has publicly indicated that sort of thing in terms of who might be in trouble and who might not be. It is highly unlikely&mdash;in fact, outlandishly unlikely, as Senator Bourne has said&mdash;that they would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the only thing the licence holders have to worry about is the ABA scrutiny. The ABA scrutiny&mdash;Senator Bourne again says correctly&mdash;provides that only fit and proper people and so on will be allowed to be broadcasters. They themselves would know whether they are likely to be caught by that. The scenario Senator Bourne has laid out, a lot more clearly than I have, is correct; that is, that the licence holders themselves would know whether they were likely to fall foul of the TPC, and they would know whether they were likely to fall foul of the provisions of the ABA investigation. I am sure Senator Alston would know that that is not likely unless they had the kind of history that is alleged to be held by some people who have been in the news lately in terms of pornography and so on. They would then know that they would get these licences. This is a one-off start. It is important that the one-off start is clarified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Alston would probably agree, because we want to finish these Bills tonight. The Senate is sitting for the next couple of weeks. A report will be brought down in this house on a certain matter. Senator Alston knows full well that there will be endless opportunities to give me all the stick that the Senate believes I need to get. But all of us would agree that, rightly or wrongly, whether we disagree or agree with the provisions, we all want this matter finished and this legislation through tonight. I support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to raise a very serious concern that has been brought to my attention about racial discrimination in the Queensland Parliament by none less than the Premier of the Queensland Government, Mr Wayne Goss, and one of his Ministers, Mr Mackenroth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been absolutely disgusted to read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the constant, sometimes subtle&mdash;and of today's order not so subtle&mdash;racial slurs and attacks on the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Santo Santoro. Mr Santoro is of Italian descent&mdash;he was born in Sicily&mdash;but has been living in Australia for some 29 years. Mr Santoro is a highly-qualified person in his own right who has made his mark in his own right. He has not been given a leg-up by anybody. He has two degrees; one with honours. Yet this Queensland Government is prepared to attack him in a way which I think is absolutely and utterly appalling and degrading to all people of overseas origin. This Queensland Government is part of a labour movement throughout Australia that trumpets loud and strong about the benefits of anti-discrimination legislation, yet this Queensland Labor Government can make constant attacks on Mr Santoro. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make sure that the Senate understands exactly what has been happening up there. Mr Goss has made constant references to Mr Santoro's history. When speaking in the Legislative Assembly on 11 May, Mr Santoro said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, this is the beginning of an exercise by the Labor Party to deny our history. I do not know what Government members have against our history. We should be proud of it.</PARA>

Mr Santoro is a fine, respectable man. I have known Mr Santoro personally for some 15 years and I know that he is held in very high regard in Queensland, as he has been throughout Australia in the organisations with which he and I have been involved. I think this is a huge example of hypocrisy by the Goss Government. It also shows an enormous degree of ignorance and insensitivity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I very rarely speak in the adjournment debate. I do so tonight to correct a very serious charge which was laid against me today in the Senate by Senator O'Chee. In the current circumstances, the record does have to be corrected. Before I do that, I want to speak briefly on another matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently saw on television a very interesting profile of the famous American evangelist Billy Graham. I am a Catholic, not a Baptist. I want to relate an experience I had as a young person&mdash;I think I must have been only 10 or 12. I travelled by bus a very long way to hear Billy Graham speak at a Sydney stadium. That was a long time ago. I can still remember that night. Thousands of people were present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that because one thing really struck me right at the end of the interview, when the last question was asked. Whether we agree or disagree with Billy Graham's religion or position, it must be said that he has campaigned on a lot of moral issues throughout his life. I think he is in his seventies now. Right at the end of the interview, the interviewer said to him, `Dr Graham, if you had one choice, if you could push a button that would rid the world of what you believe is its worst feature in terms of things that disturb world peace and tranquillity, what would you push the button to rid the world of?'. I was sitting there thinking of heresy and all the rest of it. Billy Graham thought for a minute and said, `Well, if I had to push a button to rid the world of just one evil that I think the world would most benefit from, I would press the button to rid the world of racism'. And I agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the Senate today, Senator O'Chee alleged that I had lied to the Federal Court&mdash;apart from being disorderly, but I am not worrying about that&mdash;and had deliberately and blatantly misled the Senate, which is something I have never done, by claiming I had received written advice from Mr John Doherty that the MDS decision was lawful. This record must be corrected. I have said today&mdash;and I believe it to be true&mdash;that I do not think it is wise for politicians to discuss cases when they are currently before courts, particularly when the politicians concerned are the subject of the court action. These assertions&mdash;which were highly disorderly, apart from anything else&mdash;have to be corrected because they are not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee claimed that my statements to the court and to the Senate were in clear contradiction to written advice I received from Mr Doherty `on Thursday 28 January'. The advice was among the scores of documents lodged with the Federal Court. I said earlier that these documents are very much in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee's interpretation is entirely wrong on every single count. Read in the whole, Mr Doherty's advice says that I must not take any action which can be inferred as acting against the general principles of the Act&mdash;and I did not. Senator O'Chee is labouring under the misapprehension that I directed the ABA to act against the principles of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee claimed that he read the transcript provided to Senator Alston by this office. I have to say that he cannot have done so. Either that or he simply cannot understand the legal options set out in Mr Doherty's advice and how the advice relates to the Broadcasting Services Bill. That is one explanation; another is that he is deliberately misleading the Senate and the general public. I do not accuse him of that because I think, frankly, that he has not read the transcript&mdash;he couldn't have&mdash;and he certainly has not carefully read that written advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central point of the case which was put by Mr Horton QC for Mr Cosser was that there was something in the Broadcasting Services Bill that my decision deliberately subverted or tried to overcome by some sort of executive amendment to the statute. However, as Mr Heydon QC pointed out in his summing up, no statutory regime was enshrined in the Bill for the introduction of pay television. The summing up states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no word of phrase in the legislation which says anything about MDS licences being granted first.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is found on page 90 of the transcript. Mr Heydon said that Mr Cosser's counsel had submitted that my decision on 29 January meant satellite would come first and MDS second or third. My decision, however, meant that they would both be brought in at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My decision was taken to ensure that MDS did not threaten the viability of satellite pay, thereby robbing many people outside of major cities from receiving pay television. Most importantly in terms of the decision I took, the role of the ABC would also have been injured beyond doubt, something which this Senate specifically insisted in the Act should not happen&mdash;the ABC should have a role. That was under threat and that is principally why I took the decision I did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is entirely consistent with the principles of the Act which seek to promote the availability of the most diverse range of radio and television services to audiences around the country. It is in the objects of the Act. The Act also seeks to achieve a regulatory environment which will facilitate the development of a broadcasting industry which is efficient, competitive and responsive to audience needs. It was in my view entirely appropriate for me to take the actions I did in those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Federal Court was told, I was not seeking to change or suspend the law. I merely used the wide discretionary legal powers available to me to avoid what I saw as a situation which would disadvantage a large number of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee's troubles do not stop there in terms of the inaccuracies. I might add, the court transcript reveals how inaccurate his assertions are, so he cannot have read the court transcript. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, but I am quite happy for you to ring him up, but he might just get himself into more trouble. The document he read from was in fact advice electronically mailed to Roger Beale, Christine Goode and Rohan Buettel. If he has the advice, he should have a look at the top of it and see who it was addressed to. These people are officers of the department. It was never sent to me, never seen by me at all. It had no reason to be. It was internal departmental advice taken during the officers' construction of the tender process. I never saw it, nor should I have ever seen it. So the assertions that I received written advice are absolutely and blatantly untrue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that that was made clear during the court proceedings. If Senator O'Chee in making these serious charges&mdash;and they are damned serious&mdash;had read the transcript, he would have seen that because it is contained in the court transcript. Of course, he cheerfully ignored it. If one takes what he said on its face value that he read the transcript, one will come to the conclusion that he is either deliberately misleading the Senate on this matter&mdash;and I do not accuse him of that&mdash;or he has not read it very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told the Federal Court&mdash;it is in the transcript&mdash;that I never received written advice from Mr Doherty on these issues and never asked for written advice. That is correct; I never did. The advice was conveyed to me orally during the numerous phone conversations I had with senior departmental officers and my own advisers. Senator O'Chee should read that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over two days of telephone conferences, I received oral advice. These were telephone conferences with the department. Because I am in Darwin I actually have a conference facility in my office. It is a cheap one&mdash;it only costs $1,000 from Telecom but it is very good and I commend it. I often have telephone conferences and find, particularly when you are talking to people you know, that the extra vision from a teleconference does not add much to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had many of those telephone conferences over that couple of days in which officers from the department were involved. I point out an obvious fact that the officers of the legal section of the Department of Transport and Communications are specialists in communications law. The officers in my department and Mr Doherty were in fact the people who provided the drafting instructions for the Act that I was seeking advice on. So arguably they would know as much about it as anyone else. That written advice was never seen by me. The one piece of written advice I did get of course, its having been sent to me, was the advice which said, `You have the express powers', et cetera which I tabled this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another grave misinterpretation that has been placed on this&mdash;not just by Opposition members. Fair enough, they are entitled to have a go; I cannot complain. I had 10 years in Opposition, five as leader, and I had enough goes in my time and delivered enough flak to not complain about getting a bit back. That other grave misinterpretation has also been placed by members of the press gallery who have just jumped into this issue. This is not an issue one can jump into. It is so complex that anybody that just sits in front of the old keyboard and the visual display at a newspaper office and bashes out the story without having read at least 500 or 600 pages to get the story right is bound to make a mistake&mdash;and people have. People have read the departmental minutes, seen the assertions made that were referred to from the day before I took the decision and said, `You were told that this was not the way to go'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a simple and correct explanation for that. Many of the options then being discussed were options which I rejected and which in my view would have required amendments. As I mentioned in the Senate, one of the options being actively discussed, because all options were being considered, was to issue a direction to prescribe narrowcasting for pay only&mdash;in other words, to knock it out of the broadcast role completely in line with proposals that were put to me during the debate. So the option that I finally adopted was in fact not the option that many of these advices were referring to. But nobody has bothered to check that little fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee began his remarks by claiming that this debate was about decency, and that staggered me. I have to say again that I have no rigid views on sub judice matters. There are a lot of interpretations about sub judice and I do not think it should be applied narrowly, but I certainly do think it is not fair to expect a politician such as myself to canvass matters that are before a court when that politician is himself the subject of legal action. Potentially it is attacking a mute target. That is why I am saying that it is not fair. I might add that I do not think it is very sensible&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the simple reason that if people make free with the court transcript on a decision that has not yet been brought down, when part of the matter before the court is that I abused my public office in deliberately taking a decision that I knew not to be lawful&mdash;that is the charge the court is going to have to make a determination on; it is before the court&mdash;I do not think it is fair for people to set themselves up in here as judges and to run the transcript when sensibly I should not discuss it at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very unhappy and reluctant to have to discuss it now. But having effectively been accused of these very grave charges in a most disorderly way, I feel I have no obligation in that respect. I am very reluctant to do it and not because I am afraid of the truth. I make the obvious point that if I were afraid of the truth I would never have voluntarily gone to the Federal Court, sat in a box for three hours under cross-examination and given evidence on oath. It is the first time I have ever been cross-examined in a court in my life and I found it a very trying experience. Even though I have been in public life for 16 years, it is a different quantum to sit in the court and give evidence. It is very intimidating and I would not have done that if I had been afraid of the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what I am asking is for people, out of common decency, to stop canvassing these issues in here when they know I am the subject of a court action and cannot really reply to them properly, because the matter is currently before the court and a judgment has not been brought down. I do not think that is fair, particularly when that canvassing is grossly inaccurate and comes from people who could not sensibly make an assertion unless they had sat down and read the full 100 pages of the court transcript&mdash;which they clearly have not done&mdash;and all of the documents. If they had done that, and if Senator O'Chee had done that, I have to say with sweet reason to him, he would see that he was wrong and the grave charges that he has made against me in this Senate would be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If at the end of the day the court makes that decision, I hope that Senator O'Chee will consider that perhaps it was not wise to quote from court transcripts in a case that has not been heard when the subject, the person he is talking about, cannot really effectively and properly respond to him. I think it is neither very wise nor conducive to the system of justice that he does that. If Senator O'Chee would leave the legal theatrics to the professionals or the cast of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">LA Law</EMPHASIS>, I really must say that I think we would all be a lot better off. </PARA>

<TITLE>F3 Freeway</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="639" SPEAKER="Tierney Sen J.W." NAMEID="O15" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (11.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to bring to the attention of the Senate the continuing saga of the F3 Freeway, which is continuing because of the poor planning of the Federal ALP Government. The Federal Government has finally got around to allowing the next stage of the F3&mdash;the main northbound freeway out of Sydney&mdash;to connect to the New England Highway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous plan touted by the former Minister for Land Transport, Mr Bob Brown, was to end the F3 in the middle of a swamp, 8 kilometres short of a satisfactory intersection with the New England Highway. The Government's plan was then to carry the heavy traffic between Sydney and the north of New South Wales over that 8 kilometres of residential road called Lenaghans Drive. This will come into effect in December this year and it will last for at least two years. This of course is a ludicrous situation. It will result in bottlenecks for northbound traffic, particularly at Christmas time; it will result in serious traffic hazards and make life exceptionally uncomfortable for the residents of Lenaghans Drive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most amazing aspects of this saga is the fact that the additional traffic burden created on local roads due to the truncated freeway directly affects the Charlton electorate of the former Minister for Land Transport. But the new plan is only to build the northbound lanes of the new carriageway. All southbound traffic will continue to use Lenaghans Drive. This of course means that Lenaghans Drive becomes a one-way road which will create severe traffic problems for the residents of the area. For example, should a resident of Lenaghans Drive wish to visit someone who lives half a mile to the north on the other side of the road, that resident needs to get on the northbound carriageway of the F3, travel all the way out to Beresfield and then travel south again on Lenaghans Drive; this trip could be up to 16 kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, the safety problems have not been adequately addressed. A residential road which will be turned into a carriageway for one of Australia's major transport routes will be totally unsuitable for local traffic. The pedestrians and local traffic will be placed in danger, and this will be heightened by impatience and inconvenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, as the Senate can see, although the announcement to extend the F3 to connect with the New England Highway is to be welcomed, it is only half the solution to the Lenaghans Drive nightmare. It is expected to take over two years to complete the northbound lane to Beresfield and upgrade Lenaghans Drive as the southbound lane. Then, if time and funds permit, another carriageway will be built for the southbound traffic allowing Lenaghans Drive to revert to a local road. However, this extra carriageway is not expected for at least another 10 years. Given the history of the F3, which has been under construction now for 30 years, we probably will be waiting for the extra traffic lanes for about another 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, while all the earthworks are being done for the F3 northbound lane, the Government could also commence work on the southbound lane thus containing costs. What has happened is that this Federal ALP Government, which has the funding responsibility for the federal roads system, should immediately make money available and fully support the proper completion of the F3 Freeway. </PARA>
