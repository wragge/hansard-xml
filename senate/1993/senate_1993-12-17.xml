<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be opposing these clauses. The reason is that the bill, in these clauses, is increasing from two years to three years the period of notice that non-government schools need to give for changes and for proposals. This is too burdensome on non-government schools, and it is erecting yet another barrier that will hinder and, I think, prevent some non-government schools from being able to operate. This extra penalty being too burdensome, the Liberal and National parties wish to see this potential barrier removed from the bill. Accordingly, we are opposing these clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If no-one else is going to speak, I just want to say that the opposition is correct in saying that the period of notice is being extended. However, I believe that the minister's department discussed this with representatives of the non-government schools, and they have no objection to it. In fact, it brings the period of notice forward from February, when schools are busy with the start of the new year, to the previous October, when they are doing their forward planning in any case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other clauses cover things such as schools that start enrolling secondary students on a year-by-year basis rather than all at once. This is not a new idea, and it helps schools that are not in a position to open a complete level of education at once. Opposing these clauses does not upset the new schools policy, as the opposition apparently wishes to. They are basically for the efficient administration of an existing government policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then the minister would not mind telling the committee with whom, with which organisations, and with which independent schools this agreement took place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am perfectly well aware of the leverage that the government can exert over schools in order to obtain agreements. In this particular area of education, it has been shown time and time again that it can come to agreements from a position like that. Therefore, it is particularly the job of the Senate to examine objectively the measures such as this that are coming before us. I am inclined at this juncture at least to oppose the clauses as Senator Teague has suggested. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me rise very briefly to say that I also consult carefully with representatives of the Catholic systemic schools in the states. The Liberal and National parties want those schools to flourish. We want to see the whole spectrum of schools in this country able to manage their affairs and to have maximum autonomy and we want to allow the parents of Australia freedom of choice to see their children educated in the way in which each family determines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difference in operations between systemic schools. There is a flexibility for the central organisers of a system in each state to receive moneys and disperse moneys, to have their own rolling plans over quite a long period. I can understand that the systemic schools would see less objection in having to give the notice that is required by the government to be three years. However, it is not any surprise that that other group of non-government schools has not the same ability. They are the non-systemic schools that are more individual and more independent; they are dealing for the most part with only one school, not a range of schools in any one state. They have not as big a flywheel in continuous momentum. This additional time the government is proposing is a difficulty for them. It is in the light of the overall picture and the balance of how this would affect all non-government schools that we will oppose these clauses. I therefore acknowledge that a fair degree of what the minister has said is his feedback from systemic schools. We persist with our opposition to these clauses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty we have with these clauses and with the points of view that have been expressed, both by the coalition and by the minister, is that, as with many bodies that deal with government instrumentalities and policies, some representative bodies when I spoke to them seemed to have a very clear understanding of the new schools policy, its genesis, its process through this place and through the cabinet, and its development through the department. For anybody to have a full understanding of that is miraculous, but some of the representative bodies I spoke to seemed to have an understanding of it. There were other groups and individual schools that I spoke to which were merely confused and were not able to resolve their confusion simply by referring to what the government planned to do. There was a question of why: why should this be done; how will it affect us; what do we have to do now?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before coming here I had some experience in local government as an elected member. In the situation of a flywheel of planning that Senator Teague was describing, what I found was that established schools with established representative bodies&mdash;the ones that have been going for 100 years&mdash;knew how to deal with local government, planning requirements, filling out the forms when making application for an extension, where to put the toilets, whether the school oval had appropriate car parking and that sort of thing. The established schools were well aware of how to deal with that. Those which were new, more flexible and seeking to establish themselves were having great difficulty with local government and, of course, with Commonwealth government and with state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand and endorse the comments of Senator Teague about attempting to meet a need that is expressed through the community, which recognises failings in the government system and recognises special requirements of the non-government system&mdash;even perhaps failings of the non-government system&mdash;and seeking to address that by bringing to it an independent approach. In seeking to do that, communities of people are finding ever increasing barriers and difficulties. What is proposed here seems to be another one of those. It is very difficult to reach common ground in what should be done and how it should affect groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as we can see, the expression of opposition to this, while not universal, is well entrenched within both the established systems of non-government schools and the newer alternative, independent schools&mdash;some of which are perhaps even non-denominational. The opposition is not based entirely on confusion but is based on well-reasoned requirements to be flexible and to work on plans that apply to the rules as they stand. To change them in this way merely provides further barriers. So the Democrats will be joining with the coalition in the opposition of these clauses. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Clause 15, page 10, after proposed subsection 55(3), add the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(4) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a), a student is not to be taken as not attending school on a daily basis if on any day the student, while remaining enrolled at the school, is reasonably in attendance at another location for educational purposes or for educationally significant cultural purposes.".</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment relates to clause 15 and it is a genuine amendment in that it seeks to add a subsection. This is to remove any doubt that this bill would place on the number of enrolled students in any school, any doubt arising with regard to a student or students being absent from the actual school campus on an excursion or for any other legitimate school related reason. It is because that is in doubt and because schools have, in consultation with us, put the view that this non-sensible and impractical possibility of distorting the enrolled numbers could arise, that these additional words make it quite explicit. A student enrolled at the school, who happens to be absent for a day, or even two, on an excursion related to the school is still an enrolled student. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the amendment from the opposition. The purpose of our proposal, proposed new section 55(3)(a), is to place in legislation what was previously an administrative provision. The intention of the new clause is not that a student attend school every day before the school is eligible for Commonwealth general recurrent funding in respect of the student. What is necessary is that the student attend on a daily basis as opposed to a regular but infrequent basis such as once a month or once a term. A student who attends on a daily basis but is temporarily absent from the school would not be affected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed new section 55(3)(b) also allows the minister to exercise discretion in favour of students who would normally attend on a daily basis but are absent from school in special circumstances. The minister will use this discretion to formally cover the situation the opposition raised in the House of Representatives, that is, students absent from the school to attend TAFE receive special education, participate in school excursions and, in the case of Aboriginal students, participate in ceremonial occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator Teague that the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has considered the sorts of concerns raised by the opposition in examination of the bill and has expressed itself satisfied without dissent that the mechanisms for counting student enrolment numbers make provisions for such events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition amendment is imprecisely drafted; it could allow the school to receive funding for students who never actually attend the school at which they are enrolled or are infrequent attendees. It also has the effect of making what is `reasonably in attendance' in another location for educational purposes a question of law without providing any guidance as to the meaning of `reasonably'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of that information I ask Senator Teague to reconsider his amendment. I think he would understand that there is always pressure under funding arrangements, and if there is any suggestion that a school is taking an advantage by counting its numbers in a way which is not open and fully transparent to everybody, that can easily create division within the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my recollection, two or three years ago within the state school system of South Australia there were several controversial cases of principals being admonished by the education department for using a very liberal interpretation of the correct ways of counting enrollees so that they received extra staff in their allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That indicates to me as a lay person in this debate&mdash;this is not my area of ministerial responsibility, even in the Senate&mdash;that we should be very cautious about allowing a liberal interpretation by a minority of people, while those who play the game properly do not get the same advantage. I think that the honourable senator's amendment is unnecessary and that that is why the Senate standing committee expressed itself satisfied without dissent. With that information Senator Teague may now not proceed with the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Science and Small Business and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science (Senator Schacht) very sincerely for the assurances that he gives for what we would call a sensible definition of enrolment. I agree with the minister to the extent that we of course want to see transparency and we want to see proper accountability and very clear, universally consistent recognition of the way to count enrolments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will, nevertheless, persist with its amendment, because I do not believe that it is imprecisely worded. It is a very clear sentence. It makes it all the clearer in the legislation, by this amendment being added to it, that we are not putting in doubt those students who are reasonably in attendance at another location for educational purposes or for educationally significant cultural purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing that the minister said is in any way, in the government's intention, contradictory to what is meant by those words. Accordingly, to put this matter beyond doubt&mdash;and in the spirit of having these words and all the other parts of the bill consistently interpreted around Australia&mdash;the bill is improved by the opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats shared the concern of many people who were initially alarmed by what was proposed in the bill. To explore that concern, we sought assurances from the minister about the manner in which the discretion under this clause would be used. We received essentially the same advice that the Minister for Science and Small Business and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Science (Senator Schacht) has given us here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon reflection, it seems to me that there would be a number of particular circumstances which are not mentioned in the opposition's amendment which would need to be addressed and which would need discretion to consider. If it is appropriate for an Aboriginal person to be absent for a significant cultural purpose, and if that needs to be defined, then there may be many, many other cultural purposes which would need to be defined. Where would we stop? There could be bar mitzvahs and goodness knows what! I might have a difficulty in imagining the various significant cultural purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministerial discretion, of course, should be competent and capable of arriving at that conclusion. I would hate to try to define that here in legislation. With some experience of trying to work out full-time equivalents and enrolments&mdash;not, I hasten to add for the minister's benefit, within the attendance of the Democrats in this place&mdash;but in previous experience in educational administration, I spent some time trying to work out enrolment statistics for TAFE at one stage. A great deal of discretion is required for that sort of administration, and it would be wrong to attempt to remove or reduce that discretion. What is proposed in the bill&mdash;especially with the minister's assurance&mdash;is appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can give the Senate the assurance that, when I gave that information, it was an example. It is not limited to the Aboriginal community. I am advised that the process of the minister's discretion will be a public and transparent arrangement whereby people can put submissions to the minister and publicly find information about why the discretion has been used in certain ways. If there is a concern in the community about the use of the minister's discretion, then that will be publicly available to be debated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As foreshadowed during the second reading stage, the Democrats have had great concern about this particular proposal. The amount of evidence received during the committee of inquiry&mdash;the evidence that was put by the department&mdash;and the incredible amount of time invested in considering all aspects of this have led to a situation which is a considerable improvement upon that which we first understood to be applying. The improvement was caused by the fact that the Democrats indicated an unwillingness to support the government's proposal. That is the very purpose of this chamber&mdash;to consider legislative proposals and their effects and, having considered them, to indicate where this chamber is dissatisfied. The committee of inquiry was intended to identify what the problems were. The questions I asked were intended to determine what was wrong with CAP. I asked myself, `Why fix something that isn't broke?' That is the question that is often asked when government propositions come before us to suggest that a change is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers given to the committee were not satisfactory. The department was unable to demonstrate at that stage the need for change. Therefore, the next process was put in place whereby I was unable to sign the majority report, which contended that the legislation should proceed unchanged. That was probably the biggest tool that could be used on behalf of this chamber by the Democrats. We believe that that has forced a consideration and a great deal of negotiation to take place. That is what it is all about. There is no point in signing a minority report and then sitting on it. There is no point in expressing dissatisfaction with a legislative proposal and then saying, `Right, I have done my job'. The job then starts. To be satisfied simply by opposing something is to ignore the incredibly weighty responsibilities that come in this place. To oppose something and then say that that is good enough, that that will fix it, is to me naive in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work we then undertook was to ensure that the country areas program did maintain its integrity and was preserved. To characterise our position and the government's position, even worse, as a position which will&mdash;that is the word that has been used&mdash;dismantle the undoubtedly and demonstrably excellent CAP program is misleading in the extreme and is almost immoral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fears have been expressed by people who have been led to believe that such a threat exists. Those fears are real and they should concern us all. They certainly concern me. The motivation for our involvement in this debate is not just because it is there. The motivation for the involvement of the Democrats is that we believe that geographically isolated people, on the question of equity, should be able to access the same facilities and level of education that is available in urban Australia. By supporting the amendment, we will certainly not guarantee that equity of access. The government is proposing to ensure that the CAP continues to deliver educational opportunities and does not just spread money around in a way that has been properly criticised in some instances and does not offer the opportunity for proper evaluation of what it is achieving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A little has been said about the bush as a place where people suffer geographical isolation. As one who has to travel across the water to get to this place, I have some experience in isolation. I can tell the committee that there are places across the water from Tasmania that are particularly advantaged by the present application of the CAP funds. Those offshore islands from Tasmania are places that desperately need the sort of funding that is provided here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to add that I have considerable personal experience with the provision of education in places such as Hungerford. I actually administered a centre in Victoria, which was very closely involved with the CAP program at that time in the early 1980s. The idea that there are only a few people in here who know about this because they talk about the bush a lot is an idea that should be discounted very quickly. We all have access to information and to people who tell us how valuable the CAP program is. I think it is very misleading to characterise this legislation as legislation that will discontinue this program. It is misleading for people to contact us and say that the CAP will no longer apply in their area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The path we followed to find out whether this was the case is a path that leads us to believe that the state ministers, whether or not they be of the same political persuasion as this government, have considered this long and hard. I did refer to some agreements that were in draft and some agreements that have been signed and some agreements that are almost ready to be signed between the Commonwealth and the state ministers. These guarantee the delivery of CAP programs. In the second reading stage I referred to them in particular and quoted from parts that require that the state governments deliver. In those circumstances, I cannot see how anybody can honestly come in here and say that the CAP program will stop unless this amendment is agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the claims is that `broadbanding does not require states to develop structures to encourage or protect the best practices learned under the existing CAP structure'. That is an assertion which has been common to a lot of the correspondence that we have received, and the person who wrote that was fearful of the continuation of the CAP program. I am sorry that that person does not have access to the agreements that I quoted. These are agreements which are in the process of being signed and there are a growing number which have been signed. I have only five in my possession but there are others, I understand. They do precisely what it is claimed here that they do not do, and I am sorry that the person who wrote this could not have had access to the content of these agreements. If that person had had that access, he or she would have understood that it is precisely that that is being guaranteed by these agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot fly in the face of such agreements. I cannot deny the existence of them. They are here, they are tangible and they are at the level of state government to Commonwealth government. They are also at the level of other state systems such as the Independent Schools Board National Equity Program Authority Inc. and the Queensland Catholic Education Commission. What I am saying here is that bodies which have it within their responsibility to deliver these programs are now in the process of making agreements with the Commonwealth to guarantee the continuation, and that is a tangible process which neither I nor nobody else, I suggest, can deny the existence of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that it is all doomed because of an increased requirement for evaluation and an increased supervision from the Commonwealth and a regulation of the system, to suggest that that will by definition lead to decline and deterioration, is a very strange path to follow. When there was insufficient evidence, when there was a lack of evidence, as was the case in the committee of inquiry, I was concerned and expressed my concern at that stage through the minority report, the dissenting report. But since then the considerable amount of work that has been done has revealed the evidence which I have referred to several times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the time, it is not appropriate for me to speak for long, but I will say that it seems to me that the proposition that has been put forward by Senator Bell could quite adequately be put forward if he were to vote with the opposition and maintain the CAP structure. I am not really prepared, as a senator representing the state of Tasmania, to just simply leave this in the hands of the agreements between the state and the Commonwealth. Because the Commonwealth has got money and has got the whip hand, it can get the states to sign anything. We know that. Getting particularly to the point Senator Bell made, I want to refer to a letter addressed to me personally. I am sure that the person would not mind. It is from the Mitta Murray Country Education Project, and it says this in paragraph 2:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian State Government's decision to dispense the CAP funds to individual schools as part of their push to self-managing schools causes concern in many of our rural communities. While existing structures can always be improved, to allow the States to dispense with a system that includes processes and incentives for clustering is an extremely retrograde step. Just giving money to an isolated school does not overcome isolation. In fact it can make schools more isolated. Isolation is not overcome by spending say a $3,000 grant just on books or a computer, in the same way that these items reduce socioeconomic disadvantage as in the DSP program. However, schools working and planning together, sharing joint programs, working with their communities and accessing ideas and information from other parts of the State does help address isolation issues. `Broad banding' does not require States to develop structures to encourage or protect the best practices learnt under the existing CAP structure.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. I think it is a very important illustrative factor. We can all stand here and talk about the bush. I went to a bush school&mdash;and probably that shows at times.

<PARA>The minister may be able to elaborate on this, but I think that is precisely why I do not have before me an agreement with the Victorian state government. It is the Victorian state government's propositions which would not be supported in an agreement because of the style of agreement which is necessary. I quote from another agreement I have, under the heading `Priority country area component':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schools in declared country areas are the only schools eligible for PCAP funds.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a school in an urban area would not be able to access PCAP funds. That is the accusation that is made time and time again to support the case that is being put by the coalition&mdash;that they will be drained off to a more streetwise, shall we say, submission group from an inner urban area which may demonstrate disadvantage. That disadvantage may well be there, but it is not disadvantage through isolation. It is the disadvantage through isolation being addressed through the CAP funds that is being treated by those people who are receiving it; and they want to keep it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schools in declared country areas are the only schools eligible for PCAP funds. That is the basis of an agreement; that is where it starts and it continues. These schools apply for funds through submissions. Submissions are assessed at local area cluster committees which may also apply for funds for the cluster through submissions. Declared country areas in this particular agreement are regionalised into four areas; management committees in the four areas assess submissions from clusters and approve grants. Area committees may also allocate notional amounts for cluster committees. The state management committee oversees the operation at the area committees and meets three to four times a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment there are no such safeguards. At the moment there are no such regulations covering how it will be done. At the moment there has been some evidence&mdash;I do not want to dwell on this because that is not the important point&mdash;that the intention of the PCAP to provide for education needs is in fact being avoided to some extent, and the needs that are being met are community needs. I will not elaborate there because that is not the point of the argument; it does not really matter. The improvement as I see it is an improvement in regulation and certainty that the PCAP funds will be used by rural schools. They will meet educational needs and they will be evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the evaluation process is most suspect. The same letter that Senator Harradine quoted from said that this year around $300,000 was hived off for a gender equity program but for next year about $400,000 has been allocated. Fluidity benefits some, but generally not all, students in rural areas. It is precisely for that reason that I think evaluation should be tighter and agreements should be signed. Senator Harradine is right. The Commonwealth has got the money; it can make the states sign anything and I am convinced that it should. It should. I believe the criticism contained in the same letter Senator Harradine referred to illustrates why we need to make sure that the PCAP program stays, but that it is properly evaluated and agreements for its delivery are entered into. </PARA>

The opposition apparently wants to amend this bill in the belief that geographically isolated students will somehow be disadvantaged by its provisions. The flexibility of broadbanding in no way diminishes the rights of rural and isolated children to Commonwealth equity funding. The reality is that it will allow funds to be much more effectively targeted to the most needy students&mdash;those who are both poor and isolated, including Aboriginal students.

The wording of the proposal does not achieve this intention. It prohibits conditions which require the authority to apply country area funds to other than geographically isolated students.

As I remarked earlier, these proposals by the government will mean that this parliament, this chamber, will be able to have a better monitoring role in looking at the evaluation of the effectiveness of these programs and how the money is spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought one of the areas that everybody in the Senate seems to agree on is that it should be a role of the Senate, through the estimates committees, to argue about effective evaluation of government expenditure. Here we are putting in these proposals, for the first time under this broadbanding arrangement, that effective evaluation that is more open and more transparent. I should have thought all of us would welcome that, particularly members of the opposition, because it gives them the chance to raise these issues in estimates committees and in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the proposal before us is an excellent step forward in getting a more open and transparent outcome that improves the ability of isolated and disadvantaged children, whether they are in the city or in the country, to be better served by this program; and we are all able to see the effectiveness of those programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a person who, like Senator Harradine, spent most of my childhood and teenage years growing up in a country area, I am more than sympathetic to the view that rural areas have special circumstances in isolation that have to be addressed by a national government to ensure that, in terms of equity, children in rural areas get the same access to decent education as those in the city. That always has to be the bottom line of a national government with a national objective of equity. Therefore, I think that the proposal on broadbanding goes a long way to improving that outcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a very difficult decision for the Greens. Basically, it is an issue of responsiveness versus safeguards. There is a need for states to be more responsive to filling communities' needs. The government has the right motive but probably the wrong thinking. It thinks the states are closer to the communities than is the Commonwealth for decision making. It will be interesting to replay during the Mabo debate some of these arguments between the coalition and the Labor Party. It seems quite extraordinary; but fine, the government should not usurp community decision making to meet its ends, which seems to defeat the purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we are concerned about the safeguards; we want to make sure that they are responsive to communities for DSP and CAP ratios. A parent, teacher or school council voicing opposition can take it up with the state DEET. The only way a minister can overturn it is if they can prove the states do not have satisfactory arrangements in place. If the structure is in place, it would be very difficult for that program to be adjusted. If DEET can back its decision with statistics, then it is in the clear. On the whole, it has been a difficult decision but, in the final analysis, we have decided to support the opposition's amendment, and the status quo, in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must reiterate that the Democrats have come to this conclusion because we asked the very same questions Senator Margetts asked and found that, at present, those safeguards do not exist. That is what this legislation is proposing. We support it because it guarantees the continuation of the PCAP's aims. For somebody to conduct a campaign around Australia which says, `PCAP is threatened, it is going to stop; vote against it', is so simple, so primitive, so crude and so wrong. We investigated those claims. We found them to be dishonest, misleading and thoroughly to be condemned, because they have alarmed country people throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have been associated with this sort of business at the receiving end, at the administrative end, and at the representative end, and I treasure what the PCAP is giving to Australian students. To say that it is threatened and that it is going to stop has alarmed and frightened so many people around this country that the campaign has worked. Those campaigners ought to be jolly well proud of themselves to have achieved that fear. What it has delivered is a stop to any chance of properly evaluating this program to ensure that what it is trying to deliver gets delivered. The faults Senator Harradine described in the famous letter that we have now had incorporated, where one state government is able to hive off $300,000 to an unassociated program, should stop. That is what we are trying to do. Putting this unfounded fear into people, suggesting that they ought to preserve a system which allows $300,000 to be taken from them and suggesting that that ought to be continued, is stupidity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to express my deep concern that this proposition by the government might not be supported by the committee because it fundamentally goes to the issue of accountability. It fundamentally goes to the issue of substitution. Those who are concerned about a national equity program have to be concerned about the capacity of state governments to transfer resources away from people who need them to people whom they believe, for political purposes, should get them. What this government proposal does is, for the first time, to provide a mechanism whereby there can be accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia today so-called joint programs for national equity consist entirely of Commonwealth money. This proposal by the government allows for the documentation of state inputs. The Commonwealth does not currently have that power in the present arrangements. It provides an opportunity to hold state politicians accountable for where they are allocating money. It undermines fundamentally those attacks upon equity programs by reactionary forces in Victoria who have closed 141 rural schools and we have not heard a word about that. We have heard great concern expressed about rural communities, but we have not seen any protest about what has been happening in terms of the on-the-ground situation. This government proposal advances equity, and the proposals that the opposition have presented in this place reinforce inequity. </PARA>

I have been advised, for example, that under the program in Queensland $17,000 was spent on providing floodlights for a polo field.

I have pointed out in the Senate on a number of occasions, as the minister representing Mrs Kelly in the Senate, there are letters from honourable senators opposite supporting the allocation of funds for those particular projects and supporting community funds. The evaluation of these programs is very important. If it is true that $17,000 was spent on floodlights for a polo field in Queensland under the CAP program, I think that is a reasonable question that ought to be looked at and evaluated. I would think that Senator Tierney, with his interest and background in education, would, like me, at least want to find out the justification for that grant. Questions are asked endlessly about such matters in the estimates committees, and I fully support that process. It has to be open and transparent.</PARA></TALK.START>

As a result, we will call a division on this and we may come back to the committee in the next day or so as a result of the decision that, I suspect, unfortunately the committee is about to make</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not support this innovation. It is undesirable. It is objected to by non-government schools. It will force independent schools to act as if they are a system, not individual schools. They have to be a part of some authority to which they will have to be very responding because that will be the authority that will distribute moneys from the taxpayer to those individual schools. The minister himself, by this innovation, would be avoiding having to make decisions about allocating funds to individual schools by handing that task over to a nominated body. We believe this task should remain with the minister and that the minister should be, in the normal way, accountable to the parliament and to the community for decisions about these allocations of moneys. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RE: STATE GRANTS (PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write on behalf of the Association to request that you give consideration to moving amendments to the above Bill, to ensure that the Minister retains responsibility for the National Equity Program (NEPS) funding decisions relating to Victorian independent schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed sub-sections 67A(2), 67A(3), 67A(6), 69A(2) and 69A(7) dealing with Special Education programs, preserve the option for the Minister to make a determination approving funding for schools as distinct from the nominated authority. However, the proposed sub-sections 6(4) and 71A(2)&mdash;Disadvantaged Schools Program, 65A(2) and 65B(2) and 65B(2)&mdash;ESL, 72B(2)&mdash;Country Areas Program, and 68A(2)&mdash;Intervention Support, totally preclude leaving the final decision with the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These subsections require amendments similar to the wording in the subsections relating to Special Education programs. A non legal summary of amendments is attached as a guide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for seeking this amendment goes to the heart of the democratic process. Without this amendment the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, as an elected member of the Federal Government, absolves himself of his responsibility for management and decision making over taxpayers' funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the words of DEET staff, the purpose of the amendments is to ensure that "there is no scope for blaming the Minister for decisions". That blame will be shifted to "nominated authorities" such as AISV, a voluntary user pay service organisation for Victorian independent schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to note that the Federal Minister retains decision-making power in relation to the National Students at Risk Program because again according to Department of Employment Education and Training staff, this is a program of significance. In light of the Discussion Paper and the White Paper on Employment Opportunities to be released in December 1993 and June 1994 respectively, it would appear that the Minister wants to be associated with these decisions, but not with others affecting, students in the Disadvantaged Schools, Country Education, English as a Second Language and other programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AISV notes your Party's concern about the broad banding approach to targeted programs such as the Country Areas Program and Disadvantaged Schools Program and your intention to seek amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AISV believes that unless the above amendments are introduced, the Federal Minister has the capacity to further remove himself from public and parliamentary scrutiny and more seriously to exercise Ministerial discretion and political expediency by transferring funds from programs such as CAP and DSP to the National STAR Program, at the time of the release of the Employment Opportunities papers. The recent Parliamentary debate over sports grants highlights the importance of Ministerial accountability for public funding and the need for the amendments AISV requests.</PARA>

It is probably an interesting observation about people who are not willing, when the crunch is on, to devolve authority, to give some authority back to the grassroots of education, to those actually administering NEPS and taking that responsibility. Of course, even under what we are proposing, the minister would still be ultimately responsible if people were complaining about what was going on. That would be an open and transparent process.

Rather, let us adopt a proposal such as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has put, such as the opposition has put, such as we put at the last election, that would open the doors for these extra enrolments and not deny any Australian access to enrolling in a university.

While enthusiastically supporting the notion of removing barriers to participation in higher education, Senator Teague has identified the very next step the coalition needs to take to arrive at true enlightenment in education policies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us take it one by one. I was a strong proponent of HECS because I believe that, until it is shown that everybody in the community is going to have access to higher education, those who have access to it, such as Senator Teague and I, should make some contribution. I think we have pointed out that students will not have to pay up front. In no case will any of the students cited by the opposition as being disadvantaged be required to pay up front. If they overcome the claimed disadvantage and attain average salary or above, they will be required to pay double HECS. There will also be exemptions to certain students, including students who acquire a disability after they have completed their first qualification and who are required to retain it in order to change their field of employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, migrants with overseas qualifications not recognised as being equivalent will not be charged double HECS. Also, students in combined or double degree courses will not pay double HECS. In conclusion, I point out that this obviously has revenue implications. Therefore, although every other party in the committee has indicated its opposition, we will still be calling a division. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, full fees were not. I thank the minister for that interjection. Let me hit that right on the head straight away, particularly as far as his colleague in the electorate of Robertson is concerned. At a public meeting in Gosford, the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) made the most outrageous statements and lied about the opposition's position in front of an audience of 660 Catholic parents. They had to be refuted at that spot. At no point was that our policy. Those misrepresentations around the countryside were just part of the Labor Party's campaign of lies which helped it get into government this time on a very misleading sort of campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no point did we support doubling HECS. I search in vain through the ALP policy of that time to find any whisper or any mention of even increasing HECS at all, let alone doubling it in one hit to probably some of the most disadvantaged groups in the community, who are the ones being hit with this proposal. One would wonder why the government is doing it. It is going to raise $10 million a year, which is hardly a huge amount of money in a $4 billion budget. Why a party that is supposed to be about social justice, about access and equity, would hit the groups that really need access and equity is totally beyond me at this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government stands condemned with the student community for doing this. Let me assure the minister that, in the run-up to the next election, aided and abetted by the Democrats, we will be pointing out to the student groups around this country that they cannot trust a Labor government; they should not believe anything it says in its policy. It lied to students last time. It was duplicitous, and it will be this time. The Labor Party has given us a great opportunity to give it a big serve in the next election. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments have the effect of altering the government's proposal to increase the rate of taxation repayment of the HECS debt and also lowering the income threshold at which that repayment begins. Although this argument has been rehearsed, and it was mentioned clearly in the second reading debate, I note that it is indicative of the approach the government has taken to those who study at tertiary level. The approach is that it is a personal benefit that is derived and that those who are engaging in study have to pay for it because it is their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' attitude and approach to this is that the community benefits greatly. Those who are able, and have the capacity to study at that level, do their country a great service by giving up their time and foreshortening their careers by continuing to study and develop fully their particular talents. The community as a whole benefits directly, indirectly, in the short term and in the long term from investing in the education of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an effect that is not apparent to some people in decision making areas. This is an effect that some people find it hard to come to grips with because they cannot see the cash money benefit; they cannot see the community flow-on as easily as they can when somebody cuts down a tree and says, `There is an export; we can make a dollar out of it'. The effect was illustrated recently when we had the little fiasco with regard to Malaysian trade. There was a threat to Malaysia's participation in Australia's education system, for which Malaysian students are paying. The multimillion dollar purchase of Australian education by Malaysian students was identified while that little fiasco was taking place, and that purchase was identified as an immediate, direct, export benefit for Australia. Because of that, there has been an increase in community appreciation of the tangible value of a good education system and of proper investment in education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is now a little easier to make that we should not penalise those who develop their given talents to the fullest extent. We should encourage them because it brings community benefit. Because that point is a little easier to make, I have moved this block of amendments in the wistful hope that the government will recognise that its proposals are penalising that participation and that the Democrats' proposals would reduce that penalty and encourage people to participate. </PARA>

It is for these reasons&mdash;it is now a settled consensus by an overwhelming majority in the parliament&mdash;that we reject the Democrats' amendments with regard to the whole idea of HECS. Of course, that is the way Senator Bell would put it&mdash;`the whole idea of HECS'. We respect his minority views, but they are not acceptable to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise one additional matter. I refer to my colleague the Liberal member for Sturt, Mr Chris Pyne, who is the youngest member of the parliament and not far away from having been a student himself. He is one of the few in this parliament to have actually paid HECS. This good new Liberal member for Sturt has in our party discussions contributed an argument that I wish to refer to, that is, that the government has without warning, without including it in the election campaign, increased the rate of repayment of HECS for the students of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is after consultation with students that the member for Sturt objects to that in principle. He has been able to put his views, and it has been a matter of judgment within the Liberal and National parties whether or not the government's initiative to increase the rate of payment on the students of Australia unilaterally and without warning&mdash;a one-sided contract where the government has all the signatures&mdash;is a fair thing in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some months ago, when Mr Pyne put that view, it was Senator Bell who moved a motion in this chamber congratulating Mr Pyne and urging that that be the view taken by all honourable senators. I do not imply that Senator Bell was wishing to embarrass the honourable member for Sturt because his views did not eventually prevail within my parties, but I want to recognise that this is the kind of consultation with students, with vice-chancellors and with all the education industry, all education institutions, we commend. There is no embarrassment, only plaudits, for Liberal members such as Mr Pyne and the consultation he takes on matters such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not what the Liberal and National parties would have done in government. This is a decision that has been taken by the Labor government. It is the elected government. This is an integral and substantial part of the budget, and we traditionally allow the elected government its budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government has deceived the students of Australia by not only doubling HECS for some students, wanting to put a one-and-a-half times HECS on other students and increasing the rates of repayments of students, when none of these proposals, all of which were in the budget, was in any way referred to by the Labor Party prior to the last election. Rather, government members went around the campuses of Australia scaring students into not supporting the Liberal and National parties by putting forward the lie that we would introduce full fees for all students. It was a lie; it remains a lie. They scared a lot of students into supporting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it be understood that we have not gone back on anything we have said prior to an election. We were honest in the election. The Labor Party was not honest. The Labor Party has deceived the students of Australia. It is on the Labor Party's head that the matters that are before us right now are being placed upon the students of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the letter I received this week from the National President of the National Union of Students. Mr Ken Fowlie wrote to my colleague Dr Michael Wooldridge, and in this letter he made five requests. He asked whether, in this final debate in the Senate, the Liberal and National parties would seek to achieve those five objectives. All I can say is that every one of those objectives has been achieved by our votes today. I think the National Union of Students should read every word of these education debates and students should judge for themselves that the Labor Party has been the deceiver of the students of Australia. If they want an honest broker, if they want a policy that will increase participation in our universities for those who are currently missing out, the way to do that is through the policies we put forward honestly before the last election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The running sheet for this committee stage confuses me a little, but I know what I am moving at the moment and I think the committee understands what I am moving at the moment. It is important that I remind the committee that we are considering a block of amendments that oppose the government's intention to increase the rate of repayment of HECS and to decrease the threshold of income at which those repayments begin. Senator Teague made considerable play of the fact that the coalition was opposed to that trend. In fact, the first part of Senator Teague's speech addressed the Democrats' philosophy that HECS payments in general ought to be opposed. I do not deny that, and I do not deny his party's position. What I do find very strange is that, having said that, Senator Teague then spent some time congratulating the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) on his opposition to any change in the rate of repayment and the time at which repayments ought to start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague spent a considerable amount of time addressing the fact that the government did not refer to this new impost, this alteration to the HECS situation, in the lead-up to the election. If Senator Teague does endorse HECS as well-established&mdash;I forget the actual words, but the impression was a consolidated approach&mdash;and if he endorses the status quo of circumstances which govern this scheme, then why deny the passage of amendments that seek to remove the changes? If Senator Teague supports what the government has done in the past with HECS, why support its changes? Why oppose the honourable member for Sturt, who eloquently argued that the government had betrayed students? Why does Senator Teague not support his own party member, whom he lauded in this place not five minutes ago? Why is he opposing his well-founded criticisms of the government's plans to change HECS to increase the penalty on students?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept Senator Teague's interjection because that was the point of his contribution from that point on. If it is appropriate to oppose double HECS, if it is appropriate to make other changes, this minuscule fiddling about at the edges, which has an immeasurably small effect on the government's budget, has a huge effect on those people to whom it applies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excuse Senator Teague has given that the government has the right to expect the major direction of its budget is one that is shared by Senator Kernot and the Democrats. Senator Kernot expressed it very well on our behalf and achieved that. Within days of the budget we guaranteed the government the thrust of its intentions. This fiddling little amendment has a minuscule effect on the government's overall budget strategies. It is very difficult to remain consistent with the argument that it is important to change double HECS, an argument I congratulate the coalition upon. I cannot see that it can say that it is important to oppose that and yet not important to oppose this one, especially when so much time is spent congratulating the honourable member for Sturt for pointing out the inequities this proposal could bring to individuals. I think it is the height of hypocrisy to say that one aspect is worth opposing and the other one is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made; the argument has been run. I think it is very important that those people whom Senator Teague implored to read every word of this debate do so, because the words reveal quite readily what the problem is. The problem is one of picking and choosing which aspect will be easily understood and easily saleable. Double HECS is a phrase which has readily gained currency in the lines of student opposition. It is the sort of line that is easy to deliver at a street rally; it is the sort of concept that is easily saleable in a campaigning sense. Try describing this one. One look at the amendments is enough to put off anybody trying to explain exactly what is being achieved. We know. It is not easy to sell, and so it is not a particularly attractive amendment to agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it simply, we are opposing the government's sleight of hand, the government's intention to increase the rate of HECS repayments and to reduce the threshold at which those repayments begin. I implore the coalition to see the sense of that. I implore it to recognise the consistency in doing that and in opposing the double HECS, and the consistency in doing that and in agreeing with the oft quoted honourable member for Sturt, the youngest Liberal member of parliament. He had his moment of glory at a student rally in Adelaide which I attended. He received the accolades of the students listening to him until it was realised that, even though he was wise for his years, he might not carry the clout to get through the very changes that ought to be got through shadow cabinet and the coalition. The students there were sceptical of his chances, and their scepticism was rightly observed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scepticism was similarly applied to the Labor member for Bass, with whom I also participated in a debate on a student campus. The honourable member for Bass, Silvia Smith, said in so many words before the budget that it would not happen because she did not think it would happen; the changes were not official; she did not know anything about them and therefore the students should not be worried. They knew what was going on; they knew what was proposed; they were ready for it; they were opposed to it; they wanted something done about it. But the emu mentality prevailed, and here we have the government proposing to increase the rate and decrease the threshold. I think it is very important that students read this debate and realise that they were conned before the election and they were conned after the election. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As one of the two permanent delegates from Australia who has recently participated in the 90th conference of the Interparliamentary Union held in Canberra, it is a pleasure to make some comment on what was a unique and historical conference from Australia's point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was historical for Australia because although it was the 90th conference of the I.P.U., it was the first time that it had ever been hosted in Australia. There is no doubt that this gave Australia an ideal opportunity to not only reinforce its leading position on the I.P.U., but also to give the delegates from some 95 countries the opportunity to see our national capital in all its splendour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say it has made me very proud to hear comments that have been passed on to me by delegates since the conference praising not only the organisation of the conference, but praising Australia and Canberra in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conference as the report shows, concentrated on many areas, but it would be fair to say that the major topic was the unfortunate conflict that is occurring in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The former Yugoslav crisis was the major topic not only in the plenary sessions, but also at the committee meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resolutions pertaining to the external displacement of refugees in former Yugoslavia and other wars and civil wars were adopted and as the new delegate from Australia, I was astounded at the toing and froing and negotiating between countries to come up with agreeable forms of words.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But with the disasters that are occurring in this conflict it was no surprise that another resolution relating to respect for international humanitarian law and support for humanitarian action in armed conflicts was adopted by the conference. This motion was also as a result of the aforementioned conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another topic that received a fair amount of attention was a resolution concerning the health and wellbeing of the elderly. This was rather topical as we all know the health and wellbeing of the elderly is a matter of great concern within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a general debate on the political, economic and social situation in the world and I was pleased to have had the opportunity to speak on the importance of Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 90th conference saw the retirement of one of our permanent delegates, Mrs Kathy Sullivan and I must say this parliament owes her a great debt of gratitude for the tireless efforts she has put in on behalf of Australia at I.P.U. conferences over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was very proud of my colleague and the way she was received by her friends from many countries around the world and as an Australian politician, it was very gratifying to hear the glowing comments which were made about her efforts by other politicians from around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also appropriate that I make comment on the excellent contribution of our other permanent delegate and executive member of the I.P.U., Mr Leo Macleay. There is no doubt that the efforts of Mr Macleay and Mrs Sullivan over the years have lifted Australia's profile in the I.P.U. organisation to a very high level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was unfortunate that during the conference the dozens of countries represented were mainly occupied with the rightful concerns of us all concerning the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the same time, little did we realise that a tragic conflict was also being played out in Angola.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret Mr President, that this matter was not discussed at the conference because there was a delegation there from Angola, but I believe the vast majority of delegates from all around the world would have wanted to make their concerns known about the tragic loss of life and destruction being caused by the internal conflict in Angola. It was only a few weeks after the conference that we in Australia learned of the tragic events that have been happening there. No doubt at the 91st conference being held in Paris in March next year, the Angolan situation will be discussed at length.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report that is being presented today is a very good record of the conference and contains many of the major speeches that were made. I was very pleased to see the prominence at the conference of women parliamentarians and in fact, they have their own conference to discuss matters of concern to women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Topics such as the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and the international year of the family were discussed at some length.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact 67 women parliamentarians from 50 countries took part in a one day meeting of women parliamentarians and this was chaired by our representative, Mrs Kathy Sullivan. May I congratulate Mr. Geir Haarde from Iceland on his re-election as chairman of the twelve plus group. The Twelve Plus group plays a very important part as does the Asia Pacific group in regional matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another significant speech was the report by the honourable Andrew Peacock M.P. on the I.P.U. mission to observe the recent elections in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there is no doubt that the International Parliamentary Union plays a significant role in international affairs and one of the major side benefits from these conferences are the friendships and acquaintances one makes amongst countries from all around the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conference in Canberra was attended by 415 parliamentarians from 95 countries representing many different religions and cultures and many different political views. Countries large and small were all represented and it was a magnificent spectacle to see all delegates seated in the Great Hall during the plenary sessions. I believe it was most unfortunate that the members of the press gallery only two floors above paid little or no attention to what was happening below them two floors down.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have vivid memories of the delegate from Kuwait making a very strong speech about the invasion of their country by Iraq and whilst this was happening, the Iraqi delegate was pounding the table with his nameplate. It was shades of Kruschev in the United Nations in the 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The social events which were held in conjunction with the conference were exceptional and in particular, the gala concert held at the Canberra Entertainment Centre was of world standard. In fact I believe it will be televised around the entire nation on Australia Day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, may I once again congratulate all those hardworking staff members who worked so hard and made this conference such a successful one. Special thanks must go to the conference co-ordination unit that was so ably led by Ms Anne Hazleton and to all those other members of staff whether they be attendants, whether they be from Joint House, Sound and Vision, Department of the Library or wherever, they were a wonderful team and produced a memorable conference.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill and the Overseas Students Tuition Assurance Levy Bill are the final education-related bills before the Senate this session. The levy bill is a brief one-page bill that is entirely contingent on and interrelated with the first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills, which regulate education services for overseas students, follow a basic bill adopted a couple of years ago when, unfortunately, there was a collapse of a number of private colleges in Australia that were giving tuition to overseas students, mainly from China but also from other places. Because of discontinuities in expected enrolments and other matters very much related to that period, there was a collapse of colleges, which put Australia in a fairly bad light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate about this whole matter has been whether the government's attempts to give regulation so that this would not happen again, so that this would not reflect upon Australia, are excessive or just right.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the earlier debate, the matter having been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, some 29 substantial amendments were brought forward that moderated the degree of regulation the government was proposing. That is the case again. We have had one college in Western Australia collapse and, as a result, the government has brought forward this amendment bill, which will, in the government's mind, strengthen the regulations still further with regard to education services for overseas students, the registration of providers and the financial regulation of those colleges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole matter has been, as on the earlier occasion, referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. The committee, which includes my colleagues Senator Tierney and Senator Bell, and the chairman, Senator Zakharov, from the government, has given the matter very careful consideration and consulted with the industry involved. I am moved considerably by the findings of the committee, which are unanimous. The import of the findings particularly struck me in the second to last paragraph on page nine, where the unanimous view of the committee is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee reserves its judgment on the matter until such time as a more definitive proposal is forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter that is referred to by the committee, unanimously, is what is called the tuition assurance scheme. The concept is a good one. Where there is a failure of a college to provide completion of the delivery of a course to students, the other colleges that are part of the scheme will enrol the students and give them, as close as possible to the original course, a completion of the course for which they were originally enrolled. This is, therefore, tuition assurance, and the way in which this would operate would be called a tuition assurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point the Senate committee makes is that we have not any kind of description as to how this would work. We do not have any regulations that would be built upon the government's devising how this would work. The regulations will come after. The main bill that is before us has in clause 8, a substantial clause, the reference that to a tuition assurance scheme. The second bill is a levy bill to raise the moneys to make this provision for tuition assurance. I share the same doubts and the same anxieties as in the unanimous finding of the Senate committee. Accordingly, the opposition will be moving amendments. The amendments are in a form which is an alternative to opposing the levy bill and opposing clause 8 in the ESOS bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who first look at this, particularly those in the industry whom it directly concerns, say that the government has not got anything worked out on this matter. So the first reaction is to knock out clause 8 of the main bill and allow the other improvements to ESOS to stand and knock out the whole levy bill. The alternative to that is a little more sophisticated and, to us, convincing. It gives a way ahead to the government, to a degree. That is, we are saying that clause 8 and the whole levy bill will collapse if by June 1994&mdash;in six months time&mdash;a scheme has not been determined to the satisfaction of the Senate. If the regulations that describe tuition assurance are not to the satisfaction of the Senate, they will be disallowed by the Senate. The amendments I move on behalf of the opposition say that, if the regulations are disallowed, then clause 8 and the whole levy bill collapse automatically. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re:Provisions of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulations) Bill 1993</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overseas Students Tuition Assurance Levy Bill 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that the above Bills may be debated in the Senate during the early part of December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 8 of the Provisions of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulations) Bill 1993 (ESOS Act) and the Overseas Student Tuition Assurance Levy Bill 1993 (TAS Bill) do not have any industry support and we write to seek your assistance to defeat clause 8 of the ESOS amendments and the TAS Bill on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.The TAS Bill is not necessary. The proposed amendments to the ESOS Act, which (with the exception of clause 8) follow industry recommendation and have full industry support, coupled with effective monitoring by DEET, these changes are more than sufficient to ensure overseas students will not lose funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.The TAS Bill lacks detail as to implementation and cost. It is proposed such detail will be provided in regulation form at some future time and the amount of any levy be delegated to a Board to determine. This is a matter of serious concern. We submit that imposition of levies of this kind, which is effectively a tax, should be dealt with by Act of Parliament and not by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The administrative complexity of a TAS. The consultants are yet to arrive at any position which the joint industry/DEET working group believe is practical. It is envisaged there may be a multiplicity of Tuition Assurance Schemes which will result in additional administrative complexity and cost. A number of Colleges have indicated they may be forced to refuse entry to overseas students due to the additional administrative burden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The additional cost of a TAS will make Australian education uncompetitive. Any Tuition Assurance Scheme will be costly and additional costs will have to be passed on to students through fee increases. Overseas students have many alternative destinations in which to study and cost is one of the major factors. Australian education, which operates in a highly competitive international market place, will be less attractive to overseas students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only argument put forward by DEET to support this Bill is that "even with the strengthening of the ESOS Act, international students may still lose funds because a provider fails to put money into a trust account or wrongly takes it out".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry has proven over the past few years that they are more than capable of ensuring no overseas student is disadvantaged as a result of a College closure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's claim that they were forced to "bail out" students as a result of the closure of the ABC College in W.A. is not correct. Industry offered positions to all affected students but Government and the liquidator chose alternative action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Virtually all College closures over the past few years have been as a direct of indirect result of the sudden change in Government policy in respect to Chinese students entering this country. We would all hope such a scenario will never be repeated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Australian Council for Private Education and Training, the industry association to which my College subscribes, have agreed to run a placement scheme to ensure continuity of tuition for students should a College fail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, our Council strongly rejects the DEET stance that placement should be accompanied by extra travel expenses incurred by students, cost of new course development if necessary and reimbursement of other expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The education export industry is generating a lot of export dollars for Australia and providing thousands of jobs for Australians. The industry cannot remain competitive if it is to absorb an additional Levy for a Tuition Assurance Scheme as well as the administrative cost implications of the proposed regulations to the Bill.</PARA>

<PARA>I have read this letter very carefully. I have spoken very happily with Kathleen Newcombe, who is representative of this whole industry. I agree with every paragraph of the letter I have just incorporated. I say that in a considered way because the principles set out represent exactly where the Liberal and National parties are and, I believe, where the unanimous finding of the senate committee is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should clarify just one element. This letter calls for clause 8 to be now opposed and for the levy bill to be now opposed. I should make that clear. I do not support that, for the reasons I have just outlined. I want to make it clear that I believe these contentious areas will collapse by June 1994. The reason I put is this, and I commend this to the government: I have had discussions with the industry on the basis of there being a voluntary tuition assurance arrangement whereby all of those who are registered under the act&mdash;all the colleges, in every part of Australia&mdash;have their own ethic, their own well thought out and written code, which is not requiring legislation at all, which is not requiring any kind of exchange of money by way of a levy, and which is honourably lived up to by the colleges in the industry. Should a college fail, the other colleges will enrol the students that are left high and dry and give those students the completion of the course, even if there is a marginal cost that falls upon the college that does it. Of course, where there are any recoverable moneys for the tuition at the original college, they would be paid to the college where the student went on to complete the course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we would gain is an industry-wide agreement of their own devising, and one devised to the satisfaction of those of us with an interest in this matter&mdash;even with this proposition being put to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I believe that this is a much better way ahead than to require legislation, as in clause 8 of the first bill before us and the levy in the second. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lorraine Martin College has written in exactly the same terms; Kathleen McKenzie, principal of the Cambridge Business College; Laurier Williams, principal of the Williams Business College; Mr Jim Fung, the principal instructor of the International Wing Chun Academy; and Mr Colin Weekley, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Sydney Missionary and Bible College are samples of the industry that concur with this approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the other part of our amendments relating to notified trust accounts. We do not believe that the provisions in proposed new section 6A, enacted by clause 2 of the ESOS bill, ought to proceed at this time. That is why we will be moving in No. 2 of our amendments that subclauses (2A), (2B) and (2C) be inserted in clause 2 to qualify the notified trust accounts. That also has a deadline with regard to June 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have constantly raised questions about quality of overseas students courses, fee levels and the lack of bridging and orientation courses available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recognise the valuable benefits that overseas students bring to this country&mdash;not just financial benefits but the essential cultural exchange that takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept that internationalisation of our education system involves more than overseas coming to our soils, and the benefits are wider than just education exchange&mdash;cultural benefits, et cetera, income from trade and intercourse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to facilitate this exchange of cultures, knowledge, ideas and concepts it is important the rights of students and of institutions, including private and public providers, are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the fact that since federation we have been the recipients of overseas students it has taken a long time for us to recognise our obligations in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1986 the full cost fee recovery program in Australia was introduced and since then there has been rapid growth in this sector. To ensure that these overseas students receive the education that they paid for the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provides a legal basis for requirements for the registration of all courses offered to students from overseas and for requiring participating institutions to take steps to assure the financial security of fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also seen an Industry Commission Report into overseas students with some recommendations designed to assist overseas students, some of which were implemented last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have followed the progress of this debate, having been involved since I was previously Education Spokesperson, and have played a role in a review into the operations of the effectiveness of the ESOS Act by the Department which was taken up by the Senate Standing Committee and took place last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats have a fundamentally different philosophy towards education from that of the other parties. We are committed to an education system that is accessible and equitable for all Australians&mdash;we do not support fees and charges for domestic students and we have expressed reservations and indeed outright opposition at times to fee increases for overseas students fees when those fee increases have not been matched with quality assurance or control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unfortunate that, despite a plethora of reports and submissions on the issue of education services for overseas students, from groups ranging from the Industry Commission to the National Liaison Committee for Overseas Students (NLC) and private providers in the sector, it has taken so long for some basic recommendations to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recall my earlier days on the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training when this issue was first raised. At that point many of the suggestions made then have only just been recognised as valid and reasonable ideas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats will be supporting, with some amendments, the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1993 which seeks to strengthen the ESOS Act and the Overseas Student Tuition Assurance Levy Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We share concerns regarding the implementation of the Tuition Assurance Scheme, namely the role of regulations, the level of consultation that has taken place and the nature of those regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats have traditionally had problems with the concept of delegated legislation. The process by which legislation is moved by regulation is of concern to us as it is on the increase and once regulations are moved they can only be disallowed NOT amended and, even then, it takes careful scrutiny of the notice paper to ensure that the Government does not let them simply slip by.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the Overseas Students Tuition Assurance Levy Bill. I am pleased that at last some action is being taken to address the problems that came about earlier this year with the collapse of the college in Perth. Many people were seriously affected by that, and many of them came to me at the time to see what they could do about getting their money returned. It was a very dismal situation. People had come to Australia in good faith to be educated here, only to find that the whole thing collapsed around their ears. They were left very much out of pocket. Some of those people did not even have the money to return home. It took some time for the government to act in that matter and there was a lot of heartache for many months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that Senator Teague has moved amendments on behalf of the opposition to tighten up the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill. This bill intends to strengthen further the protection of overseas students, their prepaid tuition fees and other fees that students are required to pay to undertake a course. I commend that to the people of Australia. It is particularly important that people are protected and that someone is answerable for what is going on. The government's intention with this bill is to safeguard Australia's international reputation in the area of education services for overseas students. While this action is commendable, I, like many others, have been greatly concerned by the activities in recent weeks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who further aggravated our relationship with Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that some Malaysian students were affected earlier this year by the collapse of the college in Perth. The Prime Minister's activities in the last few weeks have certainly done our reputation a lot of damage. From what I have heard, the Prime Minister's comments, on top of the collapse, on top of the slowness with which the government acted at that time, have really worked against the interests of Australians trying to market effectively a very saleable commodity overseas. We are talking about the Australian Business College collapse that affected approximately 350 overseas students in Australia and 100 offshore students, who lost a combined total of about $2.2 million. The government, as I said, intervened on behalf of the students and provided financial assistance to those whose study had been interrupted. While that is commendable, there was certainly a great time delay before it actually happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has received advice that the overseas students tuition assurance levy could be seen as a new form of taxation. That is why it has been drafted as a separate bill, but the government maintains, I believe, that the providers must join a tuition assurance scheme to guarantee that international students receive the courses they have paid for if the provider defaults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to make any further comments on this other than to say that I hope this is the end of a very unfortunate saga that has been repeated a couple of times here in Australia. I hope we will now be able to build a reputation among those who wish to come and be educated in Australia that we are a reliable source of education and protection will be offered to people who do pay up-front fees. I hope they will ultimately be very happy not only with the tuition they get but also their time in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill and the Overseas Students Tuition Assurance Levy Bill. This matter is extremely important. In this country we have an industry that is booming; it is an industry that raises about a billion dollars a year for our economy. We are exporting a value-added service&mdash;educational provision&mdash;and it is something Australia is very good at and it should be encouraged. For this reason, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has taken a considerable interest in the matter and has had a watching brief on what is happening with regulation of overseas students for at least the three years I have been in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1991, as a response to the collapse of certain colleges, the government tried to bring in draconian legislation. I will summarise very quickly what happened with that legislation. The Senate standing committee held a major inquiry; the government backed off, accepted about 30 amendments to the bill, and brought in a more deregulated system. I believe that system was, broadly, the correct way to go at that time. It has obviously created a number of problems in that there have been collapses, such as the one Senator Knowles referred to in Perth. It was fairly obvious that what was needed was a tightening up of the legislation in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee held a number of hearings and had a number of briefings from the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The outcome was that the need to tighten was really something that appropriately should have been done through a number of minor modifications. At the time, before we realised what the government was going to do with this so-called tuition assurance scheme, we thought that might be a good idea, but as time unfolded we realised the government was trying to create yet another bureaucratic monster and to solve a fairly minor problem with a major piece of legislation that was going to create problems for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general view of the committee, particularly after hearing the evidence, was that just a minor tightening up at this stage would probably do the job. We need to strengthen and protect the act to protect overseas students. We need to make sure that the trust accounts of pre-paid funds are kept properly. We need to limit the draw-down conditions on trust accounts and we need, under this federal legislation, to extend the sunset clause beyond the start of next year to 1997, to give the states the opportunity to bring their legislation into place. We could roll back the federal legislation, which was always the intent of regulation in this industry. The government has agreed to that last provision. After hearing the evidence, most of us on the committee thought that really was all that was needed, and at this point in time that is probably all that should happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has put into the legislation, however, a tuition assurance scheme. Perhaps people on the committee and in the parliament would be more relaxed about this scheme and prepared to be convinced of its necessity if they knew what on earth it was about. I find it an extraordinary position that, on the very last day of this parliament, we are debating something called the tuition assurance scheme. We do not know what it is. Governments often do things by regulation, but this has really got to be the daddy of them all. We do not know what those regulations are and we do not even know what the principles of the bill really are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know how the government will set up and structure this scheme, how much people will have to put into this fund, what the effect will be on competitiveness in the industry as a result of the impost of this cost, and how diverse the scheme is. The government originally started with the idea of having a unified scheme but, as has become increasingly obvious, it needs a decentralised one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are in the extraordinary position of having a piece of legislation, with no idea of what the government wants to do with it. Why has this happened? The government says, `We're waiting for a consultant's report'. Yet the people from DEET admitted to us in a hearing that the first consultant's report had some serious problems in it, and it became fairly obvious to us that this consultant, whoever he was, did not really have a full appreciation of all the issues involved. That does not give us a lot of confidence that, when he brings down his final report, it will be appropriate for the legislation that is to be put forward on this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of fact, the other evidence we heard in the hearing was that many areas of the industry were extremely unhappy about what is happening with this scheme. Despite DEET's claims that it consulted widely in the scheme and took the views of industry into account, that is not what we are hearing from people from ELICOS and the Australian Council of Private Education and Training, for example. They are very disturbed by the prospect of this tuition assurance scheme, and want to see a lot more detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is strange the sorts of groups that the scheme hits. The government, when it set up this grand idea, obviously had no idea of some of the peculiar effects a tuition assurance scheme would have. For example, theological colleges get caught in this net. In the hearing, DEET people said, `Well, we'll consider whether different groups have exemptions, but it is not clear to us whether they will'. The theological colleges are affected because sometimes they train, as ministers, people from the islands. In colleges that have 200-odd students, often this will be only five or six students&mdash;but, because they have five or six students, they get caught in this government bureaucratic net. It is having an effect on an institution which, as one of them said, has been operating for 167 years and has never had any problem with student fees. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme is very poorly thought through; it is taking an enormous amount of time. There is not very much detail available to the parliament. Really, what the government should do at this point, if it has any sense, is tighten up the current act, as the industry wants and as the Senate standing committee has suggested, and leave this scheme in place until it has some idea of the principles of the act, how it is to be set up and run, what the regulations are, how it affects different groups and how much it will cost these industries. It is vital that this be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the start, we have a $1 billion industry. It is marginal in the sense that it is in a highly competitive business. Other countries are coming in and there is the possibility that they will take our markets. Even though we must assure funds for students, one of the big costs of doing so might be that our providers will become uncompetitive because there is this serious cost imposition on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason we are suggesting a sunset clause for 30 June next year. The government really has to get its act together with the tuition assurance schemes. It has offered to bring the regulations forward in one bundle, but we really need to see the whole package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be suggesting that the Senate standing committee have a very good look at this whole package when we get it. Although we support broadly the idea that there should be a tuition assurance scheme, we certainly do not want to buy a pig in a poke; we want to see what it is, what its impact is likely to be, and we will make a judgment on whether that is the appropriate way to go at that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the 30 June date will do for us is give us an opportunity to see how the strengthened act, which we support, works. That could be all that is needed. </PARA>

The reason to which my colleague Senator Knowles has referred, and the reason for the whole government proposal from the beginning, is that we are not happy that in these middle years of the 1990s we can just rely upon those other mechanisms.

The committee felt that this was the wrong way to go, because what we really needed to do was to put some pressure on the states to get their act together, and that if we took the sunset clause away then that pressure would also go. I think three years is a reasonable time. The hope is that by 1997 the state schemes will be in place and we will be able to roll back this legislation at that point.

Education providers of long standing in Australia were caught up with a provision designed to protect themselves against what can only be described as fly-by-night operators&mdash;recent arrivals&mdash;entering into an industry which was based on the idea of providing good education for people from overseas. These are people who come to Australia to take advantage of our education system and its tradition, history, values and competence, but who might be adversely affected by operators who want to operate for a short period of time, take some money and run. In an attempt to deal with that situation, it was revealed in our inquiry that the government's measure had an inadvertent effect on the well-established and the well-credentialled operators who were operating without problems or an adverse effect on their clients. </PARA>

The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to give effect to a number of changes announced in the 1993 budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It provides for a $3 a week increase in the newstart allowance from March 1994. This increase recognises the disadvantaged position of the long-term unemployed, whose numbers have risen so alarmingly under this government. As a result of a deal done by the government in order to have its budget passed, this increase will now apply also to recipients of the jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also introduces a tighter income and assets test for family payment from 1 January 1994. The income ceiling for one child will be reduced by nearly $5,000 to $60,000 a year, and the additional income allowed for each extra child will also be reduced. The assets test limit will be reduced by nearly $60,000 to $550,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in the income ceiling will mean that 116,000 families will be excluded from basic family payments. Another 2,000 families will be excluded as a result of the tightening of the assets test. This is another example of Labor pulling a swiftie on an unsuspecting Australian public. Absolutely no mention was made prior to the last election of tightening the eligibility for basic family payments. No mention of it was made during the election campaign. However, members of the government were very willing to criticise the coalition for advocating a tightening of family payment eligibility. The opposition was up-front with the people of Australia. The government chose to deceive them and then bring the assets test in after the election like it did with so many other things that we have seen since. The Australian public had the wool pulled over their eyes prior to the election and then had their eyes opened afterwards to what this government is really like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also seeks to apply the family payment incomes and assets test to any additional income earned by student families where one parent receives a prescribed education scheme payment, usually in the form of an Australian postgraduate research award. The coalition recognises that families in which one parent receives a prescribed education scheme payment are currently in an advantageous position compared with other families. One must question the equity of allowing such families to be totally exempt from the relevant income and assets tests, regardless of the income of the spouse of a student parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the office of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), this provision will mean that families with a parent receiving a prescribed education scheme payment will still be relatively better off than other families because the prescribed education payment itself will remain exempt from the income and assets test. Hence, the coalition will not be totally opposing this provision. However, we are very concerned about its retrospective application to current students. The shadow minister, Mr Ruddock, stated in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People are now being told that the family payments, which were part of their award conditions because they were not tested against this, will no longer be payable to them.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package which the student parents have talked to me about includes the exemption from the income and assets test. They are concerned that the application of this provision mid-way through their PhDs may result in them discontinuing their studies. As I said, as a former postgraduate student, I realise just how close one can get to not continuing, based on financial decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) pointed out in the other place, the savings from this measure are meagre&mdash;less than $1 million a year. It would take very few postgraduate students to discontinue their studies to offset totally any savings that would be derived from the retrospective application of this provision. I inform the Senate that the coalition will move during the committee stage to remove the retrospective application of this provision to students who have received prescribed education scheme payments prior to 1 January 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this bill gives legislative strength to the policy to limit family payment arrears to the date that a person seeks a review. It will also make it a requirement for family payment clients to notify a change in address and allow the suspension of payment if a client does not respond to a notice because he or she has failed to notify a change in address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Budget and Another Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 is the main bill before the Senate. It seeks to implement a number of election promises as well as the vast majority of the government's social security budget initiatives. During the election, Labor promised to introduce a mature age allowance. This bill facilitates its introduction from 20 March 1994. Basically, it will be available to people aged 60 and over who have not reached pension age and who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer. Recipients will not have to satisfy the normal jobsearch allowance activity test. They will also be paid at the normal pension rates and be eligible for additional assistance by way of fringe benefits, the pensioner earnings credit scheme and the pensioner rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition does not oppose this measure, it must be remembered that it has evolved from the massive unemployment problem in Australia. In effect, this measure is proof that the government, to a large extent, has given up on the older unemployed. It is tragic that the skills and experience of thousands of older Australians are being wasted. Most of the 37,000 people who are to receive the mature age allowance are fit, active and willing to work. The last thing they want is to be literally pensioned off five years early. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also facilitates the election promise to introduce an earnings credit of $500 per year for recipients of the maximum rate of jobsearch allowance, newstart allowance and sickness allowance. This credit is similar to the $1,000 earnings credit that applies to age pensioners. While ACOSS, the Welfare Rights Unit and the Australian Democrats have expressed concern about the adequacy of the earnings credit and the fact that it cannot be transferred between partners, the coalition will not oppose it or seek to amend its proposed form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of budget measures to improve the administration of jobsearch and newstart allowances are included in this bill. Two of the more important enhancements in this bill are the discretion to require a jobsearch allowee to enter into a jobsearch activity agreement and the discretion to require a jobsearch or newstart allowee to apply for an advertised vacancy. Again, the coalition will not oppose either of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we recognise that the vast majority of allowees are genuinely unemployed, there continues to be anecdotal evidence of a lack of interest in filling some job vacancies. Again, it must be pointed out that the tightening of activity testing compliance measures was roundly criticised by the Labor government when they were originally included in Fightback. The coalition is well within its rights to oppose all of these measures, given that Labor gave absolutely no indication during the campaign that it would, in its first budget after the election, move to tighten these criteria. This is yet another of the countless examples of this disgraceful, deceitful and underhand government deliberately misleading the electorate. It is my hope that the department will administer these compliance measures with the necessary amount of commonsense. People should not be required to apply repeatedly for the same job nor should they be required to apply for jobs for which they are obviously totally unqualified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also requires people who are entitled to welfare payments from foreign countries which have signed social security agreements with Australia to take reasonable steps to obtain these payments from these countries. This is another initiative that was kept from the Australian public before the last election. There is a significant difference between the amount Australia provides in welfare payments to people residing overseas and the amount received from other countries for people residing in Australia. In time, this initiative will make up a significant proportion of this shortfall, and it is supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 January 1994, an education entry payment will commence for newstart allowees and jobsearch allowees who are aged under 18 and have been unemployed for 12 months. This one-off $200 payment will benefit 6,000 clients a year. The option of full-time education is becoming increasingly more popular, particularly amongst the younger unemployed, as people come to the conclusion that it is preferable to become better educated than to waste away on the dole. The coalition supports this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also remove the rent assistance waiting period for homeless people aged under 18. The coalition supports this initiative, which has been advocated by youth workers for many years. It will provide much-needed assistance to one of our society's most vulnerable groups; namely, genuinely homeless young people, some 10,000 of whom will be assisted annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant concerns have been expressed in relation to the changes to the treatment of lump sum compensation payments that are also contained in this bill. At present, one half of a lump sum payment that contains an economic loss component is deemed to be an income related payment for the calculation of a benefit preclusion period. However, no part of a lump sum payment that does not include an economic loss component can be taken into account when calculating a preclusion period. The department contends that this has resulted in circumvention of the social security preclusion provisions by minimising or exorcising economic loss components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes in this bill would result in one half of all lump sum payments being deemed to be economic loss for the purpose of calculating preclusion periods, regardless of whether the lump sum payment actually contains an economic loss component. A new all persons average weekly earnings divisor, which will replace the current male average weekly earnings divisor, will have the effect of lengthening benefit preclusion periods. The requirement that reasonable steps be taken to obtain compensation will be extended to the partners of injured individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the exemption from lump sum payment provisions, personal sickness and accident insurance policies will be eradicated. Again, none of these savings measures were pre-empted by the Labor government prior to the election. Concerns have been expressed by solicitors, insurers and welfare advocates. It has been argued that these changes will mean that payments for pain and suffering or medical costs will be unfairly assessed as economic loss. It has also been argued that this change will mean that lump sum compensation payments will be more harshly treated than legacies and winnings from gambling. A number of concerns have also been expressed about the possible interaction between these measures and various state government schemes, particularly in relation to the specific exclusion of economic loss from lump sum payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of possible alternatives to the 50 per cent rule were put forward during the two recent Senate inquiries. These include: exempting smaller lump payments of up to $20,000 and exempting lump sum payments in which the recipient is able to prove that no economic loss component exists&mdash;in effect, a reversal of the onus of proof. The coalition is not totally convinced by any of the alternatives that have been put forward. We consider that they may be administratively cumbersome and not necessarily any more equitable than the proposal in the bill. However, the coalition remains concerned that deeming that 50 per cent of all lump sum payments for economic loss, even if a payment does not include an economic loss component, is fundamentally unfair if a person demonstrably has not suffered any economic loss. For example, if a long-term disability support pensioner receives a lump sum compensation payment, why should he or she face an extended pension preclusion period because of the 50 per cent deemed economic loss when it is manifest that no such economic loss has occurred or could even have occurred?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister, Mr Ruddock, has asked the minister whether it would be possible to extend special circumstance provisions to exclude cases in which it is manifest that no economic loss has or could have occurred. Unfortunately, the minister has not been able to provide any amendment to protect people in such a position. As a result, the coalition will move in the committee stage to oppose those provisions in the bill that deem 50 per cent of all lump sum components to be for economic loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as making a number of relatively minor changes to the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990, this bill seeks to remove the sunset clause in the act, the effect of which will be to permit the data-matching program to continue indefinitely beyond 22 January 1994. The coalition remains very concerned that the financial savings that have emanated from this highly intrusive method of fraud control have never even looked like approaching those estimated by the government in 1990 and used as its rationale for passing this legislation. At that time, it was contended that the data-matching program would be a central element of the department's fraud control program and would realise savings of $300 million a year. It has now been revealed that the data-matching savings have peaked at $70 million a year. Even this figure is very deceiving. Some $40 million of the $70 million is derived by simply asking for tax file numbers without having to do any actual data-matching whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's recent report on the data-matching program raises significant doubts about the cost effectiveness of this program. The program entails significant financial costs, both in the computerised infrastructure and recurrent administration. It also involves a significant extension of the use of tax file numbers&mdash;after assurances from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) when tax file numbers were introduced that no such extension would occur. However, in terms of benefit, it entails a small fraction of the total reviews conducted by the department and an equally small fraction of the number of cancellations, downward variations and overpayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Only about 64,000, or 2.7 per cent, of the department's 2.3 million annual reviews are undertaken under the data-matching program. Only 3.5 per cent of calculations, 3.7 per cent of downward variations and 7.8 per cent of overpayments are identified by the data-matching program. However, millions of totally innocent clients have their personal and financial information computer randomly matched on a regular basis across up to five government agencies in order to enable this program to be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not totally convinced that the data-matching program is cost effective, particularly as the government is now indicating that savings from it will now gradually fall away. We believe that the sunset clause should continue to apply to this intrusive program and that the current annual parliamentary reporting requirement should also be maintained. We will move during the committee stage to facilitate these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill contains provisions which seek to transfer 16-year-old recipients of Austudy to family allowance. Again, this savings measure was not foreshadowed during the election campaign but has been foisted on an unsuspecting Australian public by this underhand government. If passed, this change would mean that some 75 per cent of affected individuals would be worse off. Thankfully, it appears that the government does not have the numbers in the Senate and this proposal will not go ahead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to extend the remarks made by Senator Patterson, particularly with regard to the transfer of 16-year-olds to the family payments system. I believe that this particular part of the legislation impacts very severely on country families. This measure lowers the assets test radically for such families. At a time when country people are undergoing intense social and economic disruption to their lives, many families will have to face agonising choices over the level of education that their children will be able to achieve. To remove 16-year-olds from Austudy to the family payments system is neither just nor equitable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy contained a recognition of the asset rich, cash poor status of farming families in taking into account only 50 per cent of the assets of a business or farm in which the owner is substantially engaged, so doubling the standard assets test limit. This makes for a differential of $385,200. Although farmers can apply for additional family payment under the hardship provision, this is extremely onerous. Assets held can be no more than $550,000 and income must be below $13,900 and $624 per child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training have asserted that only 10 to 20 rural families would be affected by this measure. Since then, the office of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has informed us that the figure is 26 families. This appears to be based on an estimation of those rural families which will have a 16-year-old student and whose assets will fall between the additional family payment and Austudy thresholds. Even if this were correct, it does not take into account the number of rural families which will still receive income assistance but be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is to estimate the extent of disadvantage that will be suffered by the 75 per cent that the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training have estimated will be worse off as a result of this measure. It was admitted in the inquiry that this figure was unknown. The departments concerned showed a tendency to cite best case scenarios at the hearing, while being unable to produce figures as to the average effects of the change. This supports our conclusion that the government has embarked on a blind cost cutting exercise without real knowledge as to the effects of the razor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken insufficient cognisance of the way in which this bill impacts on rural families. The argument that the Austudy living away from home rate has not changed does not answer our concerns, because the evidence is that more and more rural families are unable to send their children away to board, with the result that children are now travelling long distances daily to school. This measure may well have an adverse impact on these children with its lowering of thresholds for income and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the retention rate for post-compulsory schooling has skyrocketed. The chief reason for this is the inability of young people to find employment. This is particularly so in country areas, where rates of youth unemployment are as high as 30 to 40 per cent. This legislation will then lead to the situation where parents are morally compelled to keep their children in post-compulsory education to give them some chance of employment in the future but, in doing so, they will be penalised financially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austudy recognises that education produces benefits for the nation as well as for the individual. It also recognises the high cost of education on top of living expenses in its significantly higher assets and incomes threshold. However, rather than Austudy being a means of ensuring the further education of many country children, it is being used as a means of scraping together savings to reduce the deficit. This legislation means that fewer and fewer low to average income earners in rural areas will be eligible to receive help with their children's education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation, in its submission to the Senate hearing on this legislation, stated that the changes:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that it has sufficiently taken rural families into account by not changing the Austudy system for those boarding away from home. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that more and more students are living at home, as I mentioned previously, and travelling long distances daily to school because their parents cannot afford to have them board. The government has said that only 26 farming families will be adversely affected by this measure.

The first provision of the Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to increase by $3 a week the rate of the newstart allowance paid to singles over 21 years of age. As one can imagine, the Australian Democrats welcome this increase. I am sure the nearly half a million long-term unemployed people who are recipients of the newstart allowance will also welcome it. Unfortunately, the small increase that is to be paid will be accompanied by a number of far tighter compliance measures reportedly designed to knock off about 20,000 people from the newstart allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other provision contained in this bill that I want to comment on is the reduction to be made, as of 1 January 1994, in the means test applicable to the basic family payment. Some 118,000 families are to lose their entitlement to family payments through the tighter income and assets tests that this legislation seeks to implement. The Democrats are opposed to these reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we should all be aware, the basic family payment is not intended as a welfare payment but rather is paid in recognition of the value of children to society and the costs incurred in their upbringing. Indeed, I think many senators in this place will admit, at least in terms of rhetoric anyway, that children and families are the most important and valuable resource we have. I pay tribute to the work over many years of Senator Harradine, who has pointed out to the Senate on numerous occasions that family payments can be seen as something of a tax equity measure which provides some compensation for the fact that a family raising children pays more taxes through excises, wholesale sales tax and the like. The opposition and the government should be condemned for combining to pass this reduction. For those 118,000 families to be affected, it is not much of a welcome to the International Year of the Family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the other bill before us, the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. I should point out that this bill is more than 160 pages in length with 55 pages of schedules and an index that runs to 10 pages. It contains several relatively complex provisions. Given the difficulty the opposition claims it was having with the size and complexity of the Native Title Bill, I can only hope that it has had adequate time to consider this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also be interested to know just how much consultation was undertaken with those hundreds of thousands of people whose incomes and lifestyles will be affected by this bill. I doubt if more than one per cent of these people are aware that this bill we are debating today even exists, let alone what its contents are and what its impacts will be. It seems that for some in this place only those bills which attract media interest warrant widespread public consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the specific provisions of the bill, there are a number of measures which we see as being positive steps and which we support. Amongst these are the introduction of the $200 education entry payment for the long-term unemployed; the abolition of the 18-week waiting period for rent assistance imposed on our under 18s claiming jobsearch or sickness allowance; the introduction of the mature age allowance for older unemployed people; the introduction of an earnings credit scheme able to be accessed by the unemployed in order to offset income against their benefit income test; and, finally, some of the measures designed to enhance the effectiveness of the newstart allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very much in support of these measures. However, we believe that the way in which the mature age allowance and the earnings credit schemes are being proposed is so restrictive that it may in fact defeat their intended purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look first at the mature age allowance. Under the proposed scheme, an unemployed person who is aged 60 or over but who is still below the age pension age and who has been registered with the CES for 12 months or more will qualify for a mature age allowance. The allowance will be paid at a rate equal to that of the age pension and no jobsearch effort will be required of the recipients. Under the scheme as proposed in this legislation, a mature age allowance recipient will be able to undertake work for periods of up to 13 weeks and then return automatically to the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all well and good. If they should work longer than the 13 weeks, however, they will be required to serve yet another 12 months on income support before requalifying for the mature age allowance. The Democrats believe that this 13-week limit is far too restrictive and may indeed have the effect of dissuading allowance recipients from taking work which may be offered to them. Surely that is not the government's intention, even if it does become the effect of this restriction. I will be moving an amendment at the committee stage to remove the restriction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the earnings credit scheme, which is also to be introduced in March next year. Under the scheme, jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance recipients will be able to build up a credit of up to $500 which can be used to offset income gained from employment from their allowance income tests. I should stress, however, that the credit can only be used once a year and that it will not be able to be accessed in a fortnight when the level of a recipient's earnings would preclude that person from an income support payment. The Democrats certainly support the intention of the scheme; it is these sorts of flexible arrangements that we need to be putting in place for unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme proposed for the unemployed is modelled on that which is currently available to age pensioners, although the amount and conditions of the scheme for the unemployed as outlined in this legislation are not nearly as generous or as flexible as those applying to the pensioner scheme. In the form proposed, many people would be able to undertake only a couple of days work before the restrictive conditions proposed for the scheme would preclude them from it. To take up work opportunities and to get a foot in the door to potential full-time work, the unemployed must be able to work for at least a week. No employer is going to say, `Look, I'd like to try you out. Why don't you come in for 3 1/2 days a week?'. It is a silly proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with the mature age allowance, if we impose conditions under which people may re-enter the work force which are too restrictive, then people are simply not going to take up these opportunities. I will be moving amendments which seek to address this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the measures contained in this bill to which the Democrats are opposed. The first is the changes to be made to the compliance testing of newstart recipients. Apparently, there has been a suspicion within the government and the department that the Commonwealth Employment Service has not been tough enough in its screening efforts of newstart recipients to find work. The government's response as proposed in this legislation will be to allow the Department of Social Security to `work test' newstart recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the department will be given the power to require newstart recipients to apply for a certain number of advertised vacancies and to obtain employer contract certificates from employers verifying that they have in fact applied for the vacancy. As a result of these tougher compliance arrangements, it has been reported that the government intends to throw some 20,000 people off the newstart allowance in order to save about $10 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the job market in its current state, the Democrats believe the tightening of work test arrangements to be incredibly unreasonable. Regrettably, the changes play on that old myth that there are jobs out there, people just need to look harder, and the government's job is to make them look harder. The Democrats are disappointed to see these changes being put up, and we will be opposing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next measure contained in this bill, to which the Democrats are staunchly opposed, is the change to the way the Department of Social Security is to treat lump sum compensation payments. The situation as it stands at the moment is that the department need only be satisfied that some component of a compensation payment is an economic loss component for it to take 50 per cent of the total lump sum into account for social security income testing purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from this formula&mdash;and the department acknowledges this&mdash;that the current system disadvantages some compensation recipients. No doubt the department would argue that it is only a small minority of people receiving a compensation payment who are currently disadvantaged and that the administrative benefits from the application of this rule justify this. Of course, it is of little compensation to these people to know that they are in the minority and that they are saving the Department of Social Security some paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments contained in the bill before us will exacerbate this situation by removing the requirement of the department to show that there is some economic loss component within a compensation payment. The effect of the amendments will be to apply recovery and preclusion provisions to all lump sum compensation payments, regardless of whether or not there is any component for economic loss. The Democrats are opposed to this change and will be moving amendments to remove the relevant clauses from the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was obvious to all senators present at the hearing of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;certainly to Senator Ellison and me; and, I think, even to the government senators&mdash;that this change was inequitable. I hope those senators have conveyed that message to their party rooms and will support our amendment to delete this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn, finally and very briefly, to the issue of data-matching and the sunset clause which the government is seeking to have repealed in this bill. It is history that the Democrats opposed the introduction of the data-matching program. We opposed it primarily on two grounds. The first one was that the savings which it was claimed would be achieved through the program were pie in the sky figures. In fact, they were off the planet and would never have been realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our second reason for opposing the program was that it presented major privacy concerns. Of course, both of these concerns have subsequently proven valid. I note that it is the opposition's intention to move an amendment to extend the sunset clause applying to the data-matching program for a further two years. The Democrats support this move.

This has left such people with no real choice. The choice is to compromise the plans they have made in relation to the balance of income, time, expenditure and arrangements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill proposes that the means testing applicable to the basic family payment be tightened up. Very briefly, the income limit on the basic family payment for families with one child is to be reduced from $64,938 to $60,000. The additional amount of income allowed for additional children is to go from $3,249 to $3,000. Finally, the assets limit is to drop from $607,250 to $550,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the reduction in the income test levels may not sound too significant, I note that the government estimates that some 116,000 families will lose their entitlement to the basic family payment, saving the government about $62.4 million this year and $124.9 million in a full year thereafter. That means that 116,000 families will lose their basic family payment from the tighter income limits alone. On top of these 116,000 families, a further 2,000 will lose their entitlement through the tighter assets limit, yielding savings of $600,000 this year and $2 million per year thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are opposed to these reductions in the income and assets testing levels on the basic family payment. As I said in the second reading debate, this payment is not intended as a welfare payment; rather it is paid in recognition of the value of children to society and the costs incurred in their upbringing. It acts as a tax equity measure, compensating for the additional taxes that a family raising children pays. </PARA>

On the contrary, Labor members and candidates went around the countryside campaigning and saying that the coalition was reducing the upper income threshold for family payment.

I reiterate that this is current departmental policy. It in no way infringes on the department's right to suspend a payment for a 12-month period, nor does it prevent it in any way from cancelling that payment after&mdash;and I emphasise `after'&mdash;the 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of older unemployed people is of great concern to the Australian Democrats and I note that the green paper, released yesterday, provides some concrete options for these people. As I said in my speech on the second reading, under the proposed scheme a mature age allowance recipient will be able to undertake work for periods of up to 13 weeks and then return automatically to the allowance. That is all well and good. If, however, they should work for longer than 13 weeks, they will be required to serve yet another 12 months on income support before requalifying for the mature age allowance. We believe the 13-week limit is too restrictive and may have the effect of dissuading allowance recipients from taking work offered to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, people will be reluctant to undertake a few months work if it then means they will have to go back to the jobsearch allowance and fulfil the activity test which that allowance requires for a further 12 months.

<PARA>The earnings credit scheme introduced by this legislation will allow jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance recipients to accrue a credit of up to $500, which can be offset against income gained from employment. In other words, a single person can accrue credit at a rate of $90 a fortnight and each member of a couple can accrue at a rate of $80 a fortnight. For example, a person earning $400 for a fortnight's work can use the earnings credit to discount this amount from the allowance income test. This will allow the unemployed to earn very limited casual or part-time income without automatically affecting their income support payments. We believe that for the new scheme to be of at least some benefit to recipients, the conditions governing it should be comparable to those applying to the pensioners earnings credit scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with this, the Democrats are opposed to the provision in this bill that the earnings credit cannot be assessed in a fortnight in which the ordinary income test would reduce the person's unemployment allowance to nil. No such restriction applies to the pensioners scheme and to leave this restriction in would discourage many unemployed people from taking more than a few days full-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, employers simply do not offer anything less than a week. So without these amendments, the scheme may be virtually useless to many of our unemployed people. We should remember that the credit can be assessed only once a year, so that is just a few days work in a full year. This is particularly the case for our young unemployed as they are subject to much tighter income tests on their allowances and will, therefore, find this condition on the earnings credit the most highly restrictive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With youth unemployment running at a rate of around 30 per cent, it seems ludicrous to introduce such a potentially valuable scheme and then stifle it with these restrictive conditions. For 18- to 20-year-olds, jobsearch cuts out when income reaches about $250 per fortnight. If this provision remains in the legislation, the earnings credit scheme will be useless to these people if they take a job that pays more than about $125 a week. This of course means that these young people may just simply not take the job. For the under 18s, the income cut-out point is even lower still. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the current labour market, people have to be able to take up whatever work opportunities are available to them. These days, those opportunities may be only a week or so around busy periods such as Christmas or school holidays. As such, these amendments will delete the provision that the earnings credit cannot be assessed in a fortnight in which the ordinary income test would reduce the person's unemployment allowance to nil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With our job market in its current state, people have to be able to take up whatever work opportunities are available to them and our income support system needs to be flexible enough in order to allow this. To get a foot in the door for potential full-time work, the unemployed must be able to work for at least a week, and the Democrats' amendments will provide for this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn firstly to the joint accounts issue. One of the primary aims of this initiative is to encourage participation in the work force by both members of a couple. The introduction of joint accounts could serve as an incentive for one member of a couple to withdraw from the work force. It is recognised that both members of a couple have a contribution to make to the labour force. This initiative encourages both parties to take up short-term employment, thereby increasing their overall income. By both persons maintaining links with the labour market, they are maximising their opportunities of returning to full-time employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue of the $1,000 versus the $500 credit limit. The $500 earning credit for the unemployed was an election commitment announced in the election in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the nation</EMPHASIS>. It has subsequently been endorsed by cabinet. For that reason, we cannot agree to that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the third matter. An upper limit on earnings will target the credit to low to medium income earners. The absence of an upper limit on earnings for accessing any accumulated earnings credit would be excessively generous and involve paying allowances to high as well as low income earners. Having an upper limit still represents a quite generous treatment compared with the standard income test arrangements. A married couple, for example, could have earnings of up to $677 a fortnight&mdash;and a single adult up to $416 a fortnight&mdash;and still have access to their earning credit. Credits accrued will be preserved for up to 13 weeks for those whose allowances are cancelled because their earnings exceed the upper limit. </PARA>

<PARA>The Democrats recognise some of the positive moves the government has announced in the budget to be made in relation to the management of our long-term unemployed and welcome the small increase to be paid to single newstart allowees over 21. It has been a policy of the Democrats for some time now to align the benefits paid to the unemployed with those currently paid to pensioners. We see the $3 a week increase as a small step toward that goal. Of course, there is to be no increase for those on jobsearch or sickness allowances or for those under 21. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I foreshadowed in my speech in the second reading debate, however, we are opposed to some of the changes being proposed to the compliance testing of the newstart allowance; in particular, the clauses in this legislation which allow the Department of Social Security to activity test newstart clients and to require those people to approach a certain number of employers to obtain employer contact certificates. Unfortunately, this rate of increase and these positive changes are to be accompanied by compliance measures designed to remove 20,000 people from the ranks of the long-term unemployed&mdash;not by finding them jobs, of course, but by raising the compliance hurdles and adding some more hoops for these people to jump through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are opposed to these changes, and it is not difficult to understand why. The whole idea behind the newstart agreements was that the long-term unemployed required more individual and flexible arrangements in their jobsearch efforts than those applying to the newly unemployed. The CES was seen as the most appropriate body to provide that case management service, given its ability to take into account an individual's particular circumstances and factors such as local labour market knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes proposed in this bill represent a step back to the old checking mentality and mean a greater standardisation of agreements, with little or no allowance for individual circumstances and with little or no allowance for the expertise of staff involved with the case management of clients. The other aspect of these changes is the responsibility and burden that will be placed on employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of weeks, the opposition has constantly reminded the Democrats about the burdens that employers face, particularly those employers who are involved in the running of small businesses. To begin with, employers will be contacted by the unemployed person about the job; they will then need to see that person; they will then have to fill out the employer contact certificate; and they will then have to respond to inquiries from the DSS if a review of someone's jobsearch efforts is undertaken. Let us not forget that employers will be required to complete hundreds of thousands of these certificates each year. It is simply a nightmare, as I am sure Senator Panizza would agree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition should seriously consider the effect that this could have on those involved in the running of small businesses. The situation will be exacerbated in the many areas where there are few advertised positions suitable for unskilled workers, yet there is a great number of unskilled, unemployed people. This will be particularly true in some rural areas. This proposal is simply a nightmare. Many unskilled jobs are filled without any advertising, which further narrows the number of available positions the unskilled can apply for to satisfy the new requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This could mean that the only small business in town with a job on offer would not only be inundated with people applying for the job but the business owner would also be required to complete social security forms for them. Many employers simply want someone to fill a position and have little time to fill out forms or to talk to the Department of Social Security. It is highly likely that, on top of the problems already associated with the constant job rejection, many unemployed people will have difficulty getting employers to take time to complete these certificates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is the enormous influence an individual employer may have over the income support that an individual unemployed person receives. I remind the Senate that hundreds of thousands of these certificates will require completion by employers each year. If employers refuse to cooperate, the person may risk losing his or her allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree with the evidence which was given at the committee inquiry by the welfare rights representative that we are contemplating imposing these much harsher restrictions on our long-term unemployed when there has been no increase whatsoever in the availability of employment opportunities. It is surely beyond contention that very few people are voluntarily unemployed. To impose these harsh conditions at a time of such high unemployment is surely indefensible. Perhaps when the labour market does start to pick up, these sorts of measures may warrant consideration, but they do not at present. The effect of the amendments that I have moved will be to oppose the introduction of employer contract certificates.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the general philosophical background to this change, I refer to the recent findings of the report on the post-implementation review of newstart which considered the administrative arrangements. That interim report indicated a need for better early identification of unemployed clients at risk of becoming long-term unemployed and a need to provide more intensive assistance to prevent such clients from becoming long-term unemployed. An interim evaluation of the findings demonstrated the advantages of providing assistance to those clients with barriers to regaining employment at the point at which those barriers are detected, rather than waiting until a particular duration gate has been reached. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently intensive CES assistance is primarily targeted towards NSA recipients, those unemployed clients registered by the CES as having been unemployed for more than 12 months. The measures comprise a number of administrative arrangements aimed at clients at greatest risk of becoming long-term unemployed, and supporting legislative arrangements that allow the secretary to require clients detected as being at risk of becoming long-term unemployed to enter into case managed jobsearch activity agreements with a view to arresting long-term dependency on income support. </PARA>

We understand that there are cases where the economic loss component is minimised to reduce the social security preclusion period.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the people affected by this legislation are people who have been victims of some form of industrial accident or, perhaps, a car accident. The money to be countered by these proposals may have been awarded by a court to cover past and/or future medical expenses or as compensation for pain and suffering incurred as a result of that accident. While the current situation, using the so-called 50 per cent rule, is a broad brush approach, which already disadvantages some in order to yield some administrative simplification, the proposed system will go even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that there is significant rorting of the system through the construction of compensation payments which split the settlement into two payments&mdash;one typically large, maybe for pain and suffering, and another typically much smaller for economic loss. From the outset the Democrats have acknowledged this problem and most, if not all, of the witnesses that appeared before the standing committee inquiry into this issue also acknowledged it. I concede that it is the case that such construction occurs. The amendment being proposed will take the assumed guilty approach for all compensation recipients, thereby disadvantaging those who receive a compensation payment which contains no economic loss component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A clear demonstration of the inequity of this proposal is the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act which specifically preclude claiming for economic loss. This is also the case under section 98 of the Victorian system. There have been some murmurs of acknowledgment from the government that the proposed change will be a problem in Victoria. We need to remember however that it appears highly likely that the Victorian system will be adopted by other states, notably South Australia and Western Australia, meaning that what was once a small problem in Victoria will then spread to nearly half of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further aspect in the government's thinking on this move, and I think this was admitted by departmental officers at the Senate committee inquiry, is the argument the government ran during the pensioner shares debate. The government said that people should be exhausting all other funds available to them before calling on the social security system. In some cases, I am sure that is justified. In this case, however, a person may have received those funds as a result of an industrial accident or a car accident and they may have been awarded by a court to cover past and/or future medical expenses or as compensation for pain or suffering.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had some previous experience with workers compensation before I came into the Senate. I think there is a very deep philosophical issue we have to tackle with regard to lump sum payments. We have to determine whether it is a correct approach to encourage lump sum payments at all. It is a debate that we are also having at present in the retirement incomes area. I think the inevitable shift away from lump sum payments to annuities or pensions, whatever term we may use, is a necessary one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise in the pensions area, I notice that there has been a trend in recent years for state governments and some private corporations to encourage lump sum payments or a mix of lump sum payment and pension. This is particularly so in the government sector. Whilst it might be a saving for those state governments, it is an increase in the costs that the federal government has to meet. Whether it is being done deliberately or not, people do tend to spend a part or all of their lump sum payment in the case of retirement income and then go on to the age pension. That is shifting these payments effectively from state governments to the federal government. That is a similar issue but one which we should not debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions for dealing with the treatment of compensation payments for social security purposes are intended to address double dipping by individuals and prevent compensation authorities from shifting their costs to the Commonwealth. The measures announced in the budget sought to close off a number of identified avenues for minimising the impact of current provisions. The main point of contention about these measures has been the proposal that 50 per cent of any compensation lump sum payment, regardless of whether it includes an economic loss component, be included in the formula used to calculate periods during which most social security payments are not payable. The age pension is the main exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that all parties appreciated the need to prevent double dipping and cost shifting by state compensation systems. They also agreed that the government was trying to fix a problem which needed attention. None of the compensation measures were adopted as an exercise in heartless penny pinching. I make it clear that the concerns of unions and the welfare sector have been treated seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable efforts were made to find options which would ensure that the arrangements were fair and reasonable. The minister specifically wrote to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to discuss these matters.

Consequently, the government will not be opposing the amendments to delete this provision, but it intends to revisit the matter and seek alternative solutions to the identified problem. </PARA>

I have taken a particular interest in privacy since I have been in this chamber and I was delighted that it was recognised the other day. I received a Christmas card from someone who recognises that I have taken a long interest in the matter. On the front of the card, Santa is up against some computer equipment and it reads, `He knows when you've been sleeping; he knows when you're awake; he knows when you've been bad or good', and inside the card reads, `You probably can sue him for invasion of privacy'. I thought that was quite appropriate when we are discussing the Privacy Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sunset clause and the reporting arrangements were included in the data-matching act as a safeguard due to the significant privacy ramifications of the program and the doubts over its financial benefits. As I said in my second reading speech, the Australian National Audit Office report that was tabled in October demonstrates that these concerns, which were expressed by both the coalition and the Australian Democrats in late 1990, were totally valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs one would think we looked into a crystal ball and said, `What if? Can you do this? How did you estimate that?'. We were nearly 100 per cent right and the government was nearly 100 per cent wrong. That is how bad it was. We were told that we would be jeopardising all these savings. I think I have mentioned before that we were going to change one word in the bill and Mr Hawke wrote to Dr Hewson making some extravagant claim that we were going to affect the savings. That has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I outlined in detail in the second reading speech and when the report came down that the government did not make the savings that it said it was going to make. We believe that the sunset clause should remain so that the parliament can observe what is happening and decide whether this very intrusive measure is warranted. It is also important that the department reports to the parliament on the basis which was required in the original bill and now in the act. That enables us, as representatives of the people, to look very closely at what is happening and how the guidelines are being met. From my discussions with the Democrats, I believe that they will be supporting the amendments and the extension of this sunset clause. </PARA>

This is demonstrated by the fact, which was his other key point, that the very large number of the matches have proven, following further internal investigation by the department, to not be of value, which emphasises the fairness of the safeguards. In addition to the success of the safeguards we still have, no matter how one looks at the matter, substantial savings from the scheme.

So even the Privacy Commissioner anticipates the continuing success of the program. I realise that we will lose and, as we have to get home for Christmas, I will say no more.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a rather long delayed start to the committee stage of consideration of the Native Title Bill but I think, on balance, the delay may expedite our consideration of this matter. The reason why there has been some delay is not only the pressure of other business, but the need to try and put a mass of complex material into a format that would expedite our discussion. I think every minute of the delay so far has probably saved us two or three minutes of possible confusion in the chamber. I hope that confusion will now be able to be avoided as a result of the material before honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Party leaders and those leading the debate should have in front of them a committee stage running sheet of some 13 pages which goes basically clause by clause.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will explain the nature of the running sheet and how the material is organised. Basically, the bill is addressed down the left hand column from the preamble through to clause 238 in order. The right hand columns indicate where amendments are to be moved. Those amendments are grouped, so far as possible, by subject matter in order that, so far as is possible and reasonable, the debate can coalesce around particular subject areas in sequence taking place at the time the subject matter in question first arises, thus avoiding, hopefully, repetition as one works one's way through the bill and encounters the same subject matter on a number of future occasions. That is the basic concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The material honourable senators have before them consists in the first instance, apart from the bill itself, of course, of three bundles of amendments that were circulated yesterday by the government, the Democrats and the Greens, respectively. The government's list of amendments runs from 1 to 74; the Democrats' amendments from 1 to 52; and the Greens' amendments from 1 to 65. There are in addition some further amendments representing redrafting of some of those already circulated amendments. I am not sure that it is complete, as circulated so far, or that everybody has them so far. But there are some government amendments in that category; there are some Green amendments in that category; there are some Democrat amendments in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, there are a couple of pages of supplementary Democrat amendments labelled 2A and 28A, respectively.

If we had delayed the start-up of the debate by another half hour, we could have had all material in front of us, but it has not been possible to do that. There is ample material before us on which we can now start.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I might, I will mention further that it ought to be possible, in my judgment, provided a reasonable approach is adopted to the conduct of this debate, to work through the groups of amendments as they now stand in a reasonable time. What that reasonable time will be, I do not know, but I would hope that if we broke only for an hour over dinner and that if we worked our way systematically through this and there was not too much unnecessary repetition, it might well be possible to conclude this whole committee stage debate some time late tonight. I think it is obviously in everybody's interests to do that, given the difficulties about transport and so on. If it is not possible to do that, well, so be it. We will just have to make other arrangements&mdash;I am not quite sure what they are going to be&mdash;tomorrow afternoon or indeed Sunday. But the hope and the intention have been that now that the material is organised in the way that I have described&mdash;and those supplementary amendments are being duplicated in the office as I speak and will be distributed around the chamber; that is, the small group of amendments, some seven or eight in total, I think, to add to the three bundles honourable senators have already&mdash;they will be in the chamber certainly before we get to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, I think if it is understood the way it is proposed to proceed through the running sheet in this way and if we are prepared to accept the principle of amendments being put together and debated in subject groupings, it may well be possible to conclude this debate at a reasonable hour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very important that we examine the process by which what is, supposedly, one of the most significant pieces of legislation to have been introduced into this parliament, has been handled over the last few days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am appalled at the cavalier manner in which Senator Gareth Evans has essentially just distributed pieces of paper at the last minute. For example, I note that yesterday we were given a one-page document of government amendments grouped by subject matter. It lists various blocks with clauses alongside them. When we look at the running sheet, which was delivered within the last hour, we find that it does not quite accord with that sheet. There has been virtually no opportunity for any sensible digestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What appals me above all is the way in which Senator Kernot seems to approach this whole matter. She ought to be captain and coach of the industrial relations club. She talks about a consensual process; what I take her to mean by that is that essentially the democratic process is not good enough for her. What she wants is deals behind closed doors. In her extremely sanctimonious way, she criticises anyone who dares to say that we ought to be allowed to understand amendments so that we can contribute to the debate. Whether or not she has taken a position of opposition, I would have thought that she would at least tolerate, if not welcome, the opportunity for others to comment on the significance of amendments. But no. All we have from Senator Kernot is the statement that we were given the principles of Democrat amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I walked into this place today, I was handed by Senator Gareth Evans a couple of Democrat amendments, 2A and 28A, to go with the amendments circulated yesterday by Senator Kernot and, again, I suppose, further amendments headed `Replacement and new amendments' in the name of the Democrats. So what we end up with is Senator Kernot with an intention, obviously, to have as little discussion as possible, to leave the chamber whenever she is confronted with the reality of her own hypocrisy, and to not be prepared to practise what we all profess to preach in this place&mdash;in other words, the Democrats are into the politics of exclusion. They do not want a sensible parliamentary debate; that would be far too democratic. What they want is to do deals outside the chamber. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had people coming to us during the course of this morning saying, `What's going on?'. We have said that what we understand is going on is that the Democrats and the Greens and the government all have their heads together and are trying to put together some amendments that will suit everyone, and then they can come in here, put the package on the table and say, `There you are, done'. From what we can understand, at the last minute, that process has not quite worked&mdash;but not for want of support on the part of the Democrats. The Democrats clearly think that that is the way we do parliamentary business&mdash;that we do not expose issues to debate, that we do not try to explain what amendments are all about; we simply rush things through because they have been agreed beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was a classic demonstration proving the need for a special examination by a select committee&mdash;for which we have long argued&mdash;it is before us today in that we have been given in the order of 200 amendments, which we have had no opportunity to comprehend and no opportunity to make comments on. The best one could possibly do is start from a position of principle and say, `Well, in general terms, this is our impression'. We take legal advice on the run. Everyone knows that not all lawyers agree&mdash;and why should they, any more than all senators do? How can anyone possibly do as we did&mdash;sit down with hand delivered amendments three-quarters of an hour or an hour ago, try to understand what those amendments mean and then come in here and make an intelligent contribution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we have Senator Kernot carrying on as though somehow it is hypocrisy on our part to want to understand these things. In other words, if she is serious about the parliamentary process, which clearly she is not, she would have acknowledged long ago the overwhelming need for a select committee process. Yet, from the very outset, that is the last thing the Democrats would countenance. What they had in mind was deals, deals, deals, and that is what they have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to put on the record that the Democrats' approach to this whole debate is even more scandalous than the government's in many respects. It simply destroys any claim they might have had to keeping anyone honest, because they just do not know the difference between honesty and dishonesty. As Senator Hill rightly says, part of the family, part of the group, part of the IR club approach&mdash;consensual politics has replaced democratic politics and now we have to pay the penalty. No doubt we will do the best we can. But if people ever doubted this was a model of how not to go about things, they ought to go back and study what has happened over the last 24 hours and they will see that this is the worst possible way to debate probably the most significant piece of legislation that has come before the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my first remarks to Senator Gareth Evans with respect to some of his remarks which he has never substantiated and which ought to be substantiated if we are to proceed with this debate and deal with this bill before Christmas. I refer to Senator Evans saying, `Look, there's a fragile consensus on this bill, this being the appropriate response to Mabo No. 2, and if we let it fall out past Christmas, well, the consensus will be gone'. That, I understand, is his reasoning. I have heard all variations of that, but that is basically what has been said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fundamental flaw in that reasoning. What Senator Evans wants to say to us in this chamber is that, if they, the Labor Party and the Democrats, and I do not know whether we know what the Greens or Senator Harradine are doing yet, find that what they are going to do now is very unpopular&mdash;if over January they find out it is acutely unpopular&mdash;they might not have the guts to go ahead. That is what those opposite basically are saying; they are such a weak and gutless bunch of people that they would not proceed with this, which I understand very many of them genuinely believe is the appropriate response to Mabo No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that. I think some people do not perhaps extend the same courtesy to what we think is the appropriate response to Mabo No. 2. Nonetheless, some people think this is the genuine and better response. If those opposite really think that, and if they are not part of a pack of gutless wonders, why would they not want to have their legislation, their response, properly dealt with? Why would they not want to have every nook and cranny of the legislation right? Why would they not want to have all of the amendments properly considered? The only reason they can offer for proceeding with this legislation is that they are too chicken to face the public response that they may well get if they go into January. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that is a fundamentally unacceptable way to proceed to make legislation because Labor and the Democrats are saying, `We're the parliament in here and we want to do this. But, heavens above, if people find out what we are doing, they might not like it and then we'd go another way. We would not have the guts to proceed if more people decided that they didn't like this'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a problem for me because I do not have that view. But I think it is a problem for everyone who wants this bill dealt with before Christmas, who wants the amendments not considered properly, who wants this rushed through. The only reason for rushing it through is that they are such a pack of gutless wonders with no stomach at all to face any debate that may or may not arise in January. They are such a pack of gutless weaklings that they had better rush it through now, otherwise it would be a bit awkward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see one senator over there smiling at me and I suspect it is because the mirror has been put up in front of him and he recognises something. That is what I suspect. He recognises that his party is asking him to join in with the Democrats and some others and pass some legislation irrespective of whether the detail of it is right or wrong. The reason his party is asking him to do that is that it knows that if it is electorally unpopular, the government will not have the guts to do it when we come back. It is fundamentally unacceptable to say, `We must rush legislation through here, otherwise the public will find out about it, and if they are all unhappy about it, heavens, we might not have the guts to go ahead'. That is a fundamentally unacceptable way to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in any event, I think there are some other points that need to be made with respect to some remarks made by Senator Kernot. I will not repeat at length Senator Alston's remarks, but what he says is right; Senator Kernot says, `Look, you do not understand. There has been a consensual process about this'. Why do all these taxpayers here fund this building, fund the staff, fund the parliamentary library and all the research facilities that we have? Why do we bother with all of this? Why do we not just vote from our electoral offices because then the convenient deals could be done in back rooms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The natural consequence of what Senator Kernot says is: unless we are prepared to deal on this particular issue this particular way, unless, for example, in this case we think this is the appropriate response to Mabo No. 2 and unless we come to the table with that view, then the doors shut in our face, and if the poor suckers think that when it gets to parliament we will be able to debate it, think again, because the executive with power of numbers and a deal being done in the back room is going to make parliament irrelevant. I do not think any of those opposite should be proud of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward, not to this legislation being passed but if it is passed, to it coming back to be amended and reminding all the gutless wonders in this place that they took part and encouraged the bill to be passed without proper consideration. It will remind them of the expenses incurred by private citizens&mdash;the government does not have to worry about it; it will not cost anyone in here anything if it is all wrong. The government does not have to worry; someone else can foot the bill. Those opposite can come back and have their salaries and they will be okay. They can say, `Oh, well, Christmas was a bit busy'. If we had former Senator Powell here, she would say, `I want to go home'. That was the excuse for rushing things through last time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I want to make with respect to Senator Kernot is that consensual politics is, I think, a substitute for the better democratic process. It says, `Unless you'll come and do a deal at our table on the meal of our choice, you'll be locked out, and if you poor suckers think parliament is going to have influence on the deal that we come to, think again, because by force of numbers we'll shove through whatever we like'.

Why do we not let everybody else work out the detail and not us?</PARA></TALK.START>

There is a clear implication that anyone who does not agree with Senator Kernot does not care about it; anyone who does not think this is the appropriate response to Mabo No. 2 does not care about it. What she is trying to say is that all us heartless people over here do not care about it. I just want to inform Senator Kernot that I happen to be of the view&mdash;I certainly know it is true for me and I believe it to be true in the case of my colleagues&mdash;that we simply have a different view as to how Mabo No. 2 should be responded to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is no secret that the Greens wanted more consultation, time and community scrutiny before this legislation was dealt with. The opposition has to share some of the responsibility for the fact that there was a concern in the community, a concern that the government capitalised on, about the failure to deal with this legislation quickly, about a delay and about the effects of that debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the opposition must accept responsibility for the fact that it declared early on that it was not prepared to support a bill that would be the first in our history that actually attempted to give justice to Aboriginal people. The obstructionism and attitude of the opposition have generated concern within the broader community that this one opportunity to deal with this matter would pass by and that Aboriginal people again would be disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received many requests from people within the Aboriginal community who would love to have been consulted, who would love to have had the opportunity to speak for their land. They had no confidence&mdash;I share their lack of confidence&mdash;in the parliamentary process and the community process to offer that to them. The committee offered that opportunity and the committee had the opportunity of looking in a more fair way at the legislation. I believe that it failed to do that and there is no evidence that this legislation's being referred to a committee for a longer time would actually improve the chances for justice that Aboriginal people have been hoping for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that many of the Aboriginal people who have contacted me are hoping that this legislation will not be passed because they are not confident that it, in itself, will offer any protection or justice for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens want to make very clear what we think about this bill. We believe that this bill is not about justice for Aboriginal people. It is about resource security for the mining and pastoral industries and very little else. Pat O'Shane said to me just today that this is not about Aboriginals' rights but about other people's rights, and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the opposition is posturing when it opposes this bill because, in fact, there is much in this bill that it has nothing to worry about. However, it may not gain votes from that. I believe that we have to step away from a party political view of what we are discussing today. I believe there are flaws here. I believe there is a need for all parties within this chamber to share their different perspectives but to do it with a respect for what we are actually discussing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that there are three very different views reflected here. The first is the opposition position. I believe the opposition, in its requests for delay and for more consultation, needs to look at its own record because it is not admitting the need to redress the injustices of 200 years. It is actually presenting the view that it is unjust to positively discriminate in favour of Aboriginal people at this point in history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second position is the Labor Party position. I do not agree with that position either. It is a fear of fully dealing with the historical injustice that Aboriginal people have suffered because of the anxiety, the consequences on the country and a desire to placate everyone, including some Aboriginal interests, but with far too much emphasis on economic certainty, on mining and pastoral concerns and state involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Democrats and the Greens share a common concern that something be brought out of this legislation that will be for the benefit of Aboriginal people, certainly the Greens' concern is that it will be held back from being simply a composite meld of the various competing interests being satisfied. The Greens' position is that we have to acknowledge the truth of the historical injustice. Until we acknowledge it, then no healing or reconciliation is possible. If this legislation fails to at least protect existing native title rights, based on the High Court's decision, it is unacceptable to the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee stage of the Native Title Bill, as we perceive it, is the chance the Greens have of trying to extract some justice for Aboriginal people from a bill that gives less than the Mabo High Court decision. If we cannot, the legislation will not gain our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the people who will suffer if this bill does not go through are those, some of whom are in the gallery, who are waiting on the response of this parliament to the injustice of 200 years. They are the ones who will suffer if they do not get this legislation. If this bill does go through, there are other people in the Aboriginal community in Western Australia who will also suffer because this bill is not meeting the needs of those who are totally dispossessed, who do not gain from the High Court's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is this parliament's responsibility to try to address this debate in the most respectful and dignified way possible so that the best legislation possible can be achieved, despite the fact that we have been rushed and despite the fact that it should have been done in a far different way with a better process of consultation and community scrutiny.

I would ask her to explain how many came to her with differing viewpoints and considerations. Of course, there were many of them. I acknowledge that 50 or 100 of them have been in the House just about every day this week, talking to people all around the building. But what about the other 260,000 Aboriginal people in the community for whom we have a responsibility to get this legislation right?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is terribly important. This afternoon&mdash;or this evening, or tomorrow, or the next day&mdash;I specifically want to speak to 14 issues that I have identified as having a very major impact on the Aboriginal constituents of the Northern Territory, whom I represent, as well as, of course, the Northern Territory government's interests on behalf of the entire Northern Territory community and on behalf of all of the industry that makes the economy of the Northern Territory work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the legislation should be to treat all Australians, including Aboriginal Australians, under a just and fair land administration system.

I want that debate to happen in here, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, not&mdash;in Senator Kernot's words&mdash;out the back of the dunny somewhere, where a deal in that area has been done. We do not do deals in that way. We want the constitutional debate. I want to test a number of the Green amendments. There is a Green amendment proposed that will destroy the national park system of the Northern Territory. I want to test the Greens on that, fundamentally because of their Green credentials. I appreciate that they are representing an Aboriginal constituency viewpoint, but on the other side they are completely changing and altering the national park system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a tribunal process proposed in this legislation which makes a complete mockery of the normal legal processes of Australia. What is going to happen in a year's time or five years time when I have to front Aboriginal people throughout Australia and say, `The reason you're not getting a decent system of native title in Australia is that it's caught up in the High Court in appeal after appeal after appeal', because of the way in which the legislation will get caught up in those legal areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are enormous economic implications for the country in this legislation. They need to be tested and teased out and put on the table and properly acquitted by this government on behalf of the Aboriginal people. I want to know that there is certainty to back up the commitment to Aboriginal Australians. In dealing with these 238 clauses and, now, about 258 amendments, I want to know that those economic issues have been addressed. What about the creation of the new land acquisition fund, which is going to have phenomenal consequences for Aboriginal people and other Australians all around the country? The implications of purchase in this area are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I am sure all honourable senators know the importance in the Northern Territory of the role of native title and its consistency with the Aboriginal Land Rights Act that is already in the place of legislation of this parliament.

I listened to Senator Chamarette, and I listened to Senator Kernot and Senator Spindler. The impression I got was that somehow it is something to be feared to consult with the Australian people more widely to get their views and to get their thoughts. Senator Chamarette said that the Australian people were concerned about the approach of the Liberal and National parties on this issue. That is not what I have heard. I think she is totally wrong, but she may be right. That is an issue which I believe should be tested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that Senator Kernot dropped that great slogan of Don Chipp's to `keep the bastards honest', because this is a classic occasion when the parliament should operate. This is an immensely complex bill which has huge consequences for the future of this nation. This is the occasion to consult widely with the people&mdash;not just a group of people who may be Senator Kernot's supporters or Senator Chamarette's supporters&mdash;to get their views and to try to bring the community with us. </PARA>

It would be very handy to find out what is the full nature of the deal that has been struck. Senator Kernot has the chance to get up and make a comment on that. The founders of the Australian Democrats felt that they could trust the people; they were here to operate on behalf of the people to keep this parliament honest. The Democrats have now joined forces with the power blocks in this country in order to ram this particular bill through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a final great irony in this matter. Senator Evans, who has been so keen to open up the scrutiny of the Australian legal system to UN committees, who has fought hard to do that, and who has overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act, does not want those very laws to be properly scrutinised and debated in this parliament. It is a great pity that the smaller parties are taking this approach to this particular issue. I am not afraid of what our people think. I am not afraid to get out and consult widely with them&mdash;with all people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find myself in a situation that is probably different from the situation of anybody else in this chamber or any of their expressions of opinion in this first commentary on clause 1 of the Native Title Bill in the committee stage. We are all at one in one aspect: we all acknowledge that this legislation involves deep questions of social justice, equity and certainty before the law. It is the parliament's duty to address these questions against the need, in my view, for reconciliation and healing amongst all peoples of this country. It is also the parliament's duty to do so in the best interests of all Australians in a manner which does not do irreparable harm to the federal compact upon which the constitution is based.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, there are a number of possible responses to Mabo No. 2. There is the response that we in this federal parliament do nothing. For example, each claim would go to the courts. Surely that response would fail against some of the principles that I have mentioned, not the least of which is certainty before the law. It should be remembered that Mabo No. 2 was not a unanimous decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other response is that the matter should be left to the state parliaments. That, too, would fail on equity grounds and probably on certainty before the law grounds because we could well end up with six different statutes dealing with the questions in six different ways. I have always been of the view that land management issues are essentially state issues. I acknowledge that. But we have to look at the other principles and when we consider the other principles we must remember the 1967 amendments to the constitution which were deliberately made to enable the federal parliament to deal with these questions in special circumstances. I believe this is a special circumstance. </PARA>

I am particularly concerned to see that, at the end of the day, we end up with a system in Western Australia that gives justice and fairness to all. I do not believe this legislation will do that. More than that, I believe it will lead to long, drawn-out constitutional challenges to its validity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, as I have done on a number of other occasions and as I did in the debate on the industrial relations legislation the other night, I want to say that I think there has been a dangerous consistency of events. More and more legislation is being put through this parliament that we all know when we vote on it will end up in the High Court. I think that is a reflection on the parliamentary process. It is a reflection on the integrity of the people who operate here. I want to put that on the public record and I want to put it to the government, the Green senators and the Democrats that they need to look very, very carefully to make sure that, as these processes go through, we do not consistently pass key legislation that ends up in the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to voice my concern about the butchery of the democratic process which is occurring here. I think it is quite tragic. Of course, the victims of this process are justice, equity and fairness. When we finish this debate, whether it is at midnight or whether it is Saturday or Sunday or Monday or whenever it might be, I believe that we will end up with legislation&mdash;because I think at the end of the day the Greens will fall over and vote with the government&mdash;which does not meet those objectives. I also want to put that on the public record. I do not think it is in the best interests of this chamber to pass legislation in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it regrettable that Senator Kernot should insinuate in her comments that, because we said we were going to oppose all the amendments to this legislation, in some funny way we have given away our rights to actually debate it. I believe that was the core of what she was saying. I cannot believe that any senator could actually say that. There are many pieces of legislation that come into this place which we do not seek to amend. But that in no way takes away any of the rights of individual senators to question any clause in any bill, particularly a bill of this nature. I think that we have the right&mdash;and we should use it&mdash;to go through each bill clause by clause and get from the government on the table what its intentions are and what the actual clauses mean in plain, explained English, and I want to emphasise that&mdash;plain, explained English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine said that we should all be across all the issues. I doubt whether there is anybody in this place who is across all the issues of the Mabo decision. Let us look at the judges' decision. Three of the judges, Justices Mason, Brennan and McHugh had one view; Justices Deane and Gaudron had a variation on that view; Mr Justice Toohey had another variation on the view; and Mr Justice Dawson had a significantly different view. I do not know how Senator Harradine could make that statement in respect of an issue like this one. What we have to do is respond as best we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We will be debating the bill clause by clause because we do not believe that it will serve the interests of Australia; we do not believe that it will serve the interests of all Aboriginals. That is a very, very difficult thing to do. It is not a simple thing to do. I have been trying to come to grips with the amendments that have been put before us at this late hour. It is not dissimilar to what happened with the industrial relations legislation. We suddenly had a huge number of amendments thrown at us and we had people running in circles trying to come to grips with those amendments. The same thing is going on here now. I think it is something like 200-odd amendments that we have before us. I think that is quite tragic for the democratic process of dealing with the amendments in a meaningful manner and getting down to the nitty gritty of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again I wish to raise the issue of fairness to the people who work in this place, who serve us. I want to relate that back to the industrial relations legislation that we dealt with the other night. People from that end of the chamber, from over where the Greens are and from that side of the chamber from time to time were yelling at us, `What about the worker; what about the employee?' It is now 6 o'clock. We have only recently received the amendments and we have the prospect of working all through tonight and all day tomorrow; we do not know. What about some fairness to the attendants who work in this place? What about some fairness to the staff who work in this place? What about some fairness to the dining room staff? I could list all the staff who work in this place. </PARA>

Why they do not just save their shoe leather and sit in there with caucus and vote on the decisions, I do not know.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Evans to put himself in our position, and I am sure that he would be outraged. I know that in his heart of hearts he is very embarrassed because he knows that to start the committee stage of what is probably the most important legislation to come before this Senate in a decade at 4.30 p.m. on a non-sitting Friday is really outrageous. There are over 200 amendments, some of which&mdash;as he said, amendment 14(A)&mdash;were delivered to the leadership group about 15 minutes before the committee stage was about to begin. That is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering that we have had over 205 years without this Mabo legislation, the argument that it has to be passed in haste before Christmas is just not on. I really cannot see that, in the interests of good administration, another two or three months will make very much difference to the perception of whether or not the obligations of the government have been properly carried out. This legislation must be right and, as has been pointed out, there is a very fair chance that it will come back again and again. The people who have been looking at it are looking at it again right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot about consensus from this Labor government over the last 10 years. I think Senator Evans himself, or perhaps it was Mr Keating, said that this Mabo legislation was built upon a very fragile consensus. I was reminded the other day that somebody said, `You point out to me a politician who talks about consensus and I'll point out to you a fraud'. Government is not about consensus; it is about doing the right thing; it is about, taking a stand, having a vision and going for it, and doing the best you can. We are elected to this place to improve the prospects of our electorate, our state, and everybody in this country. We are not about enacting legislation that puts one group of Australians in front of, or in a different place to, another group of Australians. Unfortunately, this legislation does just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned amendment 14(A) which, as Senator Evans said, was circulated to party leadership. A request was made of his office, and he very kindly said he would send somebody down to give us a briefing. The public servant from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said that the legislation had been withdrawn. I guess this whole exercise is just not the way in which a sophisticated Western democracy should operate. I believe that all of us in this chamber should be condemned by the performance of the government. This legislation will not serve the interests of all Aboriginal Australians, and it will certainly not serve the interests of all Australians.</PARA>

There is nothing wrong or dishonest in making the choice to do that. In fact, I believe it was sensible and probably helpful because we have had the opportunity to improve wording, to tidy up loose ends, to understand the fine points of difference in the positions we hold; and we have had the opportunity to understand the substantive matters so that we can group the amendments in a logical and reasonable way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic concept is to take the bill almost clause by clause on the way through, but there are a large number of clauses that do not attract amendments and hopefully we can jump over those pretty quickly. When we get to a particular subject matter for the first time in that sequential approach, it is then proposed that at the same time there be debated other clauses and amendments bearing upon that same subject matter. Thus, for example, when we get down to clause 4, that clause simply is a kind of index provision to the rest of the bill, but that is a useful first opportunity to address the question of financial assistance to states and to deal with the actual incorporation of the proposed new part 8A as a result. Another part of clause 4 is a trigger for consideration under this principle of the parliamentary joint committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I suggest that the debate for each one of these subject matters thus identified be a cognate one with all the relevant clauses and amendments grouped in this way being debated together. Equally, it will usually be possible, I suggest, for the amendments in question to be put together rather than individually. But, of course, if any senator seeks a particular amendment to be put separately or the issue to be broken up in some way, there is no difficulty at all about accommodating that, and that will occasionally be helpful. I hope that with that explanation we can proceed to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quickly repeat for the benefit of those honourable senators I have not had a chance to talk to personally that, although quite a litter of paper has been distributed around the chamber, really only six or seven documents are relevant to the debate as it now stands. They are the three master sheets of amendments for the government, Democrats and Greens, respectively. Then there are just three supplementary government amendments, and that is the sheet that has in the top right-hand corner `Government 44A'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the Democrats are concerned, senators should find a couple of sheets of paper stapled together with `DEM 2A' written in the top right-hand corner with the Democrats' amendment No. 9A behind it. Then there is a separate sheet of paper also circulated with the Democrats' amendment No. 28A. So that, together with the Democrats' master sheet, constitutes the Democrat amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the Greens are concerned, in addition to the master sheet of amendments, there is just one stapled document labelled&mdash;again, in handwriting in the top right-hand corner&mdash;`GREEN 1A'. That represents the Greens' redrafted supplementary amendments as they stand at the moment. There will be just a handful of additional amendments about which discussion on drafting is still proceeding that may be circulated at a later stage, but we certainly have ample material before us to get a very long way into the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, at any stage, people want to defer consideration of a particular clause, perhaps to enable some further discussion of it or for whatever reason, I see no particular difficulty in accommodating that, although I think it ought to be possible on the way through to follow the sequence that is set out in the master sheet. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have moved just one amendment to the preamble&mdash;government amendment No. 1&mdash;and it relates to the question of the desirability of there being regional agreements. The government has received a number of representations about this. Most have suggested that there be greater detail about such agreements set out in the bill itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak to both the preamble and the amendment. The preamble, I think, is intended to set out the government's general philosophical direction. It undoubtedly does that from its perspective, but I think it certainly overstates the case when it purports to express views on behalf of the entirety of the people of Australia. In that sense, it is, I think, a little more than a political statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words `The Parliament of Australia therefore enacts' is of course the usual introductory clause, and we find that at the end of this preamble. But before we get there, we have statements like, `The people of Australia intend to rectify the consequences of past injustices'. It is one thing to say that as a result of the High Court decision there is now a very different approach taken not just to native title but also to the rights of the Aboriginal community as they currently are, but one cannot of course right any wrongs that might have occurred many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, if one adopts the normal approach of looking at who might be responsible for an injustice, it is completely unfair, I would have thought, to suggest that those who did not believe that they were committing any injustices should therefore be condemned with the vision of 20-20 hindsight. Therefore, I think that is just another example of an overstatement of the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble talks in terms of the needs of the broader Australian community requiring certainty and the enforceability of acts potentially made invalid. I think all one can say is that the whole of the rest of the bill gives the lie to that noble aspiration. Certainly no-one would deny the need for certainty and enforceability, but to suggest that in any shape or form this bill does much in that regard is, again, a gross overstatement of the position and simply makes it a very tendentious political document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It makes clear, for example, that what was spelt out by the High Court is to be significantly varied. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where appropriate, the native title should not be extinguished but revive after a validated act ceases to have effect.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a deliberate variation from what the High Court has said. It says also that native titleholders' rights and interests `under the common law of Australia need to be significantly supplemented'. Again, that is certainly not anything that flows from the High Court decision. It is simply a conscious decision on the part of the government as part of a social justice package and one that will need to be followed up in subsequent legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is quite incorrect to put this document forward as though it is simply the unanimous will of the people that the Mabo decision be reflected in this legislation because there is, I think undoubtedly, a very high degree of controversy about the implications and the extent of that decision. It has been described, for example, as the greatest obiter dicta in history, and anyone who understands the law has to recognise that this decision was only confined to one group of offshore islands so that ultimately any decision about the rest will have to be reconsidered by the High Court. Undoubtedly, it will do so in the context of this legislation. But to make sweeping statements about what the High Court has done and what the people of Australia intend, I think, goes well beyond what one would normally expect to find in a preamble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say briefly in relation to the amendment that we find it objectionable for two reasons: it says, `Governments should, where appropriate, facilitate negotiation on a regional basis'. It clearly purports to tell state governments how to organise their affairs. It certainly says that this should take place in relation to land and proposals for the use of land for economic purposes. Again, the constitution makes it plain that land management decisions are the responsibility of the states, yet this preamble baldly asserts that there is a bounden duty and obligation on all governments, state and federal, to negotiate on a regional basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take that at face value, at which I suppose it is intended to be taken, then this is effectively telling the states to ignore their own boundaries, to adopt an entirely non-federal approach to what is essentially a state issue. Therefore, if the constitution is to have any meaning&mdash;and we certainly believe its meaning is clear&mdash;then this preamble would simply negate it for other political reasons. It is certainly not acceptable for that reason. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that in addressing this the government would also have turned its attention to the necessity of satisfactory agreements or consultations with states and territories in addition to proposing regional agreements. Whilst the purposes as stated in the preamble are very obviously to treat all landowners fairly and to create a just and fair land administration system, the Native Title Bill provides in the Northern Territory, which I represent, a system of land administration which has been nationally rejected and it is entrenched. That is particularly in respect to Northern Territory land rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are provisions in the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory that relate to veto on mining, to doubt over the application of Northern Territory law, to the fact that there is no ability to compulsorily acquire land and for government assets to be not subject to claim. This bill changes all of these problems for a national application and, in doing so, highlights the inconsistency of the existing legislation of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act. If the tenets of this particular preamble are to apply and there is to be an equality, then very obviously the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory must be amended. Therefore, in putting forward amendments that relate to a regional basis, that provides an application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that the Democrats have an amendment subsequent to this in clause 41 of the legislation to which I think it is important to allude. That amendment changes words in that clause, which relates to subdivision where satisfactory alternative state or territory provisions exist. The Democrats propose to take out of clause 41 `are overruled on the grounds of State or Territory interest or of national interest' and insert `are overruled in a state or territory interest or in the national interest on grounds that are consistent with the preamble'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that amendment will probably have to be argued again when we reach clause 41, but if that Democrat amendment were subsequently adopted and considered in the context of this preamble, there would very obviously be a limitation imposed on the states and territories. In fact, that would be unprecedented with regard to legislation. So I would certainly ask Senator Kernot to keep that point in mind with regard to the application of her amendment when we get to clause 41 because it certainly has application to the intent of the preamble, which is then going to be totally enforced by its application in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other tenets outlined right through this comprehensive and detailed preamble that do have further impact and I give the minister notice that as we proceed through the bill a number of issues that will arise are, I think, related. For example, in the area that relates to onshore waters, the land between high and low water is to be subject to claim and, consequently, any activity in these zones, such as pipelines or pearling, could well be thwarted. That similarly, as I said, affects clause 16 and also a Greens amendment to clause 238. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the issue of renewals, which will arise in clause 24, for example when a mining lease is in existence for, say, 50 years and it comes up for renewal, governments will have to pay compensation to ensure that that activity proceeds. Again, we are not alerted at any stage here to the enormous economic implications that will have for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in clauses 34, 36 and 37, where there are issues to be considered, the bill potentially allows for endless negotiation. Certainly the Northern Territory experience under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act has been that we ought not have an open-ended loop in the process of negotiation that constantly goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a need to address the issue of the replacement of state environmental assessment processes that will arise and how those processes are affected. I note that the Greens are proposing an amendment in that area which will in effect amount to private royalties&mdash;again, impacts that come back to the preamble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to clause 44, which specifically relates to the Northern Territory and the McArthur River project, the Northern Territory is again singled out for special treatment. This has already been covered by other areas of the bill. Why, therefore, does that particular section have to be highlighted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pastoral leases that are purchased under the new land acquisitions fund, which is alluded to&mdash;a number of people have spoken to the proposals that will subsequently arise&mdash;will never be converted to native title in the Northern Territory because of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act and its draconian provisions. Again, that will need to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Native title land can never be subject to a debt recovery process. As a consequence, many of the laws of the land will be unenforceable on native title land. Again, these highlight financial implications that are quite major. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal process that is proposed in clause 64 is a mockery of normal, legal processes and again needs to be addressed. If we look at the area of fishing, which is caught up in clause 197, we see that the capacity of the states and territories to confirm ownership and control certain of its resources is said to be subject to provisions of this bill; for example; the control of waters. Compensation and negotiation may be required. I therefore see in that a number of unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens also have an amendment to clause 213. I am concerned that it has the potential, as I mentioned earlier today, to destroy the national parks system of the Northern Territory. It seems to be targeted and very specific and therefore does not meet the criteria that is established in the preamble of this bill of its equality of application. The Greens' amendment will attempt to make all titles of the Conservation Land Corporation unable to be validated. That has very serious implications and I would hope that the Greens will address that issue and perhaps consider backing off on that particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see a number of issues that arise because the preamble, by its nature, sets the tone.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter which I do not think adds anything to the legislation is in the third paragraph of the preamble. In the setting down of the history of dispossession, as it describes it, it basically blames successive governments for having failed to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders concerning the use of their lands. This takes us back to the makarrata-type promises that were made to the Aboriginal people by the former Prime Minister. It implies that the Australian government needs to make some sort of lasting, more equitable agreement. I guess it implies the wishes of many people in the Aboriginal debate to have a makarrata or a treaty with the Aboriginal people. This is something that has been anathema to me personally. </PARA>

If I want to read a preamble and interpret it in the way that I want to interpret it, I will. I do not really care what she thinks about how I interpret it. I am entitled to put my views here. I listened to her in absolute silence. I do not always listen to her in silence, but I did this time. I will put my views down. If she wants to keep going with her verbal diarrhoea, I invite her to please do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of a lasting and equitable agreement with the Aboriginal peoples, which to me only implies some sort of reference to a treaty or makarrata, is anathema. I think the best solution for Australia and the best way for Australia to go forward is to ensure that we treat all Australian citizens, regardless of their race and regardless of the colour of their skin, as Australian citizens. We do need to recognise that many Australian citizens do suffer disadvantage and that many Aboriginals do suffer disadvantage. But if we want to overcome that disadvantage, we do not go about creating laws that are based on race. This legislation is one of the worst examples of that sort of law that has come before this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble goes on to talk about the decision that the Australian people made back in 1967 to amend the constitution. It says that the Australian people agreed that the parliament would be able to make special laws for the peoples of the Aboriginal race. Of course, that referendum had nothing to do with making special laws for Aboriginals, but it did confer upon the parliament of Australia the power to make laws for Aboriginal people. The preamble goes on to say that the High Court rejected the doctrine of terra nullius for Australia. It is fair to say that that is one interpretation of the High Court's decision, but it is an interpretation that is hotly contested by many more eminent lawyers and thinkers on this subject than me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, if one is to look at the strict narrow interpretation of the doctrine of terra nullius as saying that Australia was a land belonging to no-one, as Senator Kernot said, the fact that Aboriginals occupied Australia prior to European settlement is absolutely indisputable. Of course, that is not what the doctrine of terra nullius incorporates. To that extent, the preamble again does not have my agreement. I guess it is only a grammatical point, but I note that the preamble goes on to say that the people of Australia intend to rectify the consequences of past injustices. The people of Australia have not had an opportunity to pass judgment on these matters and, at least in the next few years, there will not be a referendum on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Bishop said during the second reading stage, if the debate over the consequences of Mabo No. 2 and the consequences of this legislation and the various pieces of states legislation goes the way we predict&mdash;being tied up in constitutional fights in the High Court for years to come&mdash;perhaps it may be a good thing that the people of Australia do have the opportunity to vote on these issues at a referendum at some stage in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wrong to say that the people of Australia intend any of these things because just about every published opinion poll of the Australian citizens shows that they are strongly opposed to the federal government intervening in these matters of land administration which are properly the responsibility of state governments. They certainly do not intend for the parliament and for the government to take these actions, so it is a stupid thing to say in a preamble that the people of Australia intend these things. If the people of Australia were asked whether they intended these things, they would tell the government `no'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter that I will raise in this discussion of the preamble is the special fund to be established to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who `have been dispossessed of their traditional lands' and where native title has been extinguished due to valid acts. We have asked Treasury, we have asked Finance and we have asked ministers in this chamber how much money would be going to this special fund and how this will be paid for. It is a very valid question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know my colleague Senator Short has asked these questions at estimates committees as well. Australian citizens do have a right to know how the money will be raised, what sort of Mabo levy will be applied to the Australian people, and whether the money that will pay for this lands acquisition fund&mdash;or the `special fund', as it is called in the bill&mdash;will be raised by way of a new levy, or a tax surcharge, or an increase in taxation, or a broadening of the sales tax base, or an increase in borrowings. The Australian people have a right to know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date the government has been extremely silent not only on how it is going to pay for the potentially enormous sums involved in compensation, which we know have to be paid, but also on the funds that will go into the special fund. It would be helpful to the Senate and to the people of Australia if the government were able to advise us on the way it is going to raise these funds, the amount we are looking at, and what the Australian people should be expecting to pay in terms of taxation, levies or surcharges to fund this additional expenditure. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have been progressively dispossessed of their lands.</PARA>
<PARA>While it is a known fact that the Aborigines were dispossessed of some of their lands, they also voluntarily left a lot of their land. If honourable senators do not believe what I tell them, I will once again quote from an article written by former Senator Peter Walsh who was in this place for a long time; he had a balanced view of these matters. In his article, he reminded us of a very worthy long-time member of the Western Australian parliament, Bill Grayden, who probably did more for Aborigines than any other parliamentarian in Australia, including our good friend Ernie Bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the article, in the 1950s Bill Grayden and his brother, who was also a member of parliament at the time, ventured into the area around Warburton in the western desert in four-wheel drives and discovered the Pintubi people who were supposed to have belonged to the area. In time, most of those people moved out and into a better situation. Senator McKiernan can smile as much as he likes, but it is history that the Aborigines left the western desert because they found it much easier to live in a similar situation to white people around Warburton. The population increased in the area around Warburton, because the Aborigines had a stable source of food and were able to multiply more. The young ones lived with the others in the western desert. Peter Walsh states in his article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 census data shows that Aborigines in Victoria and Tasmania, the most thoroughly "dispossessed", have much higher incomes, significantly longer life expectancy and a better education than Northern Territory Aborigines&mdash;the least "dispossessed". . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is his finding, not mine. I believe that he is correct. Peter Walsh further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Western Australia, an analysis of an ABS census data showed a very strong inverse correlation between income and the  propensity to speak an Aboriginal language at home. (Brunton, October `93.)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this is terribly surprising. The relatively affluent and healthy Aborigines are those with the highest level of socio-economic "assimilation". It is politically incorrect to say that, but what are our objectives: the material wellbeing of Aborigines&mdash;or feeling good about ourselves?</PARA>
<PARA>Those are very true words. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost certainly there is a higher proportion of part-Aborigines in the more affluent groups&mdash;a function of the duration of the association with white Australia, not biological inheritance.</PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, those statements are not politically correct these days. I use those points to disagree with the part of the preamble which states that all Aborigines were dispossessed of their lands, because it is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA>Page 2 of the preamble, which Senator Kernot also read out, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders have become, as a group, the most disadvantaged in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>I totally agree that they are amongst the most disadvantaged.

Things like the just terms compensation provision, the tribunal process and the land fund, together with provisions like the conversion of Aboriginal pastoral leases and setting constraints on extinguishment that might otherwise conceivably be applicable as a matter of common law so far as future mining leases are concerned, are all examples of particular measures that obviously confer particular advantages, and unashamedly so, given the history of disadvantage of Aboriginal people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the international convention and the Australian Racial Discrimination Act, which is based upon it, set a notional time limit in the sense of the enjoyment of special measures and benefits.

This addition to the bill was sought by the state of Victoria which wrote to the Commonwealth saying it thought it was appropriate that the Commonwealth's intention, so far as financial compensation is concerned, be made explicit in the terms of the legislation. This is the sort of thing that could have been done by executive agreement but the legislative provision sets out the framework for determining that assistance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis as the implementation of the bill takes place, and the Commonwealth was perfectly happy to accede to that request from the states. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Gareth Evans has said, amendment No. 40 is the more important of the two amendments. Amendment No. 40 seeks to introduce a completely new part 8A into the Native Title Bill. Part 8A is headed `Financial Assistance to States and Territories'. As the minister explained, amendment No. 2 amends clause 4 of the bill which attempts in a tabular form to broadly summarise the content of the whole bill. Amendment No. 2 amends clause 4 to insert a summary description of the new part 8A into the tabular format outline. The amendment to clause 4 says that the proposed new part 8A:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . provides for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements for the provision of financial assistance to States and Territories that have validated past acts.</PARA>
<PARA>In essence, this new part 8A seeks to insert into the bill for the first time a provision whereby the states and territories can look to the Commonwealth for financial assistance to meet the compensation costs arising from the validation by a state or territory of past acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are only two of 74 amendments that the government has circulated in the last 24 hours and there have been additional amendments since. These are amendments to the government's own bill. This is a classic example of the government's absolute incompetence in handling this matter.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supplementary explanatory memorandum specifically says that none of the 74 amendments, not even the new part 8A, contains any financial impact. I must say that I find that quite extraordinary. I hope that the minister will be able to enlighten us on that in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at least two extraordinary aspects to amendment No. 40. I understand the reason for it being introduced. Nevertheless, one has to look at the wording of it to make a clear judgment on it. The first point is that this proposed new part was not included in the bill in the first place. I do not really understand how that could be. In his second reading speech, in relation to compensation, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where compensation is owed to native titleholders for validation of past grants, it will be government, not the grant holder, who pays. We recognise that the Commonwealth should make a proper contribution towards compensation costs. We will have further discussions with the states and territories willing to join with us in this national approach, as well as on cost sharing for the legal and administrative regime.</PARA>
<PARA>He talked about compensation at the time of the council of Australian governments meeting earlier in the year when he was trying to negotiate a deal with the states and territories on Mabo No. 2. It was there all the time, and I find it extraordinary that part 8A&mdash;more accurately and appropriately drafted than the part 8A now being introduced&mdash;was not included at all. That is the first aspect of this amendment that I find quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I find it quite extraordinary that the government claims that it will have no financial impact. Since when does a new provision for financial assistance have no financial impact? The logic of that is that the Commonwealth must envisage making no contribution at all to the compensation payments made by states and territories. Clause 19(3) of the bill says quite clearly that so far as past acts validated by a state or territory are concerned, the compensation will be wholly met by the state or territory itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinarily confusing. Obviously, the Commonwealth is not envisaging paying no compensation to states or territories for past acts validated by them. One of the great criticisms and concerns that the coalition has about this whole bill is that, looked at in total, it really just provides a blank cheque to the government with no indication at all of what the costs are going to be to the taxpayer or anyone else for that matter&mdash;the states or territories, the Commonwealth and taxpayers generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Campbell commented earlier, there is no idea of the cost of compensation and there is no idea how it is going to be funded. Perhaps one of the reasons for the resignation of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) during dinner  time tonight is that he has suddenly realised what he has on his hands, potentially, with this legislation&mdash;it appears to be a totally open-ended cheque. I hope that the government in the course of the committee debate will try to give the Senate some indication of what the costs will be. Part 8A is only one small part of the compensation cost. It is quite inconsistent to have part 8A included in the way that it is and, at the same time, to say in the supplementary explanatory memorandum that these amendments will have no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of part 8A presumably stems from the remarks and statements made by the government, particularly the Prime Minister, over many months. They have changed their minds from one day to the next. I accept the minister's statement at face value that the idea is included at the behest of the Victorian government, but I would be very surprised if the Victoria government had a hand in the drafting, because it is very sloppy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the amendment actually mean? What are its implications? I have mentioned the cost element. I am reinforced in the remarks I made about the open-endedness and the vagueness of it all by the fact that, at the first COAG meeting, when the Commonwealth tried to talk the states and territories into a deal, my recollection quite clearly is that the Commonwealth was offering 100 per cent compensation to states and territories if they signed up on the dotted line there and then. But when the states did not turn over and say, `Tickle my tummy', the 100 per cent compensation reimbursement offer was jettisoned and replaced with a 75 per cent offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill itself made no provision whatsoever for Commonwealth reimbursement. On the contrary, clause 19(3) specifically says that the compensation is payable by the state or territory. This amendment is presumably designed to correct that, but what will it do? It does contain very vague and equivocal wording indeed. First of all, it gives no guarantee whatsoever that the Commonwealth will compensate a state or territory. The new clause 191A(1), which is the essence of part 8A, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commonwealth may enter into a written agreement with the State or Territory for the provision of financial assistance to that State or Territory &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in relation to the compensation cost. I note the word `may'. It does not say that it will; it simply says that the Commonwealth may. It gives the Commonwealth the power to do so, but it does not give a requirement that it do so. So there is no guarantee of anything at all there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the Commonwealth does agree to provide financial assistance, there are no limits at all in any direction as to the amount. There are no percentage limits. It could be five per cent; it could be nought per cent; it could be 100 per cent. There are no dollar limits either. In other words, there is total uncertainty about the real meaning of the provision when one looks at the hard print. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will the amount be determined? These are some questions that I hope Senator Gareth Evans will respond to. How will the amount be determined from one case to another? Will there be any limits? Will there be any regulations that will give us more specific guidance on that? They are all very legitimate and important questions that I hope the government has some answers to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as those points of detail, there is equally a problem of very considerable magnitude with respect to the wording of part 8A. I refer in particular to clause 191A(2), which says that the financial assistance will be subject to conditions. The clause states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial assistance is to be provided on such conditions as are determined by the Commonwealth Minister and set out in the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>So there are two points: the first is that the assistance will be conditional. One gets no prizes for guessing the answer to the second point. Who is going to be the sole determiner of the conditions? The answer is that obviously, given what happens under this government, it is the Commonwealth minister. The Commonwealth minister alone has the sole power of determining the conditions. Not only can and will the minister impose conditions, but also the conditions themselves are not required to have anything at all to do with the native title itself. They could relate to the state's or territory's education system, health system, transports system or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing at all in the bill or in the wording of this amendment to tie it down to the situation related to the bill itself. In essence, that means that this clause is potentially a Trojan Horse to a major increase in the Commonwealth's power over financial assistance arrangements with the states in that it would both directly, but more particularly indirectly, enable an enormous increase in the tied grants power of the Commonwealth in respect of the states. The most centralist power that any federal government could have over the states is the ability to tie its financial payments to the states to particular conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come back to that a little later on, if I may. But I will cease there. I ask the minister to respond to the following questions that I posed: how will the compensation payments be determined; will there be any conditions; are there any upper or lower limits&mdash;in other words, how will we get some certainty into this?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short ought to be familiar enough from his previous experience in financial administration to know that payments to the states for special purposes are always subject to appropriate conditions. What those conditions will need to be will depend entirely on the terms of the federal-state financial agreements as their substance evolves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very much a broad outline framework provision. It does not purport in any way to get into the detail of how those financial agreements will work. They are intended to be agreements, after all, properly negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states and one would expect the normal sorts of considerations that apply to Commonwealth funding in the context of such agreements to apply. I cannot be more specific than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the absence of a financial impact statement and the absence of reference to negative or any financial impact for this, the point is that these provisions are not self-executing. There is no automatic financial obligation associated with the mere existence of this particular statutory provision. It does depend upon agreements being entered into with the states. Those agreements, in turn, are expressly conditional, as the clause makes clear, on the state or territory in question validating past acts. It is clearly only in an environment of cooperatively moving the game forward that it is anticipated that agreements of this kind will be able to be reached. Agreement implies agreement on both sides and that implies some common approach and some willingness to approach the issues in a complementary and cooperative way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because there is that uncertainty of just what sorts of agreements will be implemented, and with whom over what time period, because that will depend on the capacity of the two sides to reach amicable agreement, the clause has no direct or immediate financial impact, although obviously there will be a significant financial impact in due course flowing from those agreements when they are reached and implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the quantum of that financial impact in due course, it is simply not possible to do more than offer very broad brush guesstimates. We had exchanges about this during a series of question times in past weeks and I am afraid that I cannot add anything more to those exchanges at this stage. The quantum of the degree of the Commonwealth contributions, compared with any possible state contribution, in percentage terms is not something I can comment usefully about at this stage. That is a matter for ongoing discussion and negotiations between the Commonwealth and the states, between the Prime Minister and the Premiers, and there is nothing much more as a result that I can usefully add to the information base before the chamber at this stage. </PARA>

After all, only $6 million has been set aside at this stage for the implementation. But I find it very peculiar that the minister cannot give a better estimate.

He will be familiar with the standard expression in the constitution itself under section 96 so far as financial grants to the states are concerned. They have to be under such terms and conditions as the parliament thinks appropriate. He will equally be familiar, from his previous experience in financial administration, that when grants are made in the context of particular agreements for particular purposes, the conditions may well include provision that the money be spent for that particular purpose, just as a normal method of ensuring appropriate financial accountability and conformity to the rules that govern these things.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been accused of littering the landscape with excessive amounts of amendment paper but I think that is one amendment which, to be perfectly frank and fair to Senator Short, is quite unnecessary. We are talking here about agreements that will be entered into between the Commonwealth and the states. They will be entered into and administered in good faith. We see no need for such an amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (8.31 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just wanted to put on the record&mdash;because Senator Gareth Evans has gone to some length to say that the government will act in good faith in these matters&mdash;that this government, in relation to its negotiations with the Western Australian government, has shown no good faith whatsoever since June last year. Senator Short has raised an important issue of the Commonwealth intervening in state affairs using tied grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only in October of this year, there was an example where the Commonwealth included for the first time in a draft for the renewal of a landcare Commonwealth-state agreement, I think it was, which it put to the Western Australian government&mdash;I do not have it in the chamber with me; it is back in my rather extensive Mabo files in the office&mdash;a clause which one could consider to be a condition of the Commonwealth funding the landcare project that was under consideration. The condition was that, in the Commonwealth's words, the agreement would be subject to the state government recognising either the Mabo decision or the existence of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one example of the very concern that Senator Short has raised where the Mabo issue is intervening in a range of Commonwealth-state affairs. It actually contradicts exactly what Senator Gareth Evans told us; there is no good faith there. The federal government will not only use its financial power in respect of this legislation but also in just about any area into which it can intervene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has had a total lack of faith in the state premiers. It is fair to say that the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made a genuine attempt&mdash;even after his famous Boyer lectures where he suggested that the states should be abolished and that we should set up regions&mdash;when, after many years in office, he saw the wisdom of a strong federation and sought to do something constructive about it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Mr Keating used the federal-state financial relations reforms that Mr Hawke proposed to undermine Mr Hawke's leadership. Mr Keating is an avowed centralist. He does not like the states. He does not like the Senate. So he will do and does everything that he can to undermine the state governments. He has done more in the last two years than any other Prime Minister in the history of Australia. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did indeed. The real thing that the people of Australia must understand is that the government knows that it cannot abolish the Senate and it cannot undermine the states through referendums or any democratic process. So this federal government under Mr Keating, who is an avowed centralist, is using every surreptitious means possible to undermine the powers of the states. It is doing this in the areas of health, education and now land management by using the power of the purse to rip tax funds off Australian citizens and then to hand the money back to the states in the form of tied grants. Again, we have an example of it here in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point of my contribution tonight is to inform the Senate that what Senator Gareth Evans has told us tonight is not true. The federal government is already using native title as a Trojan horse to intervene in many other areas. There is a document floating around the building&mdash;my colleague Mr McLachlan may have tabled it in the House of Representatives in October&mdash;which is a landcare agreement in which the Commonwealth has put a condition that the state government recognise the existence of native title, or some other such clause. That is an example of an agreement that has absolutely nothing to do with either the Mabo High Court decision or native title. </PARA>

It is crazy stuff, and those opposite know it is crazy stuff. They say, `That's well and good but, furthermore, we'll make the parliament sit on Saturday'. Parliament has not sat on Saturday for over 30 years for very sensible reasons: because we cannot expect the workers in this place to work from Monday to Friday and then to sit through Saturday as well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to raise with the minister and get a response to is this. When Senator Hill was putting some points to the minister about the consideration that he has given to the staff in this place&mdash;I will not go through all those again&mdash;he was interjecting over the table. Senator Hill was making the point about the transport arrangements and the minister is well aware of, as I understand it, the difficulties in getting not just senators home&mdash;we can look after ourselves in one way or another&mdash;but the staff of senators who happen to be here. Senator Hill was asking what arrangements the minister had made. What was the minister's response in interjecting over the table? It was: `Well, pass the bill tonight'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to hear two things from the minister. Firstly, does the minister consider that that is genuinely an appropriate response when dealing with such an important matter of legislation? The way he wants to get it through is by setting up such a timetable of inconvenience, not just for us but for everybody else, that he will in that way try to blackmail people, in a sense, into giving in because of the inconvenience it creates to the staff in this place and to our own staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, since the minister says, `Well, we hoped we could get this through and that there would be some sort of orderly debate. It will be all right and we can finish at half past 5 in the morning or perhaps 6 o'clock and people can get on these planes that start at 6.55 a.m.', when he is making those remarks and responding finally, perhaps he would like to address his mind to, and in his comments tell us, why it was that it was not until around 4 o'clock that we could get a proper list of the government amendments in the order in which it wanted to deal with them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans cannot come into this place and say that we have been holding the government up on this debate, that the delay in this is all our fault. We have been discussing a whole range of things, listening to his people babble on just to fill in the time so he could get his act together. What he has forgotten to mention as one of the key reasons in the delay here, one of the reasons we are here tonight and probably going to be here on Saturday and perhaps Sunday, is that whoever is responsible for the conduct of this bill in this place&mdash;I take it to be the minister&mdash;has not managed to get it altogether, simply has not managed to get it done so that we could deal with the amendments in an appropriate fashion. He was not able to do that until some time around 4 o'clock today. Now he is in here at 9 o'clock, four debating hours later, saying, `This is going to take a lot longer than we thought', and presuming to blame those of us on this side of the chamber. Perhaps he will address his mind to both those matters when he does have the chance to respond. </PARA>

The first is that the government, the Democrats and the Greens go around this country trying to tell people that the opposition in the Senate is being obstructionist. They know that that is not the case. They tried to have people believe that we held the budget up when in fact the reality was that the government got its budget in faster time this year than it ever has before.

Then the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised to have it in September, then October and finally we got it just before Christmas. The minister needs to inform this chamber and the people of Australia why we need this legislation before Christmas day. Is it because Santa Claus is going to bring it and drop it down everyone's chimney? Do we have to have it passed so that everyone can get a copy of it in their Christmas stocking? What is the relevance of Christmas day? What is the importance of getting it finished now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are back here on 1 February. We know that this is a piece of legislation that is fraught with problems.

We were presented with this scribble at 4 o'clock this afternoon and I want to show the people of Australia how disorganised the government is. I know from previous incorporations I have made that it is technically possible for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to incorporate this and I seek to do so, so that it stands as a monument to how disorganised the government's program is and what a hopeless, ad hoc piece of legislation this is and why, of course, this legislation does not need to be passed before Christmas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I came into this place on 1 June last year, and my first three weeks in this place were the last three weeks of the sittings. Except for Wednesdays, I think we sat until well after midnight every night of those three weeks. After my first three weeks in the Senate, I wondered whether any sanity ever prevailed in this place.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lo and behold, at the end of my first sittings, coming up to Christmas, we finished at 6 o'clock in the morning to catch a 7.10 a.m. flight to go home just one week before Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think Senator Crane was there when Senator Faulkner said that we will not be sitting until all hours of the morning. Not only that; he is now trying to bring in another arrangement which says that we finish at 8 o'clock at night, which I guess means that we will intend to finish at eight but still go until all hours of the morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Senator Evans's motion he has proposed that we sit until midnight tonight and then start again at 9 o'clock in the morning and sit until midnight on Saturday night. Like my colleague Senator Teague, I will not sit in this place on Sunday. I will not be here. I know that my colleague Senator Boswell feels the same way. There are still a number of people in Australia who believe that this parliament should not be sitting on a Sunday. </PARA>

How do we deal with checking this through the departments of fisheries?  Senator Evans walked in here at 5 o'clock or 6 o'clock tonight and threw down a whole series of issues that have constitutional import for the states. It is their right and their prerogative to give us advice, which should happen on a routine, normal working day. If Senator Evans had given us those amendments this morning at 9 o'clock, we would have had the opportunity to discuss them with our state colleagues and get advice, but we cannot do that on a Saturday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think honourable senators will recall that before dinner, in the committee stage of this debate, I made a comment that it was clear that there was a majority of senators who wanted to have this measure determined. Under those circumstances, I indicated that we should exercise our rights under the standing orders and the procedures of this place to ensure that all of the clauses, all of the amendments and all of the details of the legislation are properly explained so that senators are able to review the legislation, and that we ought to then sit on Monday, Tuesday and, if necessary, Wednesday to look at them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition that is before us at present is to sit tomorrow. Quite legitimate concerns have been expressed about the staff of this place and about our own staff&mdash;a number of other people who are not actually in this chamber.

I thought that we could have the Lord's Prayer and perhaps half an hour of bible readings, and perhaps every senator should start off their contributions with a verse from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the book of Job would probably be the one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The basic difficulty with the kind of proposition that Senator Harradine advances is twofold. One is the huge problem of getting any transport in and out of Canberra in the Christmas week for senators, even more so if the House of Representatives were to come back to endorse the bill that was passed. There is a huge difficulty in that respect, far more so at this time of the year than any other time of the year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Associated with that is the fact that quite a number of senators have other really quite substantial commitments next week which were made in an entirely reasonable expectation that next week would be free. Those commitments include, in a number of cases, overseas visits&mdash;not in my case, I hasten to add&mdash;and family holidays and things of that kind have been prepared, which simply makes life very difficult. Moreover, a not irrelevant consideration is the cost to the taxpayers of transporting people out of Canberra and back in a situation where that well may be able to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that I want to say is that it does need to be appreciated that, provided we do not waste too much time with procedural wrangles and carry-on of the kind that we have been engaged in for all too many hours today, it is perfectly possible to move through and debate properly the issues involved in this legislation within a reasonable time. I say that because the much maligned running sheet that honourable senators have before them makes the situation clear&mdash;and there has been an acceptance on all sides that that is an appropriate way of grouping the issues. It involves not 250 separate debates on 250-odd separate amendments. There are just 39 cognate debates proposed on the running sheet that honourable senators have in front of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my understanding that quite a number of the amendments that are listed in the different amendment sheets and that have been incorporated in the running sheet will not in fact be pursued. So it is quite possible to have a sequence of 39 separate, substantive debates on 39 separate, substantive issues in the time that we have available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I genuinely thought, because of the discussions that I had had and the cooperation that I had had with the leaders on the other side in a number of private discussions earlier in the day, that there was a real willingness on the part of those opposite to cooperate in debating, in a measured and expeditious way, the matters in issue. I also know&mdash;it as not appropriate to retail in this place private conversations&mdash;that it is the case that it was thought worthwhile in the discussions I had with those leading this debate on the other side to spend the time on getting the running sheet right, getting the amendments right, getting the paper flow right, in order to avoid much more substantial time wasting and difficulties in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am doing my best to organise this material in a way that it is able to be dealt with in the time available. I did, in a wild feat of optimism, believe that it might be possible&mdash;if we were prepared to sit very late tonight&mdash;to finish this and get out of here by early tomorrow morning, which would be an optimal result for absolutely everybody. It obviously did not prove to be the case. Under those circumstances, we took an early opportunity to make clear what the intentions were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do sit until midnight tonight and get quickly back to the substance of this bill, as I hope we can; and, if we do sit from 9 a.m. tomorrow and do sit until possibly late tomorrow night, it ought to be reasonably possible to deal with those 39 packages of amendments, all of which, so far, people have indicated a willingness to debate and to vote upon together. It ought to be possible to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are difficult and serious issues; they are complex issues. They have to be debated and some hours have to be devoted to them. but it ought to be possible in that time. If we set ourselves the target of doing it by tomorrow night, some of the problems that are being intimated need not arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to track back over the reason why the legislative program is as it is. We obviously have had difficulties all this session; we debated for only five hours actual legislation in the first three weeks of this session. There have been obvious problems in the conduct of this program in recent weeks. There are obvious problems with the fact that, quite apart from this Native Title Bill, we had nine major packages of legislation to somehow deal with as from yesterday afternoon through to today. They are all matters that those opposite wanted to debate and that they spent a lot of time contributing to the debate on. And that, together with the desire to get things in an expeditious fashion, has created the problem we have. But it is a soluble problem; if we would just shut up and get on with the business of debating this substantive legislation, we can solve this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as to the implications for staff, unhappily, it is only on a very selective basis that we hear concern for the staff in this place. We do not hear concern for the staff when people speak on the adjournment with sometimes multiples of people speaking for up to an hour or an hour and a half after this place gets up. We do not hear concern for staff when people do want to indulge themselves in debating endlessly pieces of legislation that simply do not need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the interests of the staff in this place would be much better served if we could debate reasonable hours and get our legislation finished in a reasonable time. But if the staff is asked what its preference is as between this week and coming back next week, I would be very interested to know what its response is. A great many people would very much like this session to be concluded, completed and for us to be out-of-the-way and out of their hair so people can get back to some degree of normality in their lives in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did raise with Senator Sibraa the problems involved in the mechanics of this place&mdash;the staffing, the personnel issues&mdash;that would be associated with having to run into tomorrow, which I hope very much can be avoided. I know that he, as the President of the Senate, who has been voted for by a majority of senators to exercise that role, which he does with great distinction, is concerned about this and has been taking every measure that he possibly can to minimise the staffing resources that will necessary to service tomorrow. That might lead to some inconvenience. I think that we all ought to be prepared to put up with that inconvenience if we are serious about recognising the position of our staff. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the view was that the crucial period in the implementation of this legislation would be the first years. During this period any bugs or flaws that did exist would be likely to show up. Five years is probably a fairly generous estimate of the time needed to scrutinise the implementation phase. It can always be changed if people think it is too long. The general principle of having sunset clauses for scrutiny committees of this kind&mdash;and, in fact, many other bodies&mdash;is a good one, as I think has been accepted on both sides of the chamber, because it forces us to reconsider the value from time to time of the particular organisational resource we have established.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Vanstone asked me earlier on what the implications of section 10(3) of the Racial Discrimination Act might be for those provisions of the legislation which relate to the possible vesting of native title in a corporate body. Senator Vanstone was referring to the provision of the Racial Discrimination Act, which talks in terms of the law containing a provision.

I think it is appropriate to debate this further when we get to the provisions about body corporate, but to the extent that it raises questions about the Racial Discrimination Act's application, that is the answer. These provisions are wholly outside any possible application of 10(3) of the RDA. </PARA>

I draw the minister's attention to that now and outline the concerns that we have so that when we do come to the point of debating this, we do not then have to postpone consideration because the Greens have not had a chance to consider the point.

It is just an organisational option that is available to a group of native titleholders should it so choose voluntarily that particular form of organisation. As we all know with blocks of flats and all the rest of it, we might have some common body corporate administering on our behalf, but we are all members of it with an equal say and we voluntarily participate in that particular process. I do not know whether that is the best possible analogy, but it is an example of the voluntary nature of what is proposed here.

It seems to me that native title is to be held by a body corporate, but the minister has said that there could be an amendment and that title could be held on trust by a body corporate or by a public company whose shareholders are the common law titleholders. There are a couple of questions that flow on from that.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that is the case, perhaps the minister can tell me whether he intends to move an amendment to the effect that title can be held by a single person or a combination of persons. What would happen in the case of succession; that is, on the death of the titleholder? If the title is to be held by a company whose shareholders are common law holders, will it be a private company?  I think a private company still has a limit of 50 shareholders. What would be the situation if the number of common law holders in a private company exceeded 50?</PARA>

<PARA>The relationship between this piece of legislation and the Racial Discrimination Act has a very interesting history. If it had not been for the Racial Discrimination Act, then possibly the Murray Islanders would not have been successful in obtaining the High Court decision in June 1992 because of its interaction with the actions of the Queensland government. Also, if it were not for the Racial Discrimination Act, then this legislation would not be being pushed through the parliament at this pace at this point in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision of June 1992 excited very little attention in the mining or pastoral industry because it was such a conservative decision. Basically, it held some good news for Aboriginal people, which was that it recognised the legal lie of terra nullius and acknowledged the existence of native title and prior occupancy of Australia by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bad news though, from the point of view of justice for Aboriginal people, was that the High Court decision also said that valid acts of state and federal governments were able to extinguish native title and, of course, had done so for 200 years. It was only the realisation that Australia is becoming a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the existence of the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 that caused the question mark of compensation to native titleholders to cause anxiety and concern to enter the commercial side of our community. This led to the clamour for certainty and validation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens feel that legislation based on the good news&mdash;the recognition of native title, the exposure of terra nullius as a lie and the effort to bring about reparation and justice&mdash;would have been a far more worthy basis for this present legislation. Nonetheless, it is that clamour that has been coming from the various interests in our community which are concerned that they may have to make reparation to native titleholders for the actions of the last 200 years that has led to this bill being pushed at the rate it has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to validate any titles that have been in doubt because of the action of the Racial Discrimination Act, then this bill is required and the Racial Discrimination Act has to be suspended because in actual fact native title rights are being removed by that validation process. That is the way in which the Racial Discrimination Act has been incorporated in this legislation, initially in the preamble as a special measure, and that the legislation has not been held to be in subjection to the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite the fact that the Racial Discrimination Act is enabling the validation of titles, it is important that the rest of the bill should not have the unintended effect of denying Aboriginal and Islander people protection against existing discriminatory laws, either state or federal. During the time when the doctrine of terra nullius was in force, a large number of discriminatory laws were passed. These laws are still in existence and could be used to authorise further discriminatory acts in the future. In many instances this could just confirm dispossessions that occurred under terra nullius and allow for similar dispossessions for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the concern that has been caused by the possible overriding of the Racial Discrimination Act has been a matter of considerable debate during the time that this legislation has been prepared. Proposed clause 6A relates to the inconsistency between this bill and the Racial Discrimination Act and is intended to provide that nothing in this bill affects the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is the parliament's intention that the bill should be a special measure within the meaning of section 8 of the RDA, if the bill is held not to be a special measure there is a risk that provisions of the bill may be construed as overriding the Racial Discrimination Act. Proposed clause 6A ensures that the bill, like all other laws, will be interpreted as not affecting the operation of the RDA and will thereby implement parliament's intention. Subclause (2) ensures that the validation of past acts by or in accordance with this act are not affected. That is the reason why this amendment is being proposed by the Greens. </PARA>

We have been concerned on the one hand that such are the benefits for Aboriginal people in the legislation that it might be construed as discriminatory against non-Aboriginal people.

It makes clear that the Racial Discrimination Act will apply to the provisions of this act and conduct carried out under it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I am intrigued that such a simple proposition, which one presumes has been put to the government constantly over recent months, has until now been rejected. I presume that is because the whole point of the government's reluctance was that there may well be unforeseen consequences.

Having regard to, but not being determined in our response by, the advocacy of Aboriginal groups, our belief is that the risk factors, if you like, associated with having a clause like this are not so great as to outweigh the utility of having a clear and resounding demonstration in the body of the legislation itself, not just the preamble, that we really do value the RDA and want to give it effective operation. </PARA>

If that happens, I am stating very clearly right now what the government's policy priority would be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although there are quite a number of other amendments moved by other parties which refer to further references to the Racial Discrimination Act, it is the government's intention to accede only to this particular clause here. We believe that this accomplishes everything that people want to accomplish in terms of getting overt recognition of the role of the RDA, and we do not need to repeat that in various other places throughout. So Senator Tambling should not assume, simply because things have been moved by way of amendments and they still appear on the running sheet, that they are going to be accepted by government.

<PARA>There is a very clear and explicit intention that the Commonwealth itself or states and territories, as the case may be, act to preserve these rights of public access. To the extent that that might intrude on some bits and pieces of native title in some locations, I think it is overwhelmingly likely that, if the point were ever made about the role of the Racial Discrimination Act in that respect, a court would hold that that is a reasonable restriction on the enjoyment of the native title in question&mdash;the fact that it has to be shared with the public in the context of public access. </PARA>

I think it is a very rightful concern that affects all Australians with regard to the access to all of their beaches. Whilst I appreciate the import of other aspects of what the amendment seeks to achieve, the minister did not comment on the issue that I addressed with regard to consultations or discussions in this area that the minister has had with either the Northern Territory government or, for that matter, other state governments. It has a very obvious consequence in those areas. We do not want to create a situation that will give rise to even more legal debate about the effectiveness of the bill and whether or not key elements are unenforceable in this particular regard. The minister also did not comment on what consideration was given in this part of the bill to those recommendations that were put forward by the Resource Assessment Commission's report into the coastal zone inquiry, which is also currently before the government.</PARA></TALK.START>

It operates to protect Aboriginal people against discrimination and it also operates to protect non-Aboriginal people against discrimination by pro-Aboriginal clauses in some contexts. One has to be, from both sides of the argument, very conscious as to what the implications are likely to be. We have been conscious. We made the judgment that this particular clause, on balance, has a useful declaratory effect without having any significant downside risks associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may not have made the Greens' point sufficiently clear when I moved this amendment. I presented the positive aspects of the inclusion of this clause in the bill which I felt were important. However, I should also point out that there are negative aspects to leaving it out. Without this clause, the bill itself that we are debating now becomes racially discriminatory. I ought to point out that all the rights that are being taken away in this legislation belong to Aboriginal people. They do not belong to anybody else. So there is no ground for non-Aboriginal people to be expressing concerns about it. It is because Aboriginal people have acknowledged that validation of existing titles is a reasonable issue for the non-Aboriginal community to address that they have allowed this particular bill to include that. Without a reference to the Racial Discrimination Act, other aspects of this will be discriminatory. So I cannot speak in stronger terms when I say that this legislation would be very flawed without such a reference.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated earlier that the body corporate provisions of the bill were under further consideration&mdash;and I did that in detail in answer to a question from Senator Panizza.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice is that, quite apart from considerations of that kind, the most direct answer to Senator Alston about the possible application of section 10(3) of the Racial Discrimination Act to any of this is that section 10(3) is about management of property, whereas the whole issue in terms of body corporate is not about management of property but  about simply being a vehicle for holding the title in question. That is why I had a sneaking suspicion my reference to body corporates for blocks of flats was an inappropriate example. Indeed, it is a particularly inappropriate example because body corporates for blocks of flats, by definition, are engaged in management functions on behalf of the individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very bad example because I am reminded that the intention of the body corporate provisions here is simply to have a convenient available reservoir, if you like, for the actual titleholding in question and for the convenient maintenance of that title over time. It is not intended to be a managerial body. It is just intended to be a titleholding body. I think that probably is the best immediate answer to that concern. That probably answers Senator Vanstone's concerns also, if that is right. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an answer anyway to the point that Senator Alston was expressing about the operation of section 10(3) of the Racial Discrimination Act. The answer is one that I have already given and it is not contingent upon this drafting exercise. That answer is that section 10(3) of the Racial Discrimination Act is about discriminatory impact on management. Since it has never been intended that the body corporate exercise itself a managerial role but simply be a repository for the title, the question, as I have just said in my last contribution, simply does not arise about the applicability of 10(3). So there is no Racial Discrimination Act question, as we understand it.

That is the reason why there is no question of the kind of management of the native titleholders of the kind that you are suggesting arises under the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act.

The point is that the committee recommended that it not have a Senate select committee hearing because it was too hard to get into those areas, yet Senator Kernot is prepared to sit in this Senate and move an amendment that retrospectively takes away the laws passed by Western Australia for remote areas of Western Australia where she is not prepared to go.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are not too many native title claims in Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra or Sydney, but in those areas of Western Australia that produce Australia's export income there are a lot of them under the hammer.

As far as I am concerned&mdash;and I am sure my colleagues in this place feel the same way&mdash;the process of land management must stay with the states.

Gradually, the other states have come out against the Commonwealth. They will wake up very soon to how the Commonwealth is trying to interfere with their legal and proper processes.

I am indebted to Senator Spindler for the time that he put into it. This is a late addition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say two things. Firstly, the principle of applying a law in a retrospective fashion is abhorrent; it has to be. It means that what was legal yesterday and what people did yesterday in the belief that it was legal can be made illegal today. We start on the basis that it is an entirely undesirable principle of law to apply. In fact, notable totalitarian regimes in recent history have employed it quite effectively. I have an absolute abhorrence of applying a law retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I appreciate that this argument might be raised. The Mabo decision came in June 1992 and the common law recognised native title. By backdating this law, we are not necessarily creating a new law because we are just recognising the Mabo decision in a retrospective fashion. That might hold some weight, but on balance it does not quite get up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 3 of part 2 of the bill talks about future acts. I do not think it makes any reference anywhere to, for instance, the Racial Discrimination Act. That occurs in division 4, but not in division 3. In his judgment, Brennan J said that a state government could extinguish native title as long as it abided by the laws of the Commonwealth&mdash;notably, the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;and it acted constitutionally. The High Court was saying, `There is native title, but it can be extinguished as long as it is extinguished properly'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brennan's judgment was regarded as the leading one. Two of the other judges, whose names escape me for the moment, followed his judgment on that point. This does not retrospectively apply the Mabo decision. If it did, it would recognise that one could extinguish native title in accordance with the Mabo decision. I do not believe that division 3 of part 2 of this act, on its own, reflects the Mabo decision. Taken in isolation, I do not think it covers all those points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem that this amendment runs into is that it applies specifics. The simple sentence that is in the present clause 10 says `in accordance with this act', and in one broad brush it encompasses the whole piece of legislation. But this narrows it down to division 3 of part 2 of the bill. That is where it runs into trouble. Quite frankly, it does not survive the criticism of it because of its retrospective effect. It is not retrospectively applying the law in accordance with the Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it is an attack on the states' ability to constitutionally deal with land management. It is a fact that land management was reserved by the state governments at the time of federation. They ceded powers to the Commonwealth. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reached the stage where the states had not ceded land management to the Commonwealth at the time of Federation. That might sound legalistic and a very dry argument but, nonetheless, it is one which carries weight and one that must be acknowledged. It is a constitutional argument and one which cannot be infringed. If it is, then the law is bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that this amendment takes this whole clause into more troubled waters. During the course of the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional there was evidence that the interference by the Commonwealth in respect of state jurisdiction in this area could cause constitutional problems. In fact, clause 7 says, in a rather vague way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act is not intended to affect the operation of any law of a State or a Territory that is capable of operating concurrently with this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The expression `capable of operating concurrently with this act' is rather vague. Does it mean that general laws pertaining to land management could operate but, as soon as they cross over into the native title area, they are inconsistent with the Commonwealth? But this bill may have consequential effects in respect of state land management systems. That is where the Commonwealth goes beyond the field it intends to cover . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause is a classic example of the Commonwealth overstepping the mark in relation to state jurisdiction. It is doing it in a retrospective fashion. I think this clause is ill-conceived.

If that advice has been obtained, can we have the benefit of it?</PARA>

There is no apology for that because we had hoped that it would be possible to get consensus nationally about this and we would all move together in the same way and not have a situation where a state does move to extinguish native title otherwise than through the proper process of compulsory acquisition. That has happened and it is necessary accordingly&mdash;and I do not think this is any news to anybody&mdash;to act in order to exercise our responsibilities as the guardians and protectors constitutionally of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the responsibility that we were given by an overwhelming referendum mandate in 1967.</PARA></TALK.START>

What would be the impact of this amendment on those particular bills? If we are going to pass an amendment like this, I think we are entitled to see whether we are overriding bills in virtually all the states. I would ask Senator Gareth Evans or Senator Kernot to provide the chamber with that information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of consultation with the WA government is an important issue because both the members of the government and Senator Kernot are misleading the people of Australia in relation to that matter. I would be pleased if the minister were to put before the Senate the facts as to the dates and times that the officers dealing with native title legislation from Western Australia were contacted by officers from the federal government in relation to those consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware of one specific example where a meeting was, I think, held in Brisbane back in either June or July, where the Western Australian Premier's office was contacted less than 24 hours from the time of a meeting being called to discuss an early draft of the legislation. That is the one example I remember, and I am sure there are others, but I will get the information from the premier's office and put it before the Senate, if Senator Evans does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that particular occasion, the Premier's office was contacted, and it was actually physically impossible for the officers from Western Australia to get to the meeting in time. There was a consistent pattern of behaviour from the federal government's officers which basically ensured that the Western Australians were kept out in the cold. That may or may not be the case, but I prefer to accept the word of the Western Australian government over and above that of this government. Perhaps Senator Evans has been misled by the Prime Minister again on this occasion. Perhaps Senator Evans was trying to tell the truth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy for that information to be put before the Senate. The other issue is the one Senator Spindler raised of whether or not the people of Western Australia want their own legislation to deal with this issue in their own way. Senator Spindler obviously knows better how to run Western Australia than the people of Western Australia or the government of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in a survey contacted by the Roy Morgan Research Centre on 8 December, a statistically valid survey by a very renowned and credible research organisation, Western Australian citizens were asked, `In your opinion, should the federal government's Mabo legislation be allowed to overrule the WA state government's Mabo legislation or not?'. Sixty-six per cent of those people surveyed agreed that the Western Australian state government's Mabo legislation should not be overruled, and 27 per cent agreed with Mr Keating's proposal&mdash;a phenomenon result, but Senator Spindler probably knows better than those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is astounding that someone who calls himself a Democrat should think that the people of Western Australia are mistaken on this matter. They have seen the way this federal government behaves. We heard Senator Evans saying earlier that he thinks that land management issues are the correct concern of state governments, essentially, except if they get it wrong&mdash;except, essentially, if they do not do something the Commonwealth government does not want them to do. That is the position taken by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think from the way the Democrats behave in these matters that they do not just do their consulting in dark rooms and the hallways of Parliament House with the government; they actually spend most of their time sitting in the caucus room with the government. Perhaps it would be a lot more efficient and practical and sensible if the Democrats, instead of just signing off on next year's budget, actually sat in on caucus meetings. Perhaps they should join one of the factions of the Labor Party&mdash;not be the fourth faction over here&mdash;and go to caucus meetings, because they have blindly gone along with this government's taking over control of land management issues in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point to the Senate that the people of Australia will sooner or later pass judgment upon a federal government that so blatantly overrules not only the legitimate actions of a democratically elected government in Western Australia but also the wishes of the Western Australian people which are published almost every week in opinion surveys. It is astounding that the Democrats should ignore the views of the Western Australian people, but I am sure that the Democrats genuinely believe they know better and that they would prefer to run Western Australia from here in Canberra, 3,000 miles away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said by way of interjection earlier, Senator Kernot did not want the citizens of Western Australia&mdash;the Aboriginal communities&mdash;to have a say on this bill.

I know he gave me his considered opinion but I did not know whether that was the considered opinion of the advice that had been obtained.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dissenting report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and I refer to page 57, there is a quote from the Commonwealth submission to that committee which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth requirements need not add another layer to the approval processes in a State. The integration of existing processes with those required by the Commonwealth Bill is envisaged in the provisions for Commonwealth recognition of approved State bodies and processes. In this way the Commonwealth Bill can adapt national standards to the particular laws and procedures in a State.</PARA>
<PARA>That is clearly saying, let us not have two systems; let us have one system and it will all be ours. It will all be the Commonwealth's way and the state will then have to comply with the Commonwealth. This is exactly the point that I made earlier. One might think by looking at this bill that the states will have to comply with Commonwealth law on only one or two matters touching on native title, but the consequential amendments, and the consequential changes to land management in the states, will have a cumulative effect. At the end of the day, we will have largely Commonwealth control over land management in the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may well be the motivation behind the Commonwealth bill. I know the preamble purports to talk about social justice and other lofty ideals&mdash;and quite commendable ones, too. But when one looks at the effect of this bill, I query whether there is perhaps another agenda&mdash;that is, a Commonwealth agenda to mutilate and debilitate state control over land management. So in view of that quote from the government submission, I ask the minister whether or not that is a clear exposition of the Commonwealth's intent to make one system of land management in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made absolutely clear that it is not the Commonwealth's intention. We fully recognise the appropriateness of state control over land management. There are just certain limiting cases, and one of them is when states seek to act in a way that is completely discriminatory and against the proper protective role in relation to Aboriginal people, and that is what is in issue here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular legislation has been acknowledged, appreciated and understood by the other states to be a cooperative venture&mdash;a product of a consultative process. There is only one state that is acting manifestly against this spirit, and Western Australian legislation destroys, as it purports to do, with a sweep of the legislative pen the concept of native title, turning it into a statutory title, which is far less effectively protective in its character, which is subject, for all practical purposes, to ministerial whim to the extent that its exercise is something which we just cannot consciously and conscientiously live with, given the responsibilities that we have, as a Commonwealth, under the constitution, to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of this country. We make no apology for seeking to exercise that responsibility in a way that the opposition has failed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to interfere with land management generally.
