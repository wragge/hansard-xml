<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the purpose of my private members amendment Bill is to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament, independent of the government. This is a necessary step to achieve a proper relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the United Kingdom, Canada, United States and certain other countries, it is accepted that there is also a relationship between the external auditor and its client, the parliament, for the provision of measures required by the Auditor-General to effectively perform his functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to reinforce the desire for independence parliament has the responsibility for determining the appropriation of money for the performance of the function of the office of Auditor-General. In terms of its relationship with the government, the office has historically stood somewhere between the parliament and the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Audit Office fulfils a very important function in scrutinising how government bodies conduct themselves, its operation has not been free of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an inherent conflict between the desire of executive government and its bureaucracies to operate free of constraints, and to some extent accountability, and the desire of those who provide the wealth for these operations, the citizens of Australia represented by the parliament, to remain informed of what those in government are actually doing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There must be an expert, impartial source to provide auditing of expenditures of government departments and bodies on behalf of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1989 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts argued in Report No 296 `The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and the Parliament' that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a strong Audit Office is essential for the maintenance of accountability of Federal Government organisations and officials to parliament:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the statutory relationship between the Auditor-General and the parliament, unchanged since Federation, needed major revision to reflect both the evolution of government over that period as well as the evolution in the role of audit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee, finding that the Audit Office had at best major problems and at worst was in a state of crisis, intended to add meaning to parliament's status as the Auditor-General's client through the establishment of a better foundation for relations between the Audit Office and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two examples of the problems besetting the ANAO were:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[1] resource constraints (Auditors-General Monaghan and Brigden have in the past complained about the effects of this on their independence); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[2] the fact that the ANAO "most important auditee", the Department of Finance, was the principal adviser on the Audit Office's resources. At present, the Audit Office must negotiate with the Department of Finance in relation to its funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Accounts Committee identified five reasons underlying the ANAO's problems, namely:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[1] Parliamentary complacency;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[2] the office fell between the two stools of the legislature and the executive, apparently with neither willing to take responsibility for the condition of the office;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[3] the lack of a mechanism allowing parliament to assume responsibility for the office;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[4] a previous over-emphasis on economy of operation by the Audit Office rather than on re-appraising its contribution to effective and good government; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[5] a lack of awareness of the importance of the audit of government activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The solutions that the Public Accounts Committee sought inter alia were :</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[1] explicit re-affirmation of the necessity for the Auditor-General to be free of political control;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[2] a new Audit Act establishing the Auditor-General as an officer of the parliament;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[3] the establishment of the Audit Office as a statutory authority;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[4] the granting to the Auditor-General authority to determine the terms and conditions of the employment of staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Needless to say, the parliament still awaits the legislation so revising the Audit Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been various other sources recommending a strengthening of the Audit Committee's mandate. The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has so recommended as has a previous external auditor of the Audit Office, Mr Michael Sharpe of Coopers and Lybrand.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of independent external audit of government bodies of whatever legal form and the reporting of such audits to the Parliament is crucial in assisting the Parliament to operate on an informed and effective basis. It is therefore an essential element of democratic government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General must not only be free of any influence or control in its audit activities and conclusions it must be seen to be so independent. Constituting the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament would contribute greatly towards this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill implements the will of the parliament, as articulated in the Public Accounts Committee report, that the Auditor-General be clearly created an officer of the parliament and so given a vital independence. I therefore urge all members of this chamber to support this bill.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Audit (Auditor-General an Officer of the Parliament) Amendment Bill 1993 is to make the Auditor-General an officer of the parliament, independent of government. In recent years a lot of political commentators have been concerned about the growth in the power of the executive at the expense of the parliament. This bill is an attempt to restore a better relationship between the two. Parliaments in other countries have a better relationship between their auditor-general and the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the recommendation of the public accounts committee in 1989, supported by all the major parties. The government has done nothing to implement those recommendations of 1989. Unfortunately, there has been an air of complacency on the part of both the executive and the parliament with regard to the status of the Auditor-General. Support has also come from the independent auditor and from all the inquiries that have taken place in relation to the Auditor-General's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Auditor-General suffers unreal financial cutbacks which have not necessarily been targeted against the current Auditor-General. In fact, the last three auditors-general in their reports have publicly reported on curtailment of their activities as a result of financial constraints placed on them by the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a strong Australian audit office for the maintenance of the accountability of federal agencies and officials to this parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to take note of the report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and a related bill, with Senators Watson and Kemp speaking for not more than 5 minutes each.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that what I have proposed was only sensible and reasonable. If this government was prepared to operate in a sensible and reasonable way, it would have given leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting President, as you are aware, the minority report relates to legislation before the Senate on a vitally important issue&mdash;that of fuel taxes, which will detrimentally affect all industry in this country. Certainly, it should at least be explained, and perhaps expanded on for a few minutes, by those committee members who have given so much time within the committee system of this parliament, to better advise the Senate. It is not only a matter of respect to committee members from within the Senate who have put in the effort but also to all of those witnesses who have been prepared to travel from far and wide to attend the Senate committee process in order that the parliament might be better informed in the debate that is to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How in those circumstances could it be unreasonable for members of the committee to get up in this place, the one chamber of the parliament that is really a chamber of debate, to explain their position? I am astounded that the government is not prepared to allow two members of the opposition who have put in minority reports on this critically important issue to explain their positions. I hope that the government, on reflection, will realise that the position that it is adopting is not a sensible position. I do not know what the government has to hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are matters that I think my colleague Senator Kemp might expand upon suggesting that members of the industry, in fact, are seeking negotiations with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on certain consequences relating to these fuel taxes. It may be those issues that the government does not wish to have expanded upon in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as part of the democratic process, following the government bringing down a budget, the constituency has a perfect right to put its case; it has put its case through the committee; members of the committee have now put in a minority report and they simply seek the opportunity of having a few minutes to explain that position. A more reasonable position one would have thought would be difficult to ascertain. I hope, therefore, on reflection the Senate will allow members of the committee the very short time frame that they have requested to put their case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, this is a most unreasonable suspension of standing orders from Senator Hill and it is a most unreasonable suggestion from Senator Watson&mdash;and apparently we will receive the same from Senator Kemp&mdash;to seek leave to speak at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sessional orders of the Senate on this matter are absolutely clear, as is the precedent, as is the way in which this chamber has operated on these matters since the reference of bills to committees orders of the Senate came into being on 5 September 1989&mdash;not opposed by anyone on that side of the chamber nor at the time when they were readopted on 5 May 1993. It is worth reminding the Senate of what the key sessional order says. Sessional order (10) says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That a report from a standing committee relating to a bill referred to it under this order shall be received by the Senate without debate, and consideration of the report deferred until the order of the day relating to the bill is called on.</PARA>
<PARA>There is ample opportunity for those senators who are members of the committee, or any other senator, to address the Senate on these issues. These bills were suspended at the first reading. There is any number of opportunities for Senator Watson, Senator Kemp and Senator Hill&mdash;hopefully, it will be limited to that number of senators&mdash;to express their views in the substantive debate we are going to have on these matters. That is the way the reference of bills to committees is supposed to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion to suspend standing orders and Senator Watson's proposal to seek leave in this matter are nothing more than an abuse of the processes and procedures of the Senate. It ought to be stressed that this has never happened before. Never before has any senator believed he needed to use this ruse to get up and speak to a committee report. Those opposite talk about an opportunity to speak for five minutes. Senator Hill said that they only want five minutes. There is much more opportunity available than that. To start with, there is the opportunity to make a 20-minute second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No reasonable person&mdash;and most of them are sitting on this side of the chamber&mdash;could come to any conclusion other than that this is yet another opposition filibuster, another attempt to waste this chamber's time. They know that is the case. All they are trying to do is delay the substantive debate. Let us have it. We are willing to have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very cooperative in terms of seeing these budget bills debated in the chamber and in the way we have managed proposals&mdash;for example, the notice of motion Senator Short has given. But we are not going to ride roughshod over these procedures because one or two senators want to make a five-minute contribution on a matter when they have ample opportunity to do so during the substantive debate on these bills at a later stage. This motion to suspend standing orders is a filibuster; it is a delay; it is an attempt to waste the Senate's time. I urge senators not to support this absurd, ridiculous and time-wasting motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion for the suspension of standing orders moved by my colleague Senator Hill. If ever we have heard a time-wasting filibuster, we have just heard it from Senator Faulkner today. If people want to know why this chamber does not operate in a more effective fashion, they would just have to tune in to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A request was made with a specific time limit. We asked for eight to 10 minutes for two speakers to make some brief comments on an extremely important report. We have already passed the eight to 10 minutes that this debate would have taken. The mishandling that we so often see in this chamber in the management of business has been further demonstrated today by Senator Faulkner's gross overreaction to a very straightforward and reasonable request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very common procedure in this chamber to seek leave to make brief comments on matters of importance. We set a specific time limit. The arrogance of the government in the way it treats this chamber and the parliament was demonstrated by Senator Faulkner's comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we sought to make some brief comments on this report was to make sure that the Senate was fully briefed on a number of vital and continuing issues which emerged from last Friday's hearing. Following the submissions made by a large number of industry groups, requests were made at the Friday meeting for further meetings to be held with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and relevant ministers to look once again at the issues which were raised at the hearing. I believe that those assurances were given. I thought Senator Schacht generally acted in a most constructive manner at the hearing, recognising that these bills contained some very real problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Nabalco submission presented by Dr Terence Gardner there was an assurance that there was a real problem and that a meeting would be organised with Mr Dawkins to deal with the very serious problem of the bauxite producer at Gove. There were also submissions from the shipping people. Mr Payne from the Australian National Maritime Association submitted an excellent submission and again sought further discussions with the relevant minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Collins said that the matters which were raised by Mr Payne were still under consideration by the government. Senator McMullan may not know that and that is why it is important that these particular points are brought forward in this debate. Officers from the National Transport Federation and the Road Transport Forum raised particular issues and sought further discussions with the government, Senator Schacht, Senator Kernot and the Green senators to bring their particular concerns to their attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that I have risen to speak&mdash;and I think it is important&mdash;is that, having received these assurances from Senator Schacht that he would do his best to facilitate meetings, I have had further contact with one of the groups. It has pointed out to me that it is becoming very difficult to organise an early meeting with Senator Schacht to consider the particular problems that its industry will be faced with. I hope that is not the case and I hope that Senator Schacht, when reflecting on the assurances that were given at Friday's hearing, will proceed to allow an early meeting. I refer in particular to the request of Mr Paul Gaynor from the National Transport Federation for an early meeting to put to Senator Schacht the impact on small business, particularly the long hauliers in road transport, that the fuel excise rises will cause them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very serious issues to be considered. Senator Watson and I sought to make these brief comments to bring to the attention of the Senate these particular concerns which need to be resolved very quickly&mdash;in the next couple of days&mdash;before we go on to the substantive bills. It was important for Senator Watson and I to make some brief comments. We have now taken up more time than would have been taken up had Senator Faulkner agreed to a very reasonable request. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion for the suspension of standing orders and, unlike Senator Kemp, I intend to speak to the motion. The comments that have been made are not relevant to the motion. The motion is symbolic because every time&mdash;we have seen it regularly recently&mdash;there is a negotiated agreement about the way in which the Senate's procedures should be run that becomes the new benchmark from which further concessions are sought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference of bills to a committee via a sessional order is not anybody's preferred option; it was a negotiated agreement between all the parties. We were not exactly happy with it, but we had to cop it. One part of the equation was that the reports come in without debate. That was one part of the equation of a whole balance of items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we start to tear that up, it becomes much more difficult to come to any future agreements. We know that as soon as we come to an agreement, the next day, the next week or the next month, someone will come and say, `Okay, on the basis of that agreement, we want to go a step further'. That is why we are concerned about this. It is not because of the particular matter; it is because of the general principle which has been a continuing cause of concern in respect of undermining every reasonable agreement we come to about the mode of operation of the Senate. We cannot continue to allow every one of them to be undermined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel certain that this did not start out as a filibuster, but it has the real potential to develop into one. Senator Watson has explained to me that he expected these bills to come on earlier. The bills are not coming on because the opposition has requested that they be dropped further down the list. So it is not the fault of the government, the Australian Democrats or the Greens that the order of business is as it is; it is as a result of a request of Senator Short and the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator McMullan and Senator Faulkner that some order is necessary in this place. We do not have much semblance of order most of the time, but I think it is fair that some order is necessary in this place. What Senator Watson wants to say can be said at the second reading stages of the bills. They have been referred before the second reading stage. If we choose to do this today, then we are saying that every time any senator writes a dissenting report about any bill to any committee we will extend the opportunity to that senator to make comments at this stage of the business. I think that begs the question: why just those who write dissenting reports? Why do we not allow every senator who is a member of a committee who wants to say something the opportunity to do so?</PARA>

But the fact of the matter is that the sales tax bills are coming up next at the request of the opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am certain that it was not meant to be a filibuster and while it is quite obvious that we have spent more time talking about why we should not talk about it than giving Senator Watson the four minutes&mdash;and that always happens when we move to suspend standing orders&mdash;the problem is the precedent and the extension of that precedent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. Dissenting reports are part of the system of checks and balances which are so essential in a parliamentary democracy. All too often in this place we see issues railroaded through. The guillotine process adopted in the House of Representatives is an absolute disgrace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all parliamentarians are happy about this railroading of legislation through the parliament. Those budget bills that will have the most significant impact on the Australian economy, and indeed our export income, are the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are these bills important? It is because they will wipe out decades of micro-economic reform in many industries across this country. They are particularly destabilising to those industries and people who live in remote and decentralised areas. They will wipe out decades of micro-economic reform to firms and industries in the inland and they will be devastating for coastal shipping and road transport. For that reason I sought the leave of the Senate for no more than four to five minutes to briefly outline the concerns in our minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we will have the opportunity down the track to debate it at the second reading stage if the guillotine is not called on. But the important point is that the minister has indicated that the government is prepared to negotiate. That is all very well for the government which through various mechanisms&mdash;some of which deny the constitutional validity of the proper passage of legislation through linkage processes and other techniques&mdash;wants to introduce a degree of frustration. The government will have to alter its agenda, as the minister acknowledged at the meeting when he said that we will have to enter into certain negotiations with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). The government wants to deny this parliament any opportunity even to speak of the right to change any aspect of that legislation no matter how detrimental it might be to industry and the Australian people. I hope that the motion for the suspension of standing orders put by my colleague Senator Hill will be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not just a question of the eight or 10 minutes that Senator Watson and Senator Kemp mentioned, and it is not a question of what we have to hide, as suggested in Senator Hill's earlier interjection. It is a question of the proper processes of dealing with the reference of bills to committees. As opposition members know, the government goes along with this process with some reluctance, but we have accepted the way in which the system works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally this system was to be primarily a substitute for the committee stage of bills. But once again we have accepted that, in a large number of cases and to help the timetabling of the consideration of legislation, many of these references should occur before the second reading stage. In this case it was done before the first reading had even been carried. So I do not think the opposition can say there has not been flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We acknowledge the numbers in here in regard to decisions concerning references of bills. Therefore, we do not use the numbers in the selection of bills committee to make recommendations on this sort of matter. But one key prescribed process for reports coming back from committees that have considered bills is that, as the standing order prescribes, there be merely a tabling of the report and no debate at that stage. That is very sensible, because the tabling of the report is merely a means of bringing the bill back on to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> of the Senate so that its next stage can be proceeded with. There is every opportunity for members of the opposition and everybody else to debate the various matters in the majority and minority reports at that point. There is no need to deal with the issue twice over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, it is not just a matter of taking eight or 10 minutes to discuss a particular bill. If two opposition members want to have a say, why cannot the rest of us have a say? We were not seeking to take up time at this stage. It does not concern just this bill. It means that, for the first time, there would be a change in the procedure that we have been using for the last three or four years regarding the reference of bills to committees. Senators would want then to have leave to make statements on a whole variety of other bills. It is particularly important that we draw the line at this point and say that we must not set a precedent and upset this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that we are not talking about normal reports from committees. In such cases a report is brought down and it is normal that a senator moves a motion to take note of the report, which allows members of the committee to have their say and for it to then be adjourned to the next sitting Thursday when committee reports get called on. We are talking about a quite distinct procedure in which bills are referred to committees in order to save time in this chamber. The theory of the matter was to save time in the chamber by having committees deal with bills. There is no point in our having that procedure and spending all our Fridays having committee hearings if we are then to allow the same procedures to take place in here, and then add to them by allowing speeches to be made when a report is tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that this process is quite different from the one that operates in regard to reports from committees on other references. It is an important part of the reference of bills to the committee process that the tabling of the report merely brings the bill back on to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> of the Senate for further consideration.

<PARA>The reason I am seeking to do this now is that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 and Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993 will not come on for debate for some little time. This is a matter that we believe the government and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) should take note of and act upon in the meantime. In other words, I could have sought to move a motion in these terms when the bills came on for debate in this place, but I suspect&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that the government would then suggest that my course of action was a delaying tactic, which it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report reinforces the concern that was expressed in its previous examination of the question of constitutionality. In our view, if there is any real doubt about the constitutionality of bills, it is the responsibility of the government to put them in constitutional form in order that this parliament might vote upon something that is likely to be sound. Furthermore, it is in order that whatever legislation gets passed in this place is unlikely to suffer successful challenge, with all the dire consequences to the economy that would follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That advice clearly came out of the first report of this committee which was the first consideration of the issue under the government's earlier Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill. The government took that omnibus bill away and redrafted it into some eight different bills. To some extent the government has acted responsibly on the committee's advice. What we on this side of the chamber find astounding is that the government did not go the whole way and put the constitutional issue beyond argument. Rather, what the government has done deliberately is that, first, it has sent back to this place a bill which the government accepts is constitutionally ambiguous in order that it might be tested; and, secondly, it has sent back to this place a bill which at least some members on the committee&mdash;the opposition members and the Democrat member&mdash;believe is of doubtful constitutionality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say that the government is wrong in relation to both bills. The second bill is the government's deliberate so-called test bill. We believe that it is improper practice to deliberately put before the parliament a bill which the government accepts might be unconstitutional in order that it be carried and then tested. We say sound parliamentary practice is to put the bill in an unambiguously constitutional form and then to expect the parliament to carry it on that basis. That is our objection to Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2), the test bill. That is demonstrated by the views of the opposition senators in this committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first bill, which I think the government believed was in constitutional form, the advice that is now given to the Senate by its committee&mdash;certainly by the opposition members and by the Democrat member&mdash;is that a significant risk continues. Therefore, it is our view that both those bills, in the few days that remain before this debate comes on in this place, should be withdrawn and redrafted into a constitutionally sound form in order that all the unsatisfactory consequences that could flow will not in fact flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a difficult challenge for the government to put its bills right. I think the estimates are that it might take a couple of hours work up to maybe a day's work. That is not beyond the government with all its expert legal advice to handle expeditiously so that when we do have the second reading debate of the bills in this place, they are in an unambiguously constitutional form. The Senate should be grateful to this committee, under the able chairmanship of Senator Cooney, for its ongoing contribution to ensuring good practice in this place. But I particularly rise to put to the Senate the opposition's argument that the government should withdraw both the first bill and the second bill&mdash;the so-called test bill&mdash;and redraft them so that they are clearly constitutionally valid. This would ensure that when subsequently we debate the legislation we know that we are voting upon something that in all likelihood is constitutionally valid. That is why I have moved this motion asking the government to withdraw and redraft these two bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Hill which, in effect, would mean that Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 and Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993 would be returned to the government. The government would be invited to redraft those bills so as to put the separate matters of taxation that are now contained in each bill into separate bills. The coalition requests the Senate to endorse this motion because we believe that is the appropriate way to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government originally put a vast range of tax matters into one bill. In my view, it was an extraordinary attempt by the government to blackmail the Senate and to deprive the Senate of functioning as a proper house of review by saying, `We, the executive, we who have won the numbers of the day in the lower house, have the complete and utter right to set the budget and therefore to run the country'. It flows that if the Senate has no say with respect to any of those matters, one wonders why the Senate is here. This attempt would simply strengthen the arm of the executive over parliament and reduce parliament's control by reducing the capacity of the Senate to influence the outcome of certain legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was referred to the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee, the members of which unanimously concluded that there was a real and significant risk that the High Court would hold that that bill imposed taxation on a number of subjects of taxation and would therefore be invalid under section 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in the other place saying that senators have no business considering this matter. We are apparently paid to come here and give no attention whatsoever to whether the legislation we pass is constitutional. The Treasurer seems to think that it is his role and not a function of a house of review to worry about whether legislation is in the constitutional form. I am sure the Treasurer has received the message from the members of the public, the taxpayers who fund this place&mdash;who fund senators and their staff&mdash;that they think the Senate does have a role, a right and a responsibility to ensure that it does not just pass legislation irrespective of its constitutional form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the Treasurer caved in, despite his froth and bubble and protestations, and redrafted the bills, except for one which was agreed to be a bill to test the proposition at hand, which is whether an increase in a rate of taxation is an imposition of tax. So there is one test bill and the others are intended to be valid. With regard to the test bill, the coalition does not think it is appropriate that the Senate be asked to pass a bill which it is agreed is of doubtful constitutional form. We especially do not think the Senate should ever contemplate doing that when the option of putting it into constitutional form is such an easy one to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pat Brazil, the former Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, gave evidence to the committee that a very competent draftsman would take half an hour or less to put that original omnibus bill into constitutional form. Only recently the committee was advised that to put each of the two bills we are now discussing into constitutional form would most certainly be less than one day's work for a competent draftsperson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is not, as the Treasurer would have us believe, that there is some sort of nightmare happening in the Senate, that the Senate is trying to block the budget or anything like that. We are only talking about a number of bills, in any event. What we are trying to do is ensure that they are put in unambiguously constitutional form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously true that if this Senate passes a bill which is unconstitutional&mdash;or possibly unconstitutional, to put the most positive light on it&mdash;that matter may well then be tested in the High Court and it might resolve that question. But we have the Treasurer and the Prime Minister going on television nearly every day referring to people here as unrepresentative swill&mdash;despite the fact that they have been elected on proportional representation, which one might argue is a more representative form than that by which the Prime Minister himself was elected&mdash;and basically saying that the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the budget packages is destabilising the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposition the government puts in that respect is correct, then there is a simple way to ensure that certainty: do not leave this doubt hanging over the test bill at all; withdraw the test bill, separate the two subjects of taxation, ensure we have constitutional certainty as to its validity and let the Senate deal with the matter as it will. Then we will resolve the matter quite speedily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. The government cannot be saying day after day, `We can't have the Senate dealing with these matters. All of the kerfuffle about this is causing concern', and then in the same breath come forward and say, `But we're going to devise a test bill, whip it up to the High Court, wait a couple of months and see what the outcome is'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the taxes referred to in the test bill do not come into operation until a later date, but the point being made by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister is that the financial markets want to know the outcome of this budget and they do not want to wait until after a High Court decision. If what the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are saying is true, the financial markets want the outcome of the budget to be resolved as speedily as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way to do that is to not fiddle around with test bills. The way to that is&mdash;having got the greater numbers in the lower house and, therefore, forming the executive&mdash;to put the propositions that you rightly want to put as part of the budget, put them in separate bills in unambiguously constitutional form, and see what the Senate thinks of them. That option is available to the executive; it is an option which would be available with less than a day's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this brouhaha and bleating through the media about obstructionism in the Senate is, in fact, of the government's own choosing&mdash;of the government's saying that it has the political right to package these bills as it will and to test things out in the political arena. That is of course right&mdash;it does. But if that is the way the government wants to play it, then it should not blame the opposition for joining in that game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on the other hand, the government simply wants to get its budget passed as best it can and it does not want to play politics with the budget&mdash;because that is the claim it has been bleating about on television&mdash;then it should put the bills in unambiguously constitutional form and give it a go. That is what we say in relation to the test bill. Those arguments equally apply to the first taxation deficit reduction bill which it is not agreed by the government has any constitutional doubtfulness about it at all. Those arguments apply and I will not repeat them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is worth pointing out why we say with respect to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 that there is constitutional doubt. Members of the public may well find it extraordinary that up until now the plain meaning of the constitution&mdash;the meaning as if someone in the street picked it up and read it&mdash;has not been applying; namely, that an increase in a tax rate, which means that people in the gallery are going to pay more, is not regarded in this place and, government senators would argue, would not be regarded by the High Court, as an imposition of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the gallery and members of the public who will have less money left to spend because they are going to be paying more tax in one way or another, find that extraordinary. If they are paying more tax, they think extra tax has been imposed. I do not think you would get very far in the front bar of a pub running the argument that an increase in a rate of tax somehow does not impose additional burden and tax. That is what it is all about. I understand there are fine legal distinctions to be drawn here, but that is really the nub of the argument. How far can we take some of these subtle distinctions before we end up being in an absolutely absurd situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The query with respect to this first bill, which the government thinks is constitutionally valid, relates primarily to credit unions. Credit unions at the moment pay tax at the rate of 33 per cent on a very small portion of their income. What the government is seeking to do by a number of clauses within this particular bill is take away the exemption from paying tax on a wide variety of income; that is, to say to credit unions, `You are now going to pay tax on a much broader share of your income than you ever have before'. Then it will introduce a new regime of tax at a new rate of 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the credit unions, which have been paying tax at 33 per cent on a very small portion of their income, now find, if this bill is passed, that they will be paying tax at 20 per cent&mdash;lucky them, a lower rate&mdash;but on a much bigger portion of their income. The government says, `Don't be silly. We are reducing the rate of taxation. You can't call that imposing tax'. And the credit unions are entitled to say, `Look, get lost. We will be paying much more tax if this legislation is passed. That is an imposition of tax by the combination of those clauses'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the government is doing. It is imposing more tax on credit unions. We say that there is some strength to that argument&mdash;sufficient strength to say that the culmination of those clauses may well be regarded by the High Court as imposing taxation. If the High Court were to say, `Yes, this is imposing taxation on credit unions', the other clauses in the bill that relate to other subjects of taxation, fringe benefits tax, Medicare or whatever&mdash;it does not matter&mdash;would necessarily fall over because one can deal with only one subject of taxation when one imposes tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a much broader view of what is an imposition of taxation than the one I have just put, namely, increasing a rate or imposing a tax where one did not exist before, one might argue that other clauses in that bill also would amount to an imposition, in which case the whole lot would fall over. Briefly, that was the argument that we put in relation to the first bill. Therefore, this bill, as much as the second bill, has this constitutional doubt over it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not trying to delay things here. We are not trying to cause trouble. People on the other side can resolve this matter with less than a day's work. Take both of these bills back and redraft them. Put the separate subjects of taxation into separate bills. If the government does not want to play politics with the budget, bring them back here and have each of the measures considered on merit. But if the government does want to play politics, if it wants to fiddle around packaging things up in doubtful constitutional form, it should wear the blame for that itself. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of what has been said already is true. For example, Senator Vanstone has said that it would be a comparatively easy task to redraft these bills. In other words, it is possible for the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) to be taken to the very competent parliamentary draftsmen and redrafted very quickly. As has been said, that would solve any constitutional doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that some very eminent silks have cast some doubt on the way the bill has been drawn. It is also true that the High Court, contrary to what had earlier in the century been thought to be the case, is prepared to apply section 55 of the constitution, as illustrated by the Mutual Pools case and by the Air Caledonie Internationale case. So much of what has been said opposite is true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very seductive suggestion that the problem can be solved simply by redrafting the bill, but there are matters that have to be put against that. I will start by talking about the constitutional balance between the Houses and what the Houses and the High Court can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem arises because of the way the constitution under which we all live has been written, in particular, sections 53 to 57. Those sections set up a process whereby the tensions that may exist between the two houses&mdash;that is, the House of Representatives on the other side of the hall and the Senate&mdash;can be adjusted. It is very much left to political play as to how matters will be resolved. If, indeed, the two houses cannot agree, the ultimate sanction is that we go to a double dissolution and come back here with a new parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Into this context, which was set up by the constitution to allow political play between the parties and between the chambers, came section 55 which required&mdash;and I think `required' is the proper word, too&mdash;the High Court to decide an issue that was raised before it. Firstly, it had to decide whether laws which imposed taxation dealt only with the imposition of taxation or whether they dealt with other matters as well; and, secondly, whether a law imposing taxation dealt with one subject of taxation or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the constitution has done is create problems which I think may not be properly resolved if we take what, in my view, is the seductive answer which has been offered by the opposition. If we in this chamber, in this parliament, pass our legislation, having regard, as we have at the moment, to what the High Court might possibly say, we will be very much confined in what we do and we may not be exercising the powers that we should be exercising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proposition has not only occurred to me, but also it occurred very much to some of the great founding fathers who wrote this constitution. As an example I quote from Mr Isaac Isaacs, as he then was, the Attorney-General for Victoria, who was attending the convention debates on 8 March 1898 in Melbourne when this issue of what was later to become expressed in section 55 was raised. He was answering a comment from Mr Holder who had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A measure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is a taxation measure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would be valid while it was a Bill, and invalid when it became a law.</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about a technical issue that is still in the constitution and which is not pertinent to the present debate. Mr Isaacs had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a very terse and correct way of putting it, and it proves the absurdity of the provision.</PARA>
<PARA>He opposed the provision which is now section 55 but lost the debate on that. He then made the comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are, in my opinion, making the Senate too strong a body. To allow these matters to be carried into the Supreme Court&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which was later named the High Court but in 1898 was referred to as the Supreme Court&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is to say that the Senate cannot protect itself, and that the states cannot protect themselves. Surely that is not to be thought of for a moment.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the part I want to emphasise:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want a people's Constitution, not a lawyers' Constitution. We shall be making the Supreme Court, not the master, but the tyrant of the Constitution, by inserting a clause of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I want to make is that the words that Mr Isaac Isaacs, as he then was, become quite prophetic to the present situation. We are now legislating on tax bills which, as Senator Vanstone and Senator Hill have said, are vital to the future good of this country, looking over our shoulders at what the High Court might do. What we are doing is trying to predict what the High Court might do rather than looking at what is good for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this side of the chamber might say is for the good of Australia is obviously quite different from what the coalition and the Democrats might say is for the good of Australia. But instead of debating that, or talking about the best way of structuring this budget, the best program and the best form of policy to put forward, we are debating what the High Court might do. We should be debating what we should or should not be taxing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Ellison, in his inimitable and very skilled way, were to get up and say, `Look, you should not be taxing at that rate', or, `You should be taxing something else', the debate would flow across the chamber on the basis of what people thought was appropriate for Australia as a whole. But we are not doing that. This very debate illustrates that we are debating what the High Court might do. Because we are fearful of what the High Court might do we may be confining the very powers that we should be exercising</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words of Sir Isaac Isaacs are quite true: in the present circumstances, we have a constitution which is not a people's constitution but a lawyers' constitution. We are not arguing as representatives of the people here today, we are arguing about what lawyers have told us might happen before the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to take into account what might happen with a bill that may contravene section 55. Clearly, if some bills are written in such a way that there is a very great chance that they will contravene section 55, they ought to be redrafted. I am not saying for one minute that we should ignore section 55, but there comes a time when we should not take any risk that might be presented to a bill which stops us from properly legislating, from properly drawing up a bill, that seems in the best interests of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not mind for one minute if the debate were that, because of the political situation, something should not be in this bill, that it should be in another bill. That is fair enough. But it is a matter for concern when we get to the position that we are in now where we cannot structure a set of legislation or debate it as we should because it might be affected by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has the duty to apply section 55 if it is there, but the High Court itself is conscious of the sorts of things that I have been saying. Things become clearer if we look at what is called the `second fringe benefits tax case', the State Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Others and the Commonwealth of Australia, in which a judgment was handed down on 2 September 1987; it has been around for a while so we should know about it. The Chief Justice, Sir Anthony Mason, Justice Wilson, Justice Dawson, Justice Toohey and Justice Gaudron said this about the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The foregoing survey of the legislative provisions is destructive of any idea that Parliament has sought to impose a tax on fringe benefits provided by an employer to an employee and has then sought to impose tax on a separate subject or separate subjects of taxation outside that area.</PARA>
<PARA>When they talk about `separate subjects of taxation', they are talking about the provisions of the constitution which use that expression. They continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly enough the legislation has been framed on the footing that there is but a single subject of taxation, formulated according to a broad conception of what constitutes fringe benefits. That conception embraces benefits, not being salary and wages, referable to the employment relationship, whether provided by the employer or not and whether received by the employee or not. So understood the legislation presented for the consideration of each House of Parliament a "unity of subject matter" rather than distinct and separate subjects of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>The High Court went on to say that, if there is any doubt about it, the High Court should give credence to the way the parliament goes about the action. The High Court says that it should, unless it is quite clear on the face of it, give effect to what the parliament wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not taking up the High Court's suggestion that credence has to be given by it to what the parliament says. Rather, we are saying, `We think the High Court might say this; therefore we will go about a task in a particular way'. Page 344 of the judgment states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Court is bound to insist on compliance with the requirements of s. 55 so that the section achieves its purpose of enabling the Senate to confine its consideration in each case to a taxing statute dealing with a single subject of taxation, in applying the test stated above, the Court will naturally give weight to the Parliament's understanding that its Tax Act deals with one subject of taxation only. This is because the application of the test involves what is in substance a question of fact or value judgment. The Court should not resolve such a question against the Parliament's understanding with the consequence that the statute is constitutionally invalid, unless the answer is clear . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is as clear as burning daylight that this issue is not clear in relation to the remarks made by Senator Vanstone. The High Court is saying that it will not put such strictures on the parliament that it cannot legislate properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can take the instance that was given by Senator Vanstone about the tax that credit unions have to pay. The High Court has said&mdash;whether this is within the general use of language or not&mdash;that if one removes an exemption, in this case from a credit union, which it had up until that time enjoyed so that it now has to pay tax where it did not have to pay tax before, that is not imposing tax within the meaning of section 55. In common parlance we might say, `Yes, that is imposing tax', but the High Court has said that that is not the imposition of tax within the meaning of section 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 removes that exemption so that credit unions become liable to pay 33 per cent tax. If that was all it did, there would be no doubt, on the basis of the High Court authority, that that was not an imposition of tax. But the same bill goes on to say that, instead of having to pay 33 per cent tax, the credit unions will have to pay only 20 per cent tax. So even though it is excused from paying 33 per cent, it will have pay 20 per cent. It is said that that is the imposition of a 20 per cent tax, even though if the credit unions had to pay 33 per cent tax it would not have been, according to the High Court, an imposition of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is open for dispute. People on my committee, including members of the coalition and Senator Spindler, for whom I have great respect, have found that that is an imposition of tax. They probably took into account what the High Court said, which was, `Members of the Labor Party might not think that applying 20 per cent instead of 33 per cent is the imposition of a tax, but we do'. I can understand that.

That is the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1), which is under challenge here, does not impose taxation on the credit unions. It removes an exemption from paying 33 per cent, which is not an imposition of taxes, according to the High Court, and confines the tax rate to 20 per cent. The High Court has said that if one imposes income tax as an entity and then adds to that category capital gains tax&mdash;so that capital gains tax is subject to income tax&mdash;that is not an imposition of tax. </PARA>

It is said that that is an imposition of tax. Again, that is not in accordance with the general thrust of what the High Court has said so far. The interesting thing is that all but one of the people who gave oral evidence to the committee in respect of Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) and Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) agreed with the proposition that the increase in the range of the fringe benefits tax was not an imposition of tax. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem in the earlier bill, which has now been withdrawn, was whether or not the increase in the rates of taxes was an imposition of tax within the meaning of the constitution. That question has never been directly decided. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has withdrawn that bill and put in this new set of legislation, which accommodates that. The new set of legislation is in keeping with the way that taxation bills have been drawn up since soon after federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the problem we as a Senate face is that the proposition of our simply withdrawing the present bill, Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill No. 1, and rewriting it because that would be a simple thing to do, symbolises an attitude in this chamber which should not exist. That attitude says that we should allow the High Court to run us rather than the other way around. It is not the sort of proposition that the High Court would seem to agree with, given its decision in the second fringe benefits tax case. I have the greatest respect for the High Court and the ability of every judge on it. It is not as though we are putting ourselves against the High Court, but if we go down this path we are pursuing a dangerous course as predicted by Mr Isaac Isaacs, as he then was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure of tax legislation is very important and should not be disregarded. A government which has a duty under the constitution to bring in a budget is obliged to structure legislation in the way that it thinks best. Clearly, since elements of the budget are all interlinked, it is important that they be linked in the best way. Therefore, to simply say that there is some doubt here and that we ought to change the way that bills are drafted is not to face up to our responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the risk that section 55 might be applied is high enough, things should be restructured. In this case the risk is nowhere near that high under the new regime of the eight bills that have come in. To simply restructure or redraft bill No. 1 on the basis that that would resolve any sort of doubt is not to tackle the issue with which we are faced. The issue is how the parliament is to legislate and what rights it has to deal with legislation that comes before it on its own terms, not on the terms of what might or might not be done in the High Court. The parliament should write its legislation in a way that is for the benefit of the people of Australia generally. </PARA>

The Australian Democrats support Senator Hill's motion to the extent that it applies to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1). However, I will be moving an amendment to delete paragraphs 2(b), 2(c) and 2(d) of the motion which relates to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). I will advert to the reasons for our position on both matters shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to put on the record again, as I did in an interjection while Senator Cooney was speaking, that the witnesses before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, without exception, put cases to the best of their abilities and on the basis of their professional knowledge which was not, in any way, in my considered opinion, tainted by either their employment situation or any other political considerations. I will read into the record the relevant paragraph which was contained in the first report of the committee, which related to constitutional aspects of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. Paragraph 1.3 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee puts on record its view that though it was faced with a range of opinions from highly qualified, highly competent and experienced men and women, they all gave an honest, candid and independent appraisal of the constitutional validity or otherwise of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe the Senate should take note of those remarks. I dissociate myself strongly from the comments that Senator O'Chee saw fit to make and any other aspersions that have been cast in the past. I regret to say that such aspersions have also been cast by the Treasurer on the integrity of the advisers and witnesses appearing before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the substance of the argument. In my view, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) very much challenges the arguments, the evidence and, in fact, the conclusion that was arrived at in the first inquiry of the committee relating to the constitutional aspects of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. The bill contains two constitutionally doubtful provisions, and I believe there is no reason to depart from the conclusion reached by the committee in its first hearing that there is a `real risk which is significant' that the High Court could invalidate the bill. Clearly that risk remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two provisions relate to the taxation of credit unions and the creation of a new class of fringe benefits tax on excess domestic travel. It is quite clear that, in the case of credit unions, the provisions which provide that the tax exemption is removed and the new tax is to be levied must be read together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a lot of respect for Senator Cooney's legal acumen. But I regret that I find it rather difficult to understand how one can put the argument, virtually based on a suspension of time, that one clause removes the exemption and, therefore, because the exemption has gone, the liability jumps to 33 per cent tax and that another clause, just six clauses further down, then says that the tax to be imposed is 20 per cent. I fail to see how we can do other than read those two clauses together as being the mechanics of imposing a 20 per cent tax liability where previously there was none. I believe that this part of the bill relating to credit unions very clearly increases the rate of tax. Therefore, on one reading of statements made by the High Court in various judgments, it would be held to be imposing tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that were the only clause under doubt, it would follow that this clause plus others which relate to income tax would stand, whereas the other clauses dealing with other matters would fail. However, we need also to advert to the second clause, which extends the incidence of tax. The argument here was pushed a lot less forcefully, I must admit. I think one is forced to fall back on the commonsense interpretation that if a particular provision in an act imposes tax on a group of people previously not subject to it, then it must be read as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that there is no direct High Court decision on either of those cases. Witnesses before the committee were reduced to the need to interpret statements by the High Court which were almost obiter to obtain some sort of backing for the case they were putting to us. That introduces the element of uncertainty, which I believe the government is trying to remedy in the medium to long term by introducing a the No. 2 bill as a test bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the committee dealt with the first bill and all its components, its opinion was that it is quite clear that that risk still remains, with two consequences. One of them involves the obvious dislocation of financial markets, people's financial liabilities, the tax that is levied on purchases, and the need, if the bill were to be invalidated at a later stage, for adjustments to be made retrospectively, if possible&mdash;although it is acknowledged that in many cases it is not possible. In terms of Senator Hill's motion, I think it is reprehensible that the government put before the Senate legislation which carries with it a very real risk of being invalidated at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other consequence which Senator Hill does not advert to in his motion is that the Senate may well feel constrained in its efforts to deal with each subject of taxation on its merits and that its hand might be forced into accepting a provision simply because it is part of a package&mdash;which also contains the lifting of the threshold for the purpose of Medicare contributions&mdash;that would be welcomed by the community, and that the Senate may wish to pass and not to delay in any way whatsoever. This is clearly a political strategy. It has been admitted to be such by Senator Gareth Evans in the Senate and by the Treasurer in various media statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it raises the question of whether the government is complying with the spirit of sections 55 and 53 of the Constitution as drafted by our founding fathers. When one looks at the debates, one finds it is quite clear that they were concerned that the Senate be not constrained in any way from considering individual pieces of legislation on their merits. It is for that reason that we have the prohibition on `tacking' onto taxation measures other matters or more than one subject of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that the Australian Democrats will support that part of Senator Hill's motion, paragraphs 1(a) and (b) and the general statement 2(a) adverting to the content of bill No. 2, which addresses this question. In fact, the dissenting view that I put on record in the report asks for precisely that&mdash;that the Treasurer withdraw the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) and redraft it in three parts to excise the credit union part and have it as a separate bill, to excise the excess domestic travel allowances portion and make it a separate bill and then have the remainder as a separate bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of whether the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) should also be withdrawn and redrafted or whether it is legitimate for the government to put forward a test bill admitting as it does that its constitutional validity is in doubt and that it could be challenged. In fact, there is a challenge to challenge it so that it may be brought before the High Court and its validity determined once and for all. The suggestion made by Senator Hill that this is an inappropriate course of action, that the government should in no case place before the Senate a bill that has doubtful constitutional validity, is one the Democrats do not accept. I believe it is imperative that we have certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has had a number of inquiries, we have had a lot of work done, with a lot of expense and we have not been able to come to a definitive conclusion. I believe it is perfectly legitimate for the Senate to create a situation which will give us certainty through a High Court judgment. It would be better if we could ask for declaratory opinions, and that is a matter we might take up at a future stage; however, in this case that option is not open to us. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Gough Whitlam was responsible for a lot of quixotic statements in his time. I think on this occasion he was obviously tilting at a windmill because from my recollections of 1970 he did not quite have the capacity to deliver on the rhetoric that was then uttered. Political rhetoric being what it is, sometimes people say things that can be taken out of context some years later&mdash;as Senator Alston just has&mdash;with results that, I think, need not trouble us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What perhaps ought to concern us today is some of the nonsense that has been talked by the opposition, including the arithmetical nonsense that was talked by the opposition yesterday. I have had occasion since yesterday to check the opposition's figures. The truth of the matter is that the 1981-82 wholesale sales tax measures that were dealt with in a robust fashion by the opposition of the time did have an impact in that year of the magnitude that Senator Alston has said&mdash;1.36 per cent or 1.4 per cent in round figures. That is roughly the equivalent, at least in 1993-94 impact terms, of the current measures&mdash;1.33 per cent. I accept the arithmetic as far as it goes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what Senator Alston neglected to tell us yesterday was that when one looks at the impact in the full year, in the out year, and when one looks at what the actual impact will be by 1996-97, it is a $3 billion impact which is, in fact, 2.4 per cent of the budget. As a result, the figures are just totally wrong in the way in which they were put forward by Senator Alston yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the point is made that what we are dealing with here is a $3 billion hole in our budget that is sought to be punched by the opposition by the strategy it is adopting on this occasion. Moreover, it is not doing it in the context of a government en route to a $9 billion or $10 billion deficit, which was the situation in 1981-82 when an extra $200 or $300 million hardly made any significant difference, given the kind of strategy of neglect, decay and disarray that was advocated and implemented at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of our budget strategy, which is a responsible one, a coherent one, a carefully crafted one and, moreover, one in which every dollar matters in terms of bringing the budget together, what is involved here is a very much more serious assault, as I said yesterday, on the fundamental integrity of the budget. There is no comparison with the situation as it existed in 1981-82, quite apart from what might have been the case a dozen years before that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has to be said that the news of China's nuclear test explosion which came through last night is very serious indeed, and very disappointing in the light of the kind of policy attitude that China has so often struck in the past&mdash;namely, that it is in favour of a comprehensive test ban treaty, nuclear free zones, non-proliferation treaties and all the rest of the crucial mechanisms that have to be put in place and sustained if we are going to produce a safer world than the one we have had in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China has been subject to many representations over the past few weeks and months on this subject, including by me directly to the foreign minister, Qian Qichen, in New York last week, in very explicit and direct terms. The President of the United States and others have made equally forceful representations to China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of great regret, again I say, that China seems to have decided that it can simply ignore that kind of world pressure but, moreover, ignore the logic of maintaining a de facto legal moratorium on tests in order to create the environment in which we can achieve, much more quickly than might otherwise be possible, a nuclear free environment or at least a massively reduced nuclear stockpile.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications of what has happened are obviously direct and immediate for the negotiations that we hoped would be able to be set in train shortly on a comprehensive test ban treaty. They are direct and immediate certainly in terms of the likely reaction of the other declared nuclear powers and their own testing program. We can only hope that the United States and other countries&mdash;and we are making representations to them right now to this effect&mdash;will not be tempted by the Chinese breach of the de facto moratorium which had existed to go back to tests themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications are also serious for the nuclear non-proliferation treaty review conference which we are leading up to now in 1995, the atmospherics for which are going to be very much determined by the feeling that the non-nuclear powers have about the degree of commitment that the nuclear powers have to creating a very different environment in the future than that which has prevailed in the past. Anything which suggests that some or all of the nuclear powers are going to go on testing and building their weapon stockpiles with the same enthusiasm that they have in the past is creating absolutely the wrong environment in which to seek an extension of the non-proliferation treaty and the wider application of that treaty in 1995.</PARA>

That was the context in which we went into the election. That was the kind of mandate we had from the Australian community.

This partnership, established on a dollar for dollar funding basis, will give Australia a very efficient and cost effective system of accessing the North American market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for raising the question and drawing the matter to my attention. It is certainly a cause of concern when a government seeks to use its tax exempt status in this way. I am very glad that Senator Carr has asked this question because it gives me the opportunity to outline the policy measure that we have implemented, which will be coming into effect, which will ensure that this unfair use of the tax system will not be able to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the changes that will take effect from 1 April 1994 there was a built-in bias in the system which created an incentive for employers to pay a portion of the salary package of their employees in the form of fringe benefits. This was an incentive which applied with extra force to those who were tax exempt, such as the Victorian government. It is a great pity and a cause of concern when governments seek to exploit those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some employers have turned this practice into something of an art form. As a consequence, the government has found it necessary to act. The Treasurer announced on 16 September 1992 that from April 1994 the FBT will be levied on the FBT inclusive value of the fringe benefits tax and then those payments will be made deductible for employers for income tax purposes. This means that the percentage paid will be higher for those tax exempt bodies and that the tax effective benefit to them of funding in the way outlined by Senator Carr in his question will no longer be possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new practice will mean that the distortions to the remuneration arrangements in favour of payments in the form of fringe benefits rather than salary, which of course have always flowed mainly to the benefit of higher income earners, will no longer apply. It is particularly of concern when it results in a package being presented to a state government employee at such a level by a state government which is attacking the benefits of ordinary Australian working men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me extraordinary that one individual can be paid $300,000 without adverse effect to the Victorian economy but nobody can be paid leave loading on holiday pay, even if he or shee is a clerk earning $20,000 a year, one-fifteenth of what Mr Baxter gets. The advantage for fringe benefit in those circumstances has historically been greater for employers on low tax rates, particularly for income tax exempt employers such as our friends in the Victorian state government that Senator Carr referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an 18-month lead time between the announcement of the measure and its introduction which we hope will allow businesses time to review their remuneration arrangements and to otherwise adjust in preparation for the transition. I hope those concerned are doing that but if they are not, then the changes will take effect from 1 April next year. If we cannot get cooperative fairness in the tax act, these measures will take effect to enforce a bit of fairness.</PARA>

In view of the Prime Minister's actions in the other place over the past few weeks in suspending matters of public importance and censure motions and yesterday cutting short question time after 23 minutes and three questions, and with the minister's particular interest in and contribution to international human rights, is the minister concerned that the human rights of the Australian public are being tampered with by the Prime Minister's suspension of traditional rights under our parliamentary system for the government to be questioned for its actions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every one of the steps that have been taken by the Prime Minister and the government in the House of Representatives has had its own explicit justification based on the misbehaviour of the opposition. The reason why MPIs have been suspended and parliamentary time has been devoted wholly to legislation is the impossible set of hurdle deadlines that the opposition itself has set for the government in conducting its legislative program&mdash;firstly, the requirement that bills be introduced by 1 October and, secondly, of course, the requirement that they be debated to fruition in order for them to be able to be brought into this place by the second deadline that was set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has created a situation where there is no alternative for the House of Representatives and the government managing the business of the House of Representatives but to go hell for leather with legislation every available hour of the day.

Does the minister intend to re-regulate union sponsored certified agreements to put them on the same footing as the proposed non-union award flexibility agreements? In particular, does the minister intend to empower the Industrial Relations Commission to determine whether certified agreements pass a public interest test which would require that a majority of employees has given genuine and informed consent, that all employees have been competently represented, that groups such as women, low-skilled workers, immigrants, young people and old people have not been disadvantaged or discriminated against and that wage rises unrelated to productivity gains are kept within a reasonable inflation target?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to make clear the circumstances with regard to these important issues that Senator Bell have raised. The government is proposing that there will be two ways of achieving formal, enforceable enterprise agreements. One route will be through the existing certified agreement provisions with some changes to widen the obligation to inform and consult employees to be covered by an agreement. The other will be through new provisions allowing agreements between employers and employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing this new avenue for enterprise flexibility agreements between employers and employees, the government intends that there be a number of important safeguards to prevent workers who do not have the protection of union membership from being disadvantaged in the bargaining. We see a great role for the Industrial Relations Commission in exercising supervisory power over negotiations for agreement involving unions and those involving employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission's capacity to ensure that bargaining is occurring fairly and in good faith will be specifically provided for. We consider that all agreements should be subject to a no disadvantage test. This means that the overall terms and conditions for employees under an agreement must not, viewed in an overall context, result in a reduction of the employees' entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each agreement will have to be underpinned by an award of the commission to provide an appropriate benchmark for the no disadvantage test. For employer and employee agreements, we will also give the commission a public interest supervisory role as an additional safeguard. We do not intend this to inhibit such agreements which the commission will have to consider on their individual merits and we will make it clear that the intention is that such agreements should be refused approval only in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not propose to add this requirement to the current tests for approving certified agreements. We consider that unions are better equipped to bargain effectively than unorganised groups of employees and do not need the same level of protection. Employees will be expressly given the right to be represented by a union of which they are members in negotiations with their employer if that union has coverage of their work at the particular enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that goes substantially to the questions raised by Senator Bell. I think it is important that we put those important facts on the record. I welcome the fact that we not only have this flexibility but also have it in a manner which protects the interests of the less well organised and the workers who otherwise might have had some detriment to their conditions.

At various points those allowances will change and they do not always change downwards, by the way, sometimes they change upwards. When there was a government in Cambodia there was always an intention to have a different level of allowances than previously. Change in allowances will only affect, for a very short period, people serving in Cambodia. As Senator Archer will realise from an answer that I gave at question time in the previous week, a majority of those soldiers are redeployed to Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two reasons why the AMA seems to justify its claims. The first is that in some way CPI and wage increases have outstripped the medical benefits schedule. That is pretty hard to see as in the past decade the medical benefits schedule has gone up 62 per cent; the CPI has gone up by less than 60 per cent; and the actual index average weekly ordinary time earnings that the AMA has been using, or at least has used this year, has gone up only 54 per cent. So it is nonsense to suggest that we have not kept pace with the CPI or those kinds of indexes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason that the AMA has featured, especially yesterday in some comments which were made by its president, is this question of practice costs. It is there that we are finding some great difficulty in getting the data that backs up the assessments. In fact, we still have not been supplied with any data, so we cannot verify it. But I look with some scepticism at the AMA's claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, it is suggested by the AMA that obstetricians and gynaecologists have practice costs of 49.7 per cent. That is a pretty high amount for practice costs. If we look at the top quartile of obstetricians and gynaecologists, we are looking at almost $300,000 a year for practice costs. That is a hell of a practice! I would be delighted if anyone could ever show any justification for it&mdash;but they will not, of course. When we meet in two weeks time, the AMA still will not have backed up those figures. I will be delighted if it has. If it has, then I will certainly come back in and share that information with those opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the other point that must be made in answer to the question by Senator Chris Evans is to look at how this again just widens the gap between general practice and specialists. Over the course of the past few years and looking at attempting to restore the role of general practice through vocational registration and through grants made in the GP reform program, the government has set about a path to try to take the lot of general practice and improve it. But this new AMA schedule simply reverses this in favour of a few specialties. For instance, while GP items go up by less than one per cent, specialist surgeon items go up by an average of more than two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is appropriate to deal with those anomalies in any event in these annual exercises. It will require a proper relative value study. While I did ask at a meeting with the AMA in August for it to participate in the one that we intend to start in November, I still have not had an official reply; I expect it soon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the main point to make is that 79 per cent of all services are billed at or below the government's schedule fee. Doctors give the real verdict on the AMA fee: only five per cent of services are billed at or above the AMA fee. Doctors themselves know it is so hot that they cannot be in it; it is so hot, the great majority will not be in it. But those few greedy ones who are need to be led by the AMA. The AMA must stop justifying the unjustifiable. It must take the responsibility to make sure that doctors do not misuse market power. It has to take the responsibility to make sure that those specialists who cannot see reason are brought to heel by, by and large, a responsible profession of decent men and women.</PARA>

<PARA>Earlier today I tabled a report from ASTEC, the Australian Science and Technology Council, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research and technology in tropical Australia&mdash;summary report</EMPHASIS>. The report has examined comprehensively the development of Australia's north and the role that research and technology might play in the next decade. The report will provide a great opportunity for tropical Australia. It informs the rest of Australia about tropical Australia's cultural and physical assets, its current research infrastructure and its needs. This major report is ASTEC's response to a commission from the Prime Minister in April 1992 to examine research and technology in tropical Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that its report would reflect the views of the people of tropical Australia, ASTEC undertook 18 months of extensive consultation within the region and released a draft report for public comment in May of this year. The council also consulted widely across the whole of Australia. The report analysed R&amp;D on both a sectoral and a cross-sectoral basis to ensure that broader issues are given proper weight. Cross-sectoral issues were examined under three broad headings: firstly, R&amp;D to take advantage of tropical Australia for the benefit of the nation&mdash;an opportunity for world leadership; secondly, R&amp;D for a sustainable society in the region; and, thirdly, R&amp;D specific to the environment of tropical Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to highlight just three of the major issues raised by ASTEC's report. They are: strategic planning of research, tropical health service delivery, and research management for the tropical woodland and savanna systems. The ASTEC report identifies a major structural problem with R&amp;D for tropical Australia; that is, insufficient linking of R&amp;D to community, business or national needs, including the ecologically sustainable development of tropical Australia. This is not a new problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ord River illustrates the need for the strategic planning approach to research planning. Today the Ord River irrigation area is providing out-of-season produce such as melons and bananas to southern Australia. These crops were not envisaged when the dam was built in the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ord's success today is due to researchers working with an experienced farming business community and research programs being linked to a business systems approach. I was informed that one of the reasons for the success of these out-of-season crops is the completion of the sealing of an all-weather road from this area to the southern areas of Australia so that the produce could be efficiently and quickly transported to the markets of the south. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTEC recommends a strategic planning or business systems approach to the Commonwealth government funding and performance of R&amp;D for tropical Australia. Examples of emerging industries which could benefit from a coordinated tropical Australian strategic plan are horticulture and some areas of aquaculture. ASTEC notes that the challenges of ecologically sustainable development loom large for industries in tropical Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental problems stemming from the rapid intrusion into the tropics of temperate zone agriculture and mining technologies are becoming urgent. The report recommends that research management for the tropical savanna and woodland ecosystems requires immediate attention. It suggests an approach that involves both states and the Northern Territory working cooperatively in the management of this ecosystem which is so important to the mining, tourism and agricultural industries of tropical Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people living in tropical Australia are in remote areas with reduced community services and social support. The contribution of research and technology to the health of these Australians in tropical areas, particularly those of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage, is identified as a major concern. The report recommends an investigation of research on public health delivery for tropical Australian communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the ASTEC report recommends that a mechanism be put in place to oversee the implementation of the vision outlined in its report.

<PARA>I am at a fraction of a disadvantage because the Table Office is not able to give me a copy of Scrutiny of Bills <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest </EMPHASIS>No.6, but I suspect that it would deal with the question of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill that I understand was dealt with by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee recently. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee raised a question about the retrospectivity of an aspect of that particular bill dealing with the dairy industry; that is, I understand, that part that amends the Dairy Produce Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate the committee's concern about retrospectivity in relation to that particular piece of legislation. The legislation deals with an import offset to an export enhancement scheme for the dairy industry. It is a scheme funded by the dairy industry itself, but it has the intention of enhancing exports without having, at the same time, those export enhancements offset by any imports of the same kind that are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been brought to my attention that the Atherton Tableland Cooperative Dairy Association Ltd in North Queensland has been severely adversely affected by the retrospective element of this bill. The dairy cooperative is an organisation which has for many years exported dairy products. It has enhanced Australia's international standing by earning overseas dollars for its exports. It has exported to Japan and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago the company found itself in some difficulty in fulfilling its export commitments because climatic conditions&mdash;namely, drought&mdash;had interfered with its supply of milk. It did not have enough milk to make the export cheese that it was committed to sell. The company used its milk supply to make enough of the product to fulfil its overseas commitments, but then it did not have enough product to fulfil its local commitments. So it imported some cheese from New Zealand and used that to fulfil its local commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was all very fine. The company applied for its export enhancement. At the time of doing this, it looked at the legislation and said, `What can we do?'. It saw that the legislation said, in effect, that if it imported product and then used that product as an ingredient of exports, it had to pay the import offset. So it looked at that. It got legal advice on the legislation as it then was. It then entered into the course of action that it was adopting because the law said that that is what it could do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that, the company put itself in a position where it was disadvantaged to the extent of either $67,000 or $87,000. The company should have received an export enhancement of a certain amount, but the dairy industry people or the government people who control this deducted an amount as an offset. So the cooperative found itself in a position where it was $67,000 out of pocket. It was quite sure it was correct because it took advice at the time. It acted on the law as it was at the time and it did so legitimately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a suggestion that the company was out to rort the system, that it had been in this business before, but that is simply not correct. It was not in the business of importing; it had never really imported before; it was not an importer, as such. It simply arrived at this situation where, in order to fulfil its domestic and international markets, it had to import something. It looked at the law, found out what it said and acted accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It then so happened that someone said, `You're not acting in accordance with the scheme'. It was said that everybody in the industry knew what the rules really were and understood what it was all about and that there had been bits of paper issued over the period which clearly said what the rules were all about. The fact that those bits of paper were drawn by someone who did not understand the legislation does not seem to count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an instance of a company that has read the legislation, found out what it is all about, taken action as a result of it and then found that, according to the industry, it was doing the wrong thing. So it took legal action, set the matter down for hearing in court after a time and was about to proceed in court when it received advice from dairy industry people and the government that the government was going to retrospectively alter this legislation to defeat its claim. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that exporters will be required retrospectively to pay a charge which may not have been legally payable at the time they imported the relevant dairy produce. It appears that the doubt as to proper imposition of the charge have been so great that the Corporation appears not to have collected it. Accordingly the Committee seeks the minister's advice on the legal basis on which the scheme was administered and the charge imposed. The committee draws senators' attention to the provision, as it may be considered to trespass unduly on the personal rights and liberties in breach of principle 1(a)(i) of the Committee's terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that it did seek the advice of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) and that the minister has, at a fairly late stage, provided an advice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As vice-chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's 56th general report, which deals with the activities of the committee during 1992, and move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a very busy year for the committee. In fact, 29 public hearings were held at a variety of locations, including Christmas Island, Weipa, Darwin, Townsville, Perth and Wollongong. The committee carried out 23 inspections, which took in existing facilities and proposed construction sites as well as completed facilities. Twenty-one reports were tabled. The estimated cost of public works on which the committee reported during 1992 was $1.486 billion, which is a record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence collected on the references amounted to more than 5,000 pages of transcript, and 265 witnesses appeared before the committee at public hearings. By any measure, these outcomes are prodigious. As in past years, the committee's general report describes a number of what can be best described as difficult projects and raises a number of matters for concern which emerged during the year. The most difficult project was the inquiry into the public works aspects of the Civil Aviation Authority's proposed air traffic service centres at Brisbane and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 June last year the chairman of the committee informed the House of Representatives about the difficulties and frustration which were experienced by the committee in the exercise of its duty by the unwillingness or inability of key CAA witnesses to answer relevant questions. Concerns were raised during the committee's inquiry into the selection of the successful tenderer for the provision of the hardware, software and buildings for the Australian advanced air traffic control system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee recommended that the responsible minister set up an independent panel to carry out a thorough review of all aspects of the awarding of the contract. This, to the credit of the minister at the time&mdash;who was Senator Cook, I believe&mdash;and I might say the government as well, was done and a review was carried out by Mr Ian Macphee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key element of the committee's misgivings about the tender selection process concerned the process leading to the selection of the successful tenderer. The stand taken by the committee in recommending an independent review was vindicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review found that the original tender selection process was departed from in a manner which was both unsound and unfair. The review also recommended that the two competing companies for the contract revert back to the original process. This has been done and next week the committee will resume its inquiry into the public works components of the TAAATS project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, judging from media comments about the stand taken by the committee in relation to the matter, the committee has served the parliament and the people of Australia well. In fact the committee can take considerable pride in what Mr Macphee wrote about it in his report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament has rights in the public interest and its all party Committees are one of the few practical checks upon the abuse of executive power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Works Committee is one of the hardest working, but normally low profile, Committees. Its current members are conscientious Parliamentarians without a desire for publicity or controversy. Nor do they have any undue sense of their own importance.</PARA>
<PARA>I quite agree with those remarks. I think Mr Macphee is obviously very sound in his observations. He concludes with a pithy observation. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The behaviour of the Parliamentarians involved was in the best tradition of the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Another matter raised in this general report concerns the timing of references. The majority of references last year were received during the budget sittings. There has been an expectation by departments and agencies for the committee to undertake its inquiries and report within a short time span. Sometimes this is impossible. But in the future we do not want to see a repeat of 11 references being referred in the budget sittings, the majority of which have been referred late in the sittings, all needing to be reported on, on or before the summer recess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far this year the flow of references has been somewhat more even. I hope it continues that way. Sometimes during informal discussions with departmental officials the question of the mandatory limit was raised&mdash;the expectation being that the committee, in its wisdom, would agree to the limit being increased from $6 million to $10 million or perhaps $20 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does not consider it appropriate for the limit to be increased. The estimated cost of the majority of projects examined during 1992 was well in excess of $6 million. The cost of only two references was marginally in excess of $6 million. These were for works of national importance which the committee felt deserved examination. Those projects related to the construction of a new permanent repository for the Australian Archives at East Burwood in Victoria, costing $6.5 million and a storage display facility for the Australian War Memorial in Mitchell in the Australian Capital Territory, costing about $6.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since departments and agencies are now able to appoint their own design and construction authorities, without the involvement of the Australian Construction Services, there has been some discussion about compliance with building standards and local planning codes. Correspondence with the former minister for administrative services relating to the use of independent building certification services or agents is highlighted in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of concern is the perennial question of inspections of overseas projects. For many years the committee has vigorously objected to the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act which, on one hand, require the committee to report on overseas works&mdash;embassies and high commissions&mdash;and, on the other, prevent it from travelling or meeting overseas to inspect properties and to take evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One might say that perhaps that is inviting our committee to have junkets. But in my own experience, in my own time during the break, I went to Papua New Guinea to inspect a couple of projects that we had carried out there&mdash;one in excess of $40 million and another one which will cost some $20 million and will be referred to the committee this year. I do not believe that we as a committee can really understand the full problems that are being faced in PNG unless we visit the areas. Only by visiting there was I able to at least satisfy myself as to the large amount of money that was being spent, mainly on security matters. Unless one visits the country at first-hand, it is very hard to assess that particular aspect of the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the committee examined two proposals involving overseas works, one in Thailand and the other in Fiji. The committee was unable to carry out on-site inspections. The benefits of site inspections and discussions with local staff would have far outweighed the associated costs in doing that. In fact, I think it would be much cheaper for the committee, or at least a subcommittee, to visit the sites than it would have been to bring the bureaucrats and the associated personnel here to Canberra to explain the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the year the committee continued to focus on the provision of more energy efficient building designs as well as the utilisation of alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power. On Christmas Island, the committee discovered that, although the island is within the belt of trade winds, the provision of wind driven electricity generating systems was not included in the proposed Christmas Island redevelopment. The committee recommended that a system be provided. A pilot study is under way and the committee is confident that it will be successful and will reduce the reliance on diesel generators on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also believes the success of this project will reduce, if not eliminate, significant latent conservatism amongst engineers and technicians towards embracing what in most comparable countries are already proven technologies. The committee has also been pursuing with some vigour the provision of solar hot water heaters in houses being constructed for the Defence Housing Authority. During the year the authority agreed that half the houses in a development at Seaward Village in Perth would be provided with solar hot water heaters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of occupational health and safety in air-conditioned buildings, legionnaire's disease is a spectre against which all proper precautions must be taken. The report mentions a number of aspects of legionnaire's disease and the exemplary steps being taken by the managers of Parliament House to ensure that all possible precautions are taken. These steps have wider ramifications and establish a baseline for all building managers. I urge all honourable senators to read that particular part of this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of child-care, during the year the committee continued to focus attention on arrangements for the care of young children of staff to be employed in buildings under consideration. For example, the Australian Taxation Office, one of the largest public sector employers, advised the committee of a number of developments and initiatives in relation to the provision of child-care facilities in buildings upon which the committee has reported in recent years. Things are happening, and it is about time too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I said at the beginning that 1992 was a busy year. The report mentions a number of references and associated inspections, and preparation of the report placed considerable strain not only on the committee but also on the staff. It was largely through the dedication, professionalism and hard work of the staff which enabled the committee to cope with such a heavy workload and to achieve, at times, difficult reporting targets. The committee is fortunate to have a dedicated staff led by the secretary, Peter Roberts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before lunch I was speaking about the need to trace the history of this matter to put it in its proper context. I referred the Senate to the decision of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and to the committee's findings on that matter, which have received quite wide publicity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two key findings to that report. The first, which has to be remembered, was that this was a decision for the High Court of Australia and that in the end the only way this matter would be resolved was by decision of the High Court. The second finding was that there was a real risk, which was significant, that that bill might be found to be unconstitutional. The Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) responded to the committee's concerns and, as requested by the committee, split the bills. It had been suggested that he might split the bills into five separate bills, but we are now dealing with eight bills. Two of those bills were referred to our committee again to examine and report back to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) has become known as the test bill. This is the bill with which the government has sought to test the proposition advanced by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that there are some doubts about the constitutionality of the approach adopted in the original bill. The bill addresses the major legal concern which worried the committee in its first report; that is, whether an increase in the rate of an existing tax is the imposition of taxation within the meaning of section 55 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By passing Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) we will test that issue and resolve the uncertainty around the parliament's powers in relation to taxation legislation. The government remains absolutely confident that that bill will survive that test and is in no doubt that the other seven bills are constitutionally valid. The committee heard evidence on both the bills that were the subject of its reference. The committee, finally, by majority&mdash;the government senators and Senator Spindler of the Democrats&mdash;resolved to recommend that Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) be passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has taken a rather curious position in relation to this matter. It was those opposite who raised the doubts about the constitutional validity of the approach adopted in the bill. It was they who sought and obtained legal advice. It was they who promoted the discussion regarding the uncertainty of the parliament's powers. It was they who sought to have the matter clarified. Now, when given the chance to have the matter tested, when given the opportunity to support the test bill, which was framed for the very purpose of responding to their concerns, they do not want to be in it. They seek to criticise the government for its response, which was the very response sought by the committee in responding to the concerns expressed over the first bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is astounding that now that the government has moved to bring certainty to this area, to resolve any doubts and to provide the answers which we were all seeking, the opposition seeks to oppose it. I hope the Senate passes Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) and allows for this question to be resolved in the only place it can be resolved&mdash;the High Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) clearly is not a test bill. It was drafted by the government to provide absolute certainty as to its constitutional validity. It seeks to implement a number of the measures contained in the budget, but it does not increase the rate of any existing tax. It is designed to remove the one major concern that existed about the validity of the original bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not contain the element which was the focus of most legal concern in the original Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993; nor does it seek to test those issues. It clearly is designed to avoid that issue and provide for constitutionally sound legislation. Despite that fact, there has been an attempt to call into question the legal credentials of that bill. In my view the argument is very weak. That is why there is a majority report, from the same committee that raised concerns about the original bill, that there is no problem with the constitutionality of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two concerns are raised in relation to this bill. The first is a wider view which, put simply, firstly, requires that the High Court overturn all of its precedents in taxation legislation and, secondly, requires the High Court to reject nearly all of Australia's tax legislation that has been framed since 1910. It is a quite preposterous proposition that does not gain much support at all. Even some of the critics of the original legislation are not prepared to back that sort of proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern raised about the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) is centred on the question of the credit union tax. Other senators have gone into detail about that issue. I do not want to delay the Senate by debating it in detail, but, essentially, that legislation seeks to remove the exemption from taxation that credit unions enjoy. It has been challenged as being somehow unconstitutional. The logic of the argument is that it is constitutional for the government to strike a rate of 33 per cent taxation on credit unions but it is not constitutional for the government to strike the rate at 20 per cent. It is a complete nonsense, it has no widespread support among the legal advice presented to the committee, and I think to try to use that as a basis for opposing the legislation is a very flimsy argument indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, as I say, the arguments against this bill are very thin. They lack the substance of the arguments against the original Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. Evidence of the weakness, in my view, is that one of the lawyers giving evidence to the committee and also Senator Vanstone in her remarks today are unable to refute the argument based on legal precedent, case law and the history of taxation decisions by the High Court. They instead resort to an argument that basically states that the High Court could not possibly uphold its established line of reasoning in this case because it does not accord with commonsense or the understanding of the ordinary person in the street of normal practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, when lawyers turn to that sort of explanation to defend their position I get very worried. I have always been a bit cynical about lawyers. I always thought they made a good living out of the ordinary person in the street not being able to understand legislation and legal form. But I am astounded when lawyers, when confronted with evidence of precedents and case law, and strong arguments as to the constitutionality of this bill, resort to saying, `But it doesn't fit with the understanding that an ordinary person in the street would have and, therefore, the High Court will overturn all the precedents and all the case law and suddenly decide that it had been wrong in the past and find this bill to be unconstitutional'. I think that is highly far-fetched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question the Senate really has to ask is: what is the risk? There is always some risk that any legislation we pass might be successfully challenged on some ground before the High Court. But it is a question of saying whether that risk is significant and whether it is sufficient to really worry the Senate in exercising its proper role in reviewing the legislation. I think I gather support for that proposition by the remarks made by Senators Vanstone, O'Chee and Ellison in their additional remarks to the committee's original report. They made the following very sensible observation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously the government makes the political decision as to the format of its legislation. But the Parliament and the Australian people are entitled to be informed as to the risk the government takes in proceeding one way as opposed to another.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a reasonably fair statement of the position. Those senators on that occasion acknowledged the government's role and its entitlement to frame its own legislation. They also said that it was proper that the Senate make an assessment of the risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that the government senators on this committee have brought an impartial attitude to this whole debate. What we did in reorganising the first taxation deficit reduction bill was assess that risk, say that it was significant and depart from the government's reasoning, saying that on the basis of our concerns, the government ought to review its approach. The government, I might say, though not terribly happy with our view, nevertheless responded to that criticism and our concerns and did split the bills. That is what we are dealing with now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the government senators have established their credentials in terms of looking at these questions objectively. In our view, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) is constitutionally sound and the level of risk involved in the bill being passed by the Senate and then challenged is minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No witness before the committee expressed the view that the level of risk was of the order that they had rated the risk involved in the original bill. Even the most ardent critics of the original bill were prepared to say that the level of risk that would result in our passing this bill was not of the same order. In fact, a number of the people who originally expressed some concerns about the original bill were not prepared to express those same concerns about the legislation now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, there can be no case made for anything other than that there exists a very minimal risk that the legislation could be successfully challenged. Those risks are based on arguments that would require most of our taxation legislation to be invalidated by the High Court or, if one takes the narrower view, at least require the reading down or invalidation of other pieces of legislation passed by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who want to raise the question of risks in this issue, one has to ask where those people were when we passed previous tax bills? Where were they when we passed other legislation that everyone admits included the same sort of devices and approach to the drafting of legislation? If they intend to oppose this, they have to oppose a range of other legislation that this parliament has passed with their acquiescence in the past. They are not doing that. It is convenient on this occasion to raise the legal issues because it provides some protection from dealing with the politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take my place here today fully conscious of the responsibilities which now rest with me as a member of the Senate and honoured that I have the opportunity to serve Australia in this place as we work to accommodate the demands and changes to our society which will face us as we approach the 21st century. I am enthusiastic about the challenges which my new responsibilities will bring, and I look forward to representing the Australian Labor Party and the people of Tasmania over the next six years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I owe a debt of gratitude to the many people who have supported me for this position: colleagues in the Labor Party; my family and friends; members of the community groups with whom I have worked; and the members of the trade union movement in Tasmania who have given me support, encouragement, advice and assistance. I thank them and trust I will justify their faith in me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a national perspective, I welcome the opportunity to continue to work on the implementation of the government's social justice agenda. I am proud of Labor's record of achievements in these areas and look forward to promoting those still to come in the years ahead. I am committed to continuing to work towards a more equitable society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words of Simone de Beauvoir that `humanity is something more than a mere species&mdash;it is an historical development' remind me very forcibly that I am part of a greater whole and that my contribution to date, and that which I will make in the future, owes as much to those who have gone before me and to those who will walk by my side over the next six years as it will to the particular skills and experience which I bring to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to acknowledge the work of colleagues, friends and Labor predecessors who have carried the flame of social justice and provided examples worth following. I am heartened that more women are taking their place in the political processes at all levels. There are some whom I would specifically wish to mention for their work and contribution to a better society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the work of Tasmanian state Labor parliamentarians Fran Bladel, Judy Jackson and Gill James who have worked tirelessly on issues such as community access and consultation, the prevention of domestic violence and the development of anti-discrimination measures; also former senator Susan Ryan and Senators Margaret Reynolds and Rosemary Crowley who have advanced these causes at a national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own community, women such as Mary Binks, convenor of the Tasmanian Women's Consultative Council, work within the Tasmanian community to provide the focus and direction leading to policy development and implementation processes at a political level. I pay tribute to Jean Hearn, the only other female Labor senator who has represented my state. There are many such men and women to whom I would wish to pay tribute, and I trust that they will know that their contribution is recognised and valued, not just by me, but by the many people whose lives they have affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other whom I must mention today. I wish to begin my service to this chamber by paying tribute to the work and career of Michael Tate. The timing of Michael's resignation meant that his parliamentary colleagues did not have the opportunity to recognise his contribution in the usual manner. I am privileged to undertake this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Tate has given politics and Australia much more than 15 years of service as a senator, including his six years service as a minister. He has been a model for many by setting and maintaining high personal standards of integrity, loyalty and commitment. He has inspired us with his vision for a better, fairer society and he has worked tirelessly to earn the respect, trust and support of people for the ideals and values of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael has been a key player in achieving many of the party's social justice goals. Throughout his career, the principles of social justice have underpinned his work and values. In his first speech to the Senate on 23 August 1978, Michael referred to key areas which were of concern to him, vowing to tackle these issues during his parliamentary career. Among these issues was the need to revitalise a sense of national identity and to develop a set of national goals. He spoke out against the arms trade and the use of armed force as a serious and retrograde step. The diversion of resources on such a massive scale from the relief of human suffering, he pointed out, was fundamentally unjust. And he identified the social significance of trading and commercial life to equity, and the improvement of our quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at Michael's aims and concerns in 1978 and compare them with his achievements in 1993, we can see further evidence of the remarkable commitment and constancy which characterised his career. He has achieved his goals to the considerable benefit of the Australian society. We now have stronger, fairer and more uniform laws nationally and across states, dealing with issues such as gun control, domestic violence, consumer protection, constitutional reform, police jurisdiction and police procedures. Justice and equity issues, values which the Australian Labor Party has always stood for, have been the cornerstone of Michael Tate's career and his achievements have honoured himself and the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His examples have provided strong inspiration for my own political and community involvement. I am proud to acknowledge the role that he has played in assisting me to develop my political skills. He has been a colleague, a mentor and a friend. Along with many of my fellow Tasmanians, I will miss him while he serves overseas. I regret that his political career has ended prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I joined the Australian Labor Party in 1982 because it was then, and still is, the most legitimate way to try to influence the decision making processes to improve the lives of people in our society. It is still the only political group with a proven track record in the areas of social justice. The contribution of people like Michael Tate shows us that no one person can solve the problems of inequalities which confront us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I take my place here today, I am conscious of the importance of clearly establishing my position within the context of the Labor philosophy and indicating those areas in which I believe I can make my contribution. Essentially, I stand for the promotion of social justice, cooperation and tolerance. I am a team player and believe that by working together we can achieve great things. The theme developed for the International Year of Youth in 1985, `Together we can be amazing', catches my sentiment. I believe in the dignity of humanity and in the right of each individual to be able to express his or her own particular sentiment. My aim over the next six years is to promote social justice issues related to access and equity which will enhance the dignity and the rights of all in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With particular focus on the areas of health, education and justice, through an increasing involvement in processes of decision making and community consultation, equity and access to information services provided by government agencies are priority issues which I wish to promote and develop. My own experiences as a woman, teacher, parent, and as the manager of a community legal centre and of many community groups has increased my commitment to equity issues and heightened my awareness that, no matter how great the gains have been over the past 10 years, we still have much to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two issues arising from these areas which I believe will increase in importance over the next years: firstly, access to justice through our legal system; and, secondly, the construction of a process which will allow full community debate on medical ethics. Consistent, clear prioritising in the decision making processes which drive the allocation of the health dollars at state and federal levels need to be established. These issues are linked by questions related to public funding, equity and justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access to justice through our legal system is a critical issue which must be addressed as a matter of urgency. Labor governments have done much to make the law more accessible to Australians over the last 10 years. We now have effective networks of community legal centres and the provision of legal aid to people in need. This has done much to demystify the law and enable everyone who faces the courts to be represented professionally and equitably. However, areas remain where improvements need to be made. These areas relate to equity and access in justice through the legal system outside the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now reached the stage where the complexity of our society means that we are faced with an increasing number of situations where speedy access to legal advice prior to reaching the courts is not only desirable but also necessary if we are serious about the provision of justice for all. It should not be only the privileged who are able to access the types of advice which can often circumvent the trauma of legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the second of these issues, the promotion of informed community debate on questions related to medical ethics and the allocation of public funding for health care are long overdue. Where debate has occurred, it has tended to be reactive to the moral and ethical repercussions of medical technology not properly being considered before the technology has been introduced into our health care system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All too often, costs tend to be the catalysts which drive the ethics. While these issues are separate, they are obviously linked. Modern technology has meant that more and more costly and complex procedures are being developed, and the traditional boundaries and moralities are being challenged. While these developments have undoubtedly improved the lives of many, they have also presented ethical and funding problems for health administrators. Questions related to quality of life, equity and opportunity to gain access to the new technology and moral and legal issues related to procedures such as the IVF programs have all presented enormous challenges to our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Communities have expected that they will have access to high quality medical care, and generally in Australia we have been fortunate in providing this to the vast majority of the population. However, as medical science becomes more complex and more costly, we need to recognise that we simply do not have the capacity to provide unlimited resources without question or community accountability. We must be clear about our community priorities and more specific about what we expect our health care dollar to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also acknowledge the responsibility we face as a society for the moral and ethical repercussions of the technologies which we sanction through the allocation of public funding. The establishment of these priorities, responsibilities and shared goals can be resolved only through greater community participation in the decision making processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New South Wales began the process of raising the medical ethics issue several years ago when the New South Wales Department of Health commissioned a report by Dr Niki Ellis to undertake a study of the relative costs of modern health care procedures. Taking $75,000 as the baseline, Dr Ellis's report compared the relative costs of neonatal intensive care to open heart surgery, hip replacement surgery and quit smoking courses. Her work has provided the basis for the examination of ethical and funding issues in public health in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although ethicists and medical administrators are concerned about the issue of how we as a community make decisions about the appropriate way to spend our health care dollar, the issue urgently needs to be addressed by the broader community. It is now time to construct a framework for community consultation and debate on this most important issue. It is an issue which should include and involve all members of the community. The health care professionals, administrators, community groups and all members of society have a role to play in identifying priorities and clarifying community expectations of our health care system. Greater democracy in decision making on health issues may do much to resolve the dilemma which experts face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we as politicians have an important role to play in reaffirming the right of the Australian people to be active in shaping the type of health care system we have in the future. I intend to play a role in facilitating and promoting this most important debate over the next six years. I hope to assist in the development of decision making processes on health issues which are inclusive of all facets of health care service delivery and which acknowledge the importance of developing a holistic approach to the establishment of community health care priorities. This will mean reaffirming our commitment to the less glamorous, but nonetheless critically important, aspects of health care service delivery, such as formally acknowledging the role of home based carers. This recognition is a justice and moral issue every bit as much as it is a health issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next week is National Carers Week. It is timely, therefore, to consider the enormous changes which have taken place in our society this century and to assess the impact which these changes will have on a growing group of individuals whose work and contribution to our society is often overlooked, not just by governments but by a whole range of service providers, community groups and even family members. Home based carers provide care, love and companionship in a selfless and often unrecognised manner. More importantly perhaps, they enable many people to live full lives in dignity and peace, often at a great personal cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the responsibility for the care of children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled falls to women in our society. For too long governments and society have traded on the nurturing role of women as a justification to absolve themselves of much of their responsibility to provide appropriate care for carers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues such as access to information, support services, respite care and properly indexed equitable pension scales must be better coordinated and integrated into existing community health care programs more fully. I intend to build on the work already begun nationally by previous Labor governments to redress the imbalance which has existed for far too long. I refer particularly to the work of Brian Howe and Peter Staples, and presently by Senator Graham Richardson, to increase funding for HACC services, respite services and community living programs and to develop a clear policy statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, the work done by Fran Bladel and the women on the Tasmanian Women's Consultative Council to investigate the needs of home based carers and to provide recognition for the importance of their role in our community has established a framework for government action at a state level. I believe that I can play an important role in encouraging other states to follow Tasmania's lead and identify the particular concerns and needs of home based carers so that we can work towards the development of a coherent and consistent national strategy to support their work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Russian poet Yevtushenko once said that justice is like a train that is nearly always late. He was right. Like him, I believe that justice, if it is running late or lagging behind some current development, will eventually arrive but that often we have to struggle, to wait, to wonder and to hope that it will not arrive too late to prevent damage or disorder in some other part of our lives. In my own state we are still waiting for this train to deliver the anti-discrimination legislation. Nationally, there is still work to be done to make sure that everyone has fair access to justice and to the benefits which modern technology can provide. I aim to do something to improve the train's timetable of justice over the next six years&mdash;to make sure that the train arrives on time as often as possible&mdash;so that those people most in need of assistance are given all the opportunities they require to access the means by which justice is delivered in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I wish to thank my family and friends who have travelled from Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales and my fellow colleagues. I also thank my staff, Meryl, Gloria and Bryan, for their help and support. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) is to repeal the Tax Legislation Amendment Act 1992, which was the government's so-called l-a-w, law, bill, which comprised the income tax cuts announced at the time of the One Nation statement. The bill supersedes that act by bringing forward by 7 1/2 months the first stage of the government's One Nation tax cuts whilst, at the same time, deferring into never-never land&mdash;in effect, totally abandoning&mdash;the much larger second stage tax cuts that had been proposed at that time. The bill also introduces a small tax rebate for low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the extraordinary features of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) is that it contains a provision which formally links the commencement of the first stage&mdash;now the only stage&mdash;of the tax cuts to the passage of all the government's bills to increase sales tax across the board, to impose a huge 55 per cent increase in the tax on wine, to increase taxes on credit unions, to change the tax required for friendly societies and to extend fringe benefits tax in such a way as to put at risk up to 20,000 jobs in the tourism industry. There are other bills which are not linked in this way, but which also impose other savage increases, particularly increases in the tax and excise on fuel and tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to this bill, the government is proposing to make its greatly reduced tax cuts apply 7 1/2 months earlier than legislated last year and to introduce a measly tax rebate of $2.88 a week for low income earners as partial and totally inadequate compensation for the savage indirect tax hikes across the board to which it is subjecting them. Low income earners will not even receive this miserable, minuscule rebate until close to Christmas next year, whereas all the tax increases apply before Christmas this year&mdash;and many of them applied from budget night, 17 August 1993. In the budget this year, the government initially proposed an even more insulting rebate of only $1.92 per week. This budget hits the poor and the low income earners, and it hits them very hard. So much for this government's notions of social justice, compassion and concern for the needy in our community!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the coalition, I have moved amendments to the bill which break this link between the government's income tax proposals contained in the bill before us and the sales tax bills which are increasing the main raft of indirect taxes. The coalition is simply not prepared to see the poor in our community, the low income earners, particularly single income families with young children, suffer at the hands of an incompetent and uncaring government in the way that is envisaged through the linkage provisions in this bill. There is no earthly, logical or technical connection between the income tax proposals in this bill and the savage indirect tax increases in the bills which are the subject of the linkage clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now claims that the linkage is relevant and necessary because the indirect tax increases are necessary to fund its income tax proposals. That is not what the government said before and during the March election campaign this year and in the many months preceding it in 1992. Indeed, it said consistently quite the opposite in September last year, at the time of the introduction of the bills to give a two-stage personal income tax cut&mdash;and I remind the committee that the two stages were to occur on 1 July 1994 and 1 January 1996, but without anything at all by way of income tax relief for anyone earning less than $20,700 a year at that time. When the One Nation tax cuts bill was introduced on 15 September last year, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can pay for our personal tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA>The very following day, on 16 September, in the House of Representatives, the Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I emphasise that this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the income tax cuts&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be achieved without resort to any new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>In his now infamous interview with Kerry O'Brien on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program on 19 November last year, just three months or so before the election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) reiterated that assertion even more strongly. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I'm promising is not to put up tax.</PARA>
<PARA>In his 1993 election policy speech in February this year, the Prime Minister told the nation and those unsuspecting voters who did not know him like we do that, with Labor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there will be no big, new taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>Virtually the day after the election, the government started to welsh on these quite unequivocal commitments. It knew that it had promised the world and it always knew that it would never be able to deliver it. That is what the linkage clauses in this bill are all about. They are a direct consequence of the government's broken promises on tax. It said that taxes would not go up. Of course they were going to go up under this big spending, incompetent, discredited government and&mdash;I would have to say, in the events of recent days and weeks&mdash;this totally discredited Prime Minister and Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the government should deliver the tax cuts that it promised the people before and during the election, including the income tax cuts, with no strings attached and no tying of the cuts to increases in other taxes for which the government has no mandate whatsoever. We will support the income tax reduction proposals in this bill provided there are no strings attached. Why should the income tax cuts of the hard-pressed, indeed, oppressed, taxpayers of Australia&mdash;especially the low and medium income earners&mdash;some of which are not due until some 12 months hence, be dependent on savage tax increases on most of the day-to-day items that people purchase?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The linkage clauses are unfair and harsh. They deliberately and comprehensively smash the government's solemn pre-election promises. They represent a blatant attempt to blackmail the Senate into voting for an increase in sales tax across the board, a savage increase&mdash;a more than 50 per cent hike&mdash;in the tax on wine, an increase in taxes on credit unions and an increase in fringe benefits tax at a potential cost, as I said earlier, of 20,000 jobs to the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition will support the government's personal tax cuts and rebate proposals contained in this bill&mdash;provided, as I say, that the linkage clauses are removed&mdash;I point out again to the chamber that the bill represents a major retreat from the income tax cuts that the Prime Minister so arrogantly thrust down our throats recently as being l-a-w, law, that is, already legislated. This bill today repeals that legislation enacted last year&mdash;that l-a-w, law. This bill sends into never-never land two-thirds of the tax cuts promised by the government in its One Nation statement of February 1992 and put into l-a-w, law, during the budget session in 1992 as a partial and totally inadequate offset to abandoning the tax cut due on 1 January 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that that tax cut comprised about two-thirds of the $8.5 billion promised cut. As a sop to this abandonment of more than $5 billion worth of tax cuts, the government is bringing forward by 7 1/2 months to 15 November 1993&mdash;provided we are good and let all its other bills go through&mdash;the first tranche of its 1992 legislation, which was due to apply from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I intimated earlier, it has bowed to pressure, but only as a result of justifiable outrage from the coalition and a wide range of concerned agencies and individuals. Income earners below $20,700 were getting no relief from the l-a-w cuts of 1992. The government has now very grudgingly given them a token rebate of $2.88 per week. As I said, it started off by offering the measly and insulting sum of $1.92 per week. But again, that is only to be received after the end of this financial year because it is in the form of a rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have formally moved the three amendments circulated in my name on behalf of the coalition. The amendments are interrelated and simply remove the offensive linkage clauses in the bill. I hope that they will receive the Senate's support. If they do, they will ensure that taxpayers receive a tax cut on 15 November 1993, regardless of what happens to the government's other plans to increase a wide range of unfair and regressive taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the coalition's amendments which remove the linkage, but not quite for the same reasons or all the reasons that were put by Senator Short. The Australian Democrats have always been of the view that in the current state of our economy the tax cuts are unaffordable and that the funds are needed for capital investment in order to generate jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this budget was brought in, we offered to support any move by the government to cut out, in particular, high income earners from the benefits of those tax cuts. We believe that this is a determined effort by the government to gain votes from middle or middle-high income Australia and feel  that this attempt should not be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we accept that the government is in charge of the structural features of this budget and that it would be irresponsible for us to attack the budget's basic financial structure. Therefore, we challenge the government and repeat our offer. We would prefer to see these tax cuts reduced in the upper income brackets. Should the government, even at this late stage, be prepared to take that step we would support it, though I think it might be a vain hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is an entirely different question for the government to link these tax cuts to the range of other taxation bills that have been brought in, many of which contain measures that are not satisfactory and do not bring into jeopardy the government's basic strategy but which require individual scrutiny, debate and either possible rejection or amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That being the case, the Senate is pursuing the task that it has. It is a house of review, and it has been given that task under the constitution. Section 55 of the constitution seeks to protect the right of the Senate to deal with every taxation measure separately and on its merits. What the government is trying to do in this bill continues a range of efforts that it has been trying to make, starting with the first Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 that was introduced. A committee, including its government members, unanimously found that there was a very real risk that the government's strategy to try to blackmail the Senate would result in that bill ultimately being found to be invalid by the High Court if a challenge were mounted. It was certain that such a challenge would be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government then felt obliged to take note of the committee's recommendations; it withdrew the bill and brought it back in eight parts. But bill No. 1 once again contained features which, as one would have thought had been clearly demonstrated in the hearings on the first bill, should not be present in a taxation bill. The committee had to consider it again. It is noteworthy that on that occasion the government members of the committee only came to the view that the bill, as it stood, was likely to be valid. But the coalition members and I, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, found that the same risk still existed. We felt the government should once again withdraw that bill and bring it back in three parts, in order to deal with credit unions, the fringe benefits tax on excess domestic travel allowances and the remainder of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This version that we are now debating in trying to link bill No. 3, which contains the tax rebate and the income tax reductions, with all the other provisions is the third bit of evidence before the Senate that the government is trying to intimidate the Senate into doing its bidding. It is a totally unacceptable attack on the role of the Senate. The Democrats will not give any credence to the government's attempts to do so and will support the coalition's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my strong opposition to the linkage. I voted the way that I did last night because I believe that the attempt by the government to make a linkage between this tax measure embracing the income tax cuts and the bills that have been referred to, which impose further taxation on the Australian community, was most reprehensible, inappropriate and unprecedented. It would have set a very bad precedent which other governments could follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it should have been rejected out of hand and the government forced to come back with a piece of legislation which did not include the linkage clause. I also indicate that I believe that the provisions in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.3 ) relating to taxation are inequitable. They fail to address a very key principle&mdash;that is, horizontal tax equity. That is something that has not been considered in the debate either publicly or within this chamber. It is something that needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably too late to address this issue on this occasion, but it seems to me to be totally inequitable for government taxation measures to ignore the fact that a particular income is shared amongst a number of dependants. This measure continues to ignore that fact. It is inequitable that the taxation system imposes taxation on an income irrespective of the number of persons dependent upon that income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned this because the government said that this will be a boon to middle Australia. There are certain people in middle Australia who will not consider it to be a very big boon at all because they are the ones who are shouldering the burdens&mdash;the people whom the government and the taxation department refuses to acknowledge are playing their part in supporting, nurturing and developing the future taxpayers of this country. Whilst that situation continues to exist, we are going to have a wide number of people disappointed and disillusioned by that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely it is an injustice if the number of persons dependent upon an income is not recognised for the purpose of taxation. It is recognised for a whole range of other purposes, but not for this purpose. I have digressed somewhat from the principle of linkage which we are discussing. I hope that this was a smart alec doing a try on and not really government policy. I expect better from governments at this particular point. I hope that when this linkage issue is unlinked by the Senate, the government will recognise that and accept it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As many honourable senators who are in the chamber would know, it is not usually my style, when debating tax matters, to make lengthy contributions when the arithmetic is pretty plain. This is an issue that is of sufficient importance, and I probably need to outline the governments position in relation to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) in general and the linkage matter in particular. Even though I can count, it probably also means that we will have to have a division on this matter. It is a matter of significance to the government and it would be inappropriate to allow it to go unchallenged. For the record, I give that as a prior indication.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think many people would know that it is not my usual style and I am not about to adopt it as a norm, but this is an exceptional circumstance. I mainly want to talk about linkage. Other senators said a number of other things in the course of this debate to which I will respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that seems to be substantially understated, although not unacknowledged by some, is the extent and significance of the bring forward of the tax cuts that this bill includes. It is very important for a large number of Australians and Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will come to Senator Harradine's more general point about horizontal tax equity in a moment because it is an important point. Even those families benefit. It may be that if the government were to go in the direction that Senator Harradine wished those families would benefit even more. There is no doubt that there is benefit to middle income families and people all around Australia who are dependent upon wages and salaries. They will overwhelmingly benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing to remember is that a very significant impact of this bill, if it is passed and if the arrangements are such that it can come into force, is that there will be a substantial bring forward that will benefit many Australian families in the lead up to Christmas. It will be part of the economic stimulus in the budget that will help economic growth and the creation of jobs. Those two things are important and are underestimated, so they need to be reiterated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been some derisory remarks made about the $150 rebate for low income earners. Those who think that this is a matter of no or small consequence have obviously never lived on a low income. It seems to me to be quite clear that for an overwhelming number of low income families this will be a very important element in their family finances when it comes into effect&mdash;as I am confident it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that we are talking about people with a very low tax bill. Many of the low income earners affected will have their total tax bill wiped out by the $150 rebate. To say that somehow or other the government would be wonderfully magnanimous if it increased the rebate even further, fails to take into account that the $150 eliminates the whole income tax burden of many of the people to whom we are referring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be a substantial benefit to many Australian families. The rebate and the bring forward are important. We have had a debate at the second reading stage about this matter and I do not want to divert us, but I want to make a point about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing I want to say briefly about the budget and low income families is that the response of people who seek to focus on the distributive equity&mdash;I am not going to Senator Harradine's horizontal tax equity point, which is quite separate and about which I will make a comment in a minute&mdash;ignores entirely the outlays side of the budget. Free dental services will be provided to card holders by 1 July next year. There will be a substantial benefit to those in greatest need funded out of the revenue measures in the budget. So those opposite just cannot take a one sided assessment of equity. The greatest equity role of government lies in what it does on the outlays side of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of things have been said about the relationship between these measures and the government's original announcement. I have not got the announcement in front of me at the moment. My recollection is that on 16 September last year Treasurer Dawkins, in speaking about these tax measures, made two important points that tend not to be commented on because they do not suit some of the participants in this debate. Apart from the commitment that we would not introduce a GST, the Treasurer announced that the government would not increase the overall burden of tax and it would take measures to broaden the tax base. Those were the commitments that were made on 16 September. They tend to be overlooked because people do not like them. That is part of the overall review of the tax system that is under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I turn briefly to the linkage clauses, I want to briefly comment on Senator Harradine's horizontal tax equity point. He has made it on a number of occasions. Of course, he is quite right that we cannot amend this bill to accommodate that point because it is much too complex. That does not dismiss from consideration that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for me to stand up here and announce some new government policy and I do not intend to do so. As Senator Harradine knows, it is a question of significant interest to a number of people in the government and it is a proposal that is considered worthy of serious consideration. I am not in a position to go further until the government makes a decision, and I will not be running around here unilaterally announcing new government policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an easy issue; a lot of complexities are involved. I am not saying that to put Senator Harradine down because I know that he is aware of those complexities. We cannot, therefore, just wander into such a change, but it does warrant and is receiving consideration. It is not a matter, as I know he is aware, that we can address and resolve in this bill, although it is a perfectly appropriate issue for him to raise in the discussion around the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the linkage clauses, which are the key element of the amendments before us. The Senate has to realise&mdash;and, I am sure, overwhelmingly does realise&mdash;that, with the arithmetic of this house, it may well be that it can delete from this bill the linkage to the passage of other bills and say that, as a consequence, this measure should apply from whatever date it specifies. Putting aside questions of royal assent, the parliament constitutes two houses&mdash;the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives does not share the Senate's view so it is highly unlikely that an agreed bill will pass without a linkage clause. That is the first thing to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing to say is that, even if the Senate takes this clause out, nothing in the rhetoric, nothing in the vote, can change the reality of the fundamental macro-economic linkage that exists. By carrying a resolution here, we cannot change reality. The reality is that what some in the Senate&mdash;not everybody&mdash;are seeking to do is have all the revenue reduction measures without the compensating revenue increase measures. We cannot do that; we cannot change reality by a resolution of the Senate. It does not matter what the Senate resolves, the macro-economic linkage will exist and a responsible government will need to take those linkages into account, and we will. I simply make that very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the sensitivities that people have raised about their pride as senators. The Senate has a lot of power but it cannot change reality by resolution. It is not a question of blackmailing the Senate&mdash;I understand the rhetorical flourish, it is the sort of word we all use from time to time when we want to add a bit of emphasis to an argument we are putting&mdash;it is simply making the reality evident. It is making it clear what the government considers is the necessary macro-economic responsibility that it as the government has to exercise. The Senate does not have to exercise that responsibility because it is not its role, but at some stage the Senate does have to recognise that it is the responsibility of the government to manage the economy. We do have to be in a position where we can deliver unpalatable measures as well as palatable ones; unpopular things as well as popular ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quotes by Fraser, Menzies and others have been thrown around in broad terms about whether we should or should not do particular things now. We got into some wonderful historic speculation about who might have said what and to whom over the last quarter of a century. What those people have said is that it is necessary to recognise the benefit that the Westminster system has brought to Australia against the presidential system in the United States. It is the capacity of the executive government to deliver on packages of measures that include tough and unpopular measures that presidents and the executive government of the United States have not been able to deliver on so successfully. Perhaps there is a sign that President Clinton is being a little more successful, but over the last 10 or 20 years the United States government has not been able to deliver, at profound macro-economic cost to the United States. That is not a course to which we will lightly accede, whatever view the Senate might wish to express about this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that I acknowledge from the speeches made by the four honourable senators that the overwhelming majority of Senate opinion is contrary to the government's view. But we stick by what we think is right and responsible, even though we accept that in the short term it may not be popular. Therefore, we will vote against the amendments and we will pursue our position as far as it is possible. </PARA>

<PARA>Basically, these amendments are suggestions for a top-up tax. They make a very slight change to the schedules in clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3). They propose to change the top schedule to cover incomes between $50,000 and $100,000. The tax rate remains the same at 47 per cent. They also propose that incomes exceeding $100,000 attract a 52 per cent tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has neglected to tell the Australian public of the hole of up to $3 billion in its deficit reduction strategy. As we announced last month, the budget estimates make no provision for any legal costs or compensation involved in new programs arising from the legislative response to the High Court's decision on native title. These are likely to be well over $1 billion over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget outlays have no costings for labour market assistance beyond the run-out of the existing programs. The shortfall between the forecast figure and the likely real cost is $2 billion. We are very concerned that the government continues to deplete the direct taxation revenue base and attempts to substitute indirect taxes which are insufficient to meet the known expenditure requirements over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a top-up tax, or new top marginal tax rate, would provide valuable revenue and make the tax system more progressive. The government estimates that such a tax would raise $850 million over the next four years. It would affect less than one per cent of taxpayers. Because it would be implemented in conjunction with existing reductions in marginal tax rates, it would involve someone on $120,000 per annum paying a mere $86 more each year. This is equivalent to an extra $1.64 per week&mdash;not an unbearable burden for someone on more than $2,300 a week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support these amendments. We believe that they take the income tax argument back where it should be; that is, taking into account the capacity to pay. I believe the government has neglected that aspect. This argument has been on the table for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the Senate back to 17 October 1990 when I moved an amendment to increase the marginal tax rate for incomes above $100,000 to 60 per cent. That increase would have yielded $600 million in that year. No doubt the figures would need to be adjusted now. I believe that the government has lost sight of the principle. We are being fed the argument that the incentive to work of people at a certain income level will be diminished simply because they have to pay a higher tax rate. I believe that that is a lot of nonsense. I believe that people at that level work because they enjoy the work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza considers this laughable. He made the same sorts of responses when I moved a similar amendment in 1990. I do not expect that either the coalition or the government will be supporting these amendments, because they both look after people in the high income brackets and believe that benefits to those who are at the bottom of the pile will trickle down. I would have thought that the figures, which very clearly show that there is a growing disparity between rich and poor in Australia, would prove that that theory simply does not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is time that we took a hard look at what we are doing in our taxation policy. We are now at about the third lowest level of the OECD countries in terms of raising tax revenue for public expenditure on health, job generation, education and other areas where clearly the need is high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, we need to raise our expenditure and develop a cohesive nation instead of going further down the road to becoming two nations&mdash;those that are in jobs and are the haves and can command a high income, and those that increasingly are without work because we are not spending on public investment expenditure which could generate jobs and because we open our borders to cheap imports which put more and more people out of work and which cause factories to close. I believe it is time we got back to this argument. I congratulate Senator Margetts for bringing forward these amendments and the Democrats will certainly support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to take much time of the Senate. Both Senator Margetts and Senator Spindler have been brief; I will return the compliment. These amendments take a significant step further the proposition that in some way or other it is the Senate that should decide what the tax regime of the country is. Instead of merely seeking to oppose some government proposals, we now have a proposal for the Senate to actually write in new tax scales. That is another step further.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Watson has just interjected, if one takes the opposition's interpretation of the constitution that was put forward in the debate this morning, one certainly would have to consider that it is beyond the power of the Senate to do this. It is an arguable point, but certainly many people would have the view that the Senate cannot do this by amendment. Certainly the view consistent with that position that was put earlier by some senators would mean that this could at least only be done by request.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there is a more important principle about just picking and choosing and saying, `We will pick this rate out and put it up' without it being part of an overall tax strategy. I accept the right of the Greens and the Democrats to make debating points about their disagreement with the overall government tax strategy and to use this as a vehicle to do that and to say, `We don't agree with the approach to income tax that the government is putting forward', but as a way of going about setting tax policy and tax rates it is not sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments have some other shortcomings. One is the great difficulty we get when proposals like this are considered in isolation. Let me put a hypothetical situation to the Senate. I use this example only because I saw some months ago some newspaper speculation about it so it should not start any new scares, because I am only being hypothetical. Assume the government, to fund its employment measures, did want to put some sort of levy on income tax. This would be a distinct barrier to our doing so because we would have already put this levy on but not for that purpose. So it would suddenly build a hurdle to doing something which I think, with sober consideration, the Greens and the Democrats would support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think there are some policy shortcomings in the proposal. There are some drafting shortcomings. I do not think these amendments would achieve the purposes that are set down for them in drafting terms. I am not going to make too much of that because I do not see that there is any prospect that the amendments will be carried so there is no point getting into nitpicking detail about drafting, but I do think there are some problems with that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that there are some constitutional problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two problems with proceeding casually down this route are that, firstly, you open the door to people who have that capacity incorporating&mdash;transferring their income from the PAYE tax system to the company tax system. I do not want to make too much of that. A lot of people make that a very major point. I think these days anti-tax avoidance measures are sufficiently strong to limit that, but it cannot eliminate it altogether and it is an issue. Some people would say it is a very major issue in this problem and they raised it when we proposed to reduce the company tax rate. I do not regard it as being as serious as some others do, but it exists and cannot be brushed aside entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and related question is that measures such as this actually do not catch the richest people in Australia, they catch upper income PAYE taxpayers. Those who are in the PAYE system as employees, particularly public servants&mdash;the upper income people&mdash;do not pay their tax in that way and one tends to find that we are being very discriminatory in terms of who gets hit. I do not want to say that there is never a circumstance, because one could argue all of those points as to why the rate should be 45c instead of 47c or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that it is a legitimate debate to put forward in the Senate the view that the income tax rate on upper income earners should be higher. That is part of the debate Senator Spindler and I have had for three years, because I think we had this same debate on the occasion he moved that amendment. Others in this chamber have had it and will continue to have it. There will be further changes in tax rates and we will have these sorts of debates again, with the opposition saying they are too high or the Democrats saying they are too low or all of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not going to accept these amendments at this time. We are strongly opposed to this as a mechanism for setting, somewhat at random, tax rates separate from an overall strategy. Apart from the constitutional and technical problems with the bill, I think there is a profound policy problem, and we do not support it. </PARA>

The latter would be taxed at a rate of 43c in the dollar and the former at a rate of 47c in the dollar, whereas a person who has an income of $110,000&mdash;a one-income family with eight kids&mdash;would be taxed at the rate proposed in this amendment, 52 per cent. </PARA>

As has been perfectly stated by Senator Spindler in his question to Senator McMullan and in Senator McMullan's response, capacity of the pay is an important aspect.

Perhaps we have stolen the government's thunder in that it might be looking at a similar measure. The Greens do not mind which particular measures the government chooses, but it is a bit rich for the government to suggest that it is irresponsible for the Greens or other parties&mdash;the Australian Democrats or the opposition&mdash;to try to ameliorate some of the poorer considered aspects of the budget because at this stage it will not look at any alternative sources of revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>

The minister also suggested that the problem is that there is too much of a temptation to transfer funds into company tax. Of course, if company tax is 33 per cent, obviously that is a temptation. The problem is not in this kind of proposal. The problem is in the unrealistically low level of company tax that the government has perhaps irresponsibly promised that the community will pay or subsidise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate, and particularly Senator Harradine. I will not repeat what I did at the beginning of my speech on the second reading of the Sales Tax (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and cognate bills, which was to give some of the background to these five sales tax bills. As I said, they were originally part of an omnibus bill. That omnibus bill was split because the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs said unanimously that the bills could well be unconstitutional, as we on this side had claimed all along. As a result, the government was forced in effect to split that omnibus bill&mdash;which would have prevented full and proper debate and consideration of the whole raft of unfair and regressive budget measures that were contained in the bill&mdash;into parts so that we could consider the various parts separately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are now eight bills before the Senate in this group. We are debating five of them. Those five bills are all sales tax bills. Together they propose to implement the budget's sales tax increase measures. There are three key measures in these bills. Firstly, the bills provide for two separate increases in all sales tax rates across the board. Many products that are subject to sales tax, particularly most of the everyday products that people buy, will be subject to an initial 10 per cent tax hike in sales tax and a second 10 per cent tax hike two years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, and also of great concern, these bills provide a massive 55 per cent increase in the sales tax rate applicable to wine, from the existing 20 per cent to 31 per cent. That is a 55 per cent increase in the rate of sales tax on an industry which, until the potential devastation if the bill is passed, had great prospects for export potential. This will pose a massive blow to that prospect. Many of my colleagues in the debate will speak on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third main measure in the sales tax bills is a new and improved system for the operation of the sales tax on luxury motor vehicles. The coalition will support that measure, but we will oppose the other two measures vigorously because they amount to a totally unjustifiable and deceitful grab for money by the government, a grab for which it has no mandate whatsoever. We will be seeking to have the bills amended to delete these unwarranted savage and regressive tax hikes. We will also be moving a second reading amendment condemning these harsh and unjust tax measures. On behalf of the coalition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">", but the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)condemns the Government for including in the bill measures which place in jeopardy the future of Australia's wine industry, and which unnecessarily increase the burden of indirect taxation on the whole Australian community; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)calls on the Government to abandon the measures imposing increases in sales tax on wine and in general rates of sales tax".</PARA>
<PARA>The government has no mandate whatsoever for the sales tax bills now before the house. On the contrary, the government, as the coalition has said consistently, day in and day out, since the budget and before&mdash;right throughout the pre-election campaign and during the election campaign itself&mdash;strenuously ran around promising that there would not be any new tax increases to meet the funding of the personal income tax cuts that it announced in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the budget last year, Treasurer Dawkins said, `We will not be introducing new taxes'. In September last year, when he was introducing the bill to legislate the personal income tax cuts proposed in the One Nation statement he said, `I emphasise that this'&mdash;the income tax cuts&mdash;`will be achieved without resort to any new taxes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of months later, on 19 November, the Prime Minister, (Mr Keating) said, in an interview on the ABC's television program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> with Kerry O'Brien, `What I am promising is not to put up tax'. In the election campaign policy speech of February this year the Prime Minister told the nation, amongst other things, `And with Labor there will be no new big tax increases'. He said that that was a repeat of what he had told the parliament last year in September when he said, `We can pay for our personal tax cuts'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, these bills fly absolutely and totally in the face of the unequivocal promises and commitments that this government made over a lengthy period to deceive the Australian public before and during the 1993 election campaign. They are a deceitful and a very damaging budget measure. They represent a betrayal of the Labor Party's election promises and commitments. The government has no mandate for them. They are, quite simply, bad law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my colleagues wish to speak in this debate on these bills, so I will not detain the Senate too much longer. But I want to read a couple of points into the record in view of the quite scurrilous attacks that have been made by this government, particularly by the Prime Minister, his Treasurer and ministers in this house&mdash;notably and, in particular, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;about the opposition's handling of the budget bills this year. It makes for very interesting reading to look at what Labor luminaries have said in the past about the question of whether the Senate has the right&mdash;moral, constitutional or whatever&mdash;to amend, change or oppose government legislation, particularly in the form of tax bills and sales tax bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his budget response on 25 August 1970, the then Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Gough Whitlam, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me make it clear at the outset that our opposition to this Budget is no mere formality. We intend to press our opposition by all available means and all related measures in both Houses. If the motion is defeated we will vote against the bills here and in the Senate. Our purpose is to destroy this Budget and to destroy the Government which has sponsored it.</PARA>
<PARA>When questioned today in the Senate about Mr Whitlam's statement, Senator Gareth Evans said, `Oh, it was a quixotic statement by a leader 20 years ago'. What absolute nonsense. It was a very definite and accurate statement of Labor Party policy towards this matter. In 1970 one of the leading Labor figures of all time in this Senate&mdash;Senator Lionel Murphy&mdash;said in relation to a similar matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no limitations on the Senate in the use of its constitutional powers, except the limitations imposed by discretion and reason. The Australian Labor Party has acted consistently in accordance with the tradition that we will oppose in the Senate any tax or money Bill, or any other financial measure, whenever necessary, to carry out our principles and policies.</PARA>
<PARA>Just last week, one of Labor's former very distinguished senators&mdash;whom many of us here would know&mdash;ex-Senator John Wheeldon, had something to say about the Prime Minister's pathetic attempt to rewrite history in this area of the role of the Senate in relation to tax bills. John Wheeldon wrote in the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror </EMPHASIS>last Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conflict over the Senate's treatment of a Budget is nothing new. While I was a Labor Senator we repeatedly voted against Coalition Budgets, and I well remember Lionel Murphy, when he was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, announcing that we would defeat the Coalition's Budget and bring the then government down.</PARA>
<PARA>John Wheeldon went on to say in that article last Friday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To claim that there is a convention or a tradition that the Senate is obliged to pass the Budget with or without amendment is completely without historical or legal foundation.</PARA>
<PARA>Those statements echo very closely what the present Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, said when he was in opposition in 1981 and when the then Labor opposition attacked and opposed very savagely and very vigorously the Fraser government's sales tax proposals in that budget. Senator Gareth Evans said a whole raft of things. In a notable second reading debate speech on those bills, he said that there were six points he wanted to make in explaining the then Labor opposition's strong reasons for rejecting the 1981 budget sales tax bills. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, there is a clear distinction in principle between Bills on which the survival of a government depends and those on which it does not. In the former category are crucial money bills, such as the Supply Bills . . . and the Appropriation Bills. In the latter category are not only all non-money bills but also lesser money bills, such as those imposing particular fees or taxes . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to elaborate on that point. Further, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sixth point I want to make is that there can be no question of a mandate of any kind for these particular sales tax bills.</PARA>
<PARA>That was because he claimed that the Fraser government had not given prior indication to the electorate about those bills. If ever a government has failed prior to an election to give any advance notice about its post-election proposals to increase indirect taxes savagely, it is this Keating-Dawkins government. As I said before, everything it said before the election was in contradistinction to the proposition that it would be putting up sales taxes and indirect taxes as a whole. That includes the savage, massive and very destructive fuel tax increases that are proposed in other bills that we will be debating soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a final point made by Senator Gareth Evans in 1981. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final point I make, although it is by no means the least important, is that there is a whole series of precedents in regard to revenue measures in recent Budgets which the Australian Labor Party has voted against in both Houses, without anyone raising cries of inconsistency, hypocrisy or constitutional impropriety.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for the hypocrisy and cant that is going on at the moment from the government about the opposition's handling of these tax bills. We have a responsibility on behalf of the electorate to examine these bills. If we disagree with them, if we believe that the government has no mandate for them and if we regard them as harsh, regressive and unfair, we would be failing our responsibility to the Australian people to do anything other than what we are doing&mdash;that is, to vigorously oppose these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply incorrect&mdash;it is a lie&mdash;for the government to say that defeat of the sales tax bills will somehow or other cause great chaos to the government's financing. We are talking about opposing revenue bills which will bring in 1 1/2 per cent at most of the government's total revenue collections this year. If any government is so incompetent, stupid and maladroit that it cannot adjust its total budget proposals to accommodate that minor reduction in its revenue intake, given that the opposition is allowing it full freedom to pass its expenditure bills&mdash;the appropriation bills&mdash;it does not deserve to be in government and I think that is the only conclusion that one can rightfully draw on this matter. There are a lot of other matters I would like to say; I look forward to leaving them to my colleagues in what will be a very vigorous and very important debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party having won an election on the impact of indirect taxes on Australian families, I find the government's decision to increase sales taxes in this package of bills now before the Senate the height of hypocrisy.

They are regressive taxes and it is not surprising that the government is paying the consequence of this in the opinion polls at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A manufacturer of electrical appliances recently wrote to us about the increase in these wholesale sales taxes. He was concerned that in these recessionary conditions it was inflationary&mdash;prices would increase. He said that the taxes would reduce consumer demand and slow down the recovery as the profit margin is not there to absorb such increases and that they would therefore be passed on with a resultant price increase to the consumer, if possible. Further, he said that this measure will increase the demand for second-hand goods on which sales tax does not apply, lessen the demand for new goods and lead to a reduction in the amount of sales tax collected. He went on to say that it will develop a black market economy dealing in cash and avoiding any payment of tax, whether sales tax or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out to the Senate that in the inner suburban ethnic areas of Melbourne and Sydney the boast is widespread that those people do not pay taxes. They work on the barter system. It is a boast. The PAYE earners are subsidising the black market economy and the barter system, practised by those who have closely knit communities and who can afford to barter and trade outside the Australian Taxation Office network and net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often been asked: what is the status of the collection of tax when the bills have not passed the Senate and when they have not had royal assent? What will be the status of the collection of those moneys in the event of the bills not passing the Senate? As responsible members of the Senate we asked the Australian Tax Office these questions. On 21 September it responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the remittance of the tax goes, at this stage, due to the fact that the bills have not been passed and therefore have not received the royal assent, there is really no tax liability in existence on the rise in the sales tax rates. In actual fact, until the date of royal assent, the penalty provisions are unable to come into existence either. The net effect of that is that the due date for that tax to be returned to the tax office, provided there is passage and royal assent, is 28 days after royal assent.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has always had a date of effect of the actual date that you bring it in but effectively the law does not take over until the royal assent is received and then it has the effect of backdating.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on about the right to charge taxes before the bills have actually been passed. With respect to a supplier charging the tax, the Tax Office says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the law does not go through, then, providing the passing-on provisions are met so the wholesaler returns the tax to the retailer, then the tax office will return the tax to the wholesaler, so the net effect is nil.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the retail end, it is accepted that in a situation where the Senate refused to pass a bill you would have the position that there could well be windfall gains for retailers as a result of the fact that they are not required under the law to pass the tax back. We have advised the government of this, of course, and it is a position that always sits in tax law.</PARA>
<PARA>Following that advice, my colleagues and I gave people the advice that they should certainly keep their documentation from retailers to ensure that they had proof that they had paid the tax in their purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, we are examining five sales tax bills. Four of the bills will amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The fifth bill affects the rate of duty on luxury cars. The coalition is moving to oppose most of these frankly invidious and mendacious increases in the wholesale sales tax. To justify these sales tax increases, the government has drawn our attention to the fact that the indirect tax base has declined sharply over the years. I remind the Senate that the government has demonstrated a cynical, unprincipled lack of will to repair this so-called declining tax base in a fair, equitable and efficient fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look behind the government's statement, we see that what has really happened is that the indirect taxes have increased. It is not surprising, because we have had a raft of new taxes in recent years, such as the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax. There have been substantial increases in the fringe benefits tax. It is not surprising because, as the corporate tax came down to offset the possible movement of benefits through the corporate tax system, the government has had to substantially increase, through the fringe benefits tax regime, the tax rates. It is not surprising that the relationship between the increased collections through the income tax system, as against the indirect tax base, has widened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that that is no excuse for the government to increase the quantum of indirect taxes in the manner in which it has. Increasing indirect sales tax in an extremely arbitrary and capricious manner does not represent a repairing of the sales tax system, as the government alleges. It represents a compounding and exacerbating of the problems that actual bedevil the system of sales tax law in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Neil Warren has cogently articulated the view that the present system is simply incapable of meeting the fiscal demands placed upon it. It is abundantly apparent that the government's action in increasing the sales tax rate belies its words. The government may claim to acknowledge the indirect tax system's problems, but its actions are not those appropriate to such a recognition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These indirect changes do not constitute an attempt to repair&mdash;let alone reform&mdash;the indirect tax regime. Let us not forget that these indirect tax measures have been drafted specifically to attempt to solve the problems solely of the government, problems created by the rampant dissembling that we witnessed just before the election. The fact that these tax increases fail to solve the government's problems, let alone the country's, should surprise no-one. The problem is that these tax increases are solely designed to try to pay for some of the income tax reductions which the government is trying to honour in a very backhanded way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that, starkly contrary to the government's assertions that the promised income tax cuts were self-funding, that is, those that the government has not reneged on, will be 96 per cent funded from other higher direct and indirect taxes over the next four years. I draw the attention of the Senate to the minority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in December 1992 which examined the Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill 1992. At the hearings, we received authoritative evidence from a wide section of the Australian community that the tax cuts were unfunded. The government ignored that to its peril and that is why we have this raft of sales tax legislation, which was not announced prior to the election. That is why the government has no mandate for it. The big problem associated with these sales tax measures is that they add to cost; they cascade down through the stream of production, meaning higher costs for business, higher prices for consumers and a lower standard of living for us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had expressly set out to destroy consumption of domestically produced wine in this country, which is another example of an horrendous tax increase, it could not have done so more effectively than with these planned sales tax increases. Honourable senators might recall that the first tax on wine was levied in about 1984 with a 10 per cent rate. The levy increased to 20 per cent in 1986. Since 1986 domestic consumption of wine has decreased from 21.6 litres per head to 17.6 litres per head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures are important because the unbelievable claim that is being made is that the increase in price will have little impact on wine sales. The government does not even look at history. Unfortunately, the simple point is that when something costs more, people will pay less. The government has not looked at the price elasticity of its taxes on a product such as wine. In fact, a couple of extra dollars in price can be the difference in such a purchase being made or forgone. The reality of wine, as far as consumers are concerned, is that there are clear price ceilings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second fallacy that the government has been assiduously and ineffectively peddling since the budget is that increases in the sales tax on wine will not damage exports. What must be understood&mdash;you would certainly know this, Mr Acting Deputy President, coming from South Australia&mdash;is that the wineries' domestic business underwrites the export business. Without strong domestic sales there is no base for exports. Put simply, one of our most dynamic export industries has been `encouraged' by the federal government with a punitive 55 per cent increase in tax. Truly, only with this Labor government would such behaviour be thinkable&mdash;let alone implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has become internationally competitive because of quality and quality control. Significant cost savings have been achieved by wine producers through rationalisation, associated improvements in the efficiency of operation and as a result of the spreading of overheads. In spite of the significant growth of the export market, it is still the domestic market that is of prime importance to the major companies. It is the domestic market that has enabled wine companies to achieve significant economies of scale in operation to expand into the export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine tax increase immediately calls into question the investment plans of any number of wineries. Two of our largest, Penfolds and Orlando-Wyndham, have already announced reviews of their investment plans if this tax increase is to be effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind the Senate that the government's handling of the Australian economy has not been so adroit that this country can afford to forgo business investment. Indeed, when combined with state liquor licence fees, the Australian wine industry can lay claim to the dubious honour of being the most taxed in the world&mdash;and that is not a great honour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What wineries are threatened by this increase? The larger ones will probably survive by absorbing the impost or somehow dealing with a drop in demand. However, the smaller boutique wineries which produce our most interesting and innovative wines&mdash;that is, the Australian wines that the world cannot get enough of&mdash;will unfortunately disappear. Despite the future being in premium bottled wine, it is the small wineries that will literally be destroyed by this government's desperate and insatiable search for revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read that Senator Richardson said that boutique wineries are dispensable. I put it to Senator Richardson that competitive export oriented businesses contribute more to our national wealth than we do as politicians. </PARA>

Is an extra $79 million in revenue worth such a trade-off? How much consideration has been given to the fact that the downturn in demand caused by the wine tax increase could well result in negative net effects on revenue?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wonder how much thought has been given to the damage that this measure will do to parts of regional Australia where the wine industry is based. My colleagues from South Australia, such as Senator Minchin and others, will give examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will use the remaining minutes of my allotted time to speak about my state of Tasmania. The wine industry in Tasmania now has some 90 to 100 growers. This includes more than 25 fully commercial operators employing about 100 people full-time and 300 to 400 part-time and casual people. This year the local industry harvested 1,200 tonnes of grapes and produced more than one million bottles of wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanian wineries produce small volumes of high quality wines which are marketed at the higher end of the market. About 75 per cent of the product is sold locally and about 20 per cent is sold interstate. Currently it is estimated that only five per cent of wines produced in Tasmania are exported overseas. It needs to be remembered that in contrast to the brewing industry, which is owned multinationally and mass produces a beverage whose main raw material is water, the wine industry in my state is owned locally by Tasmanians and produces a high value added product from an intensely managed, vulnerable crop into which growers often invest their life savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is but another example of the government's rhetoric being belied by its actions. The government purports to be greatly concerned with the problems faced by regional Australia.

Here is another example of a tax that will damage regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that we have a minister for regional development, which is an echo of the Whitlam government's Fabian fantasies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My state of Tasmania provides a marvellous example of this. Wine is perhaps Tasmania's most successful new industry.

Despite Tasmania's urgent need for such business activity, my state Labor colleagues have not uttered one word in defence of their constituents, who are crying out for their help. I find it very interesting that people with normally a great deal to say on any number of topics appear to have been struck dumb on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) threatening the wine industry with an excise for which he claims he does not need parliamentary authority. These are blackmail tactics towards the industry. These sorts of hysterical and shrill threats are not only unbecoming of a minister of the crown; they demonstrate the Treasurer's jaundiced view of liberal democracy. The Treasurer's understanding of Australian democracy is that if people have the temerity not to agree with the government, its ministers threaten the compulsory exaction of property without legislative authority.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Study noted that lower production costs are vital if grape growers are to improve their profitability, therefore ensuring a sufficient return on investment which is critical to ensuring the longer term supply of wine grapes to the wineries. In stating this, Arthur D Little also commented that the wine grape resource base is currently constrained by the lack of capital, and that the industry needed support if it is to achieve sustainable success in international markets.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to contribute briefly to this debate. Honourable senators might think it is strange, but there are wineries in the Canberra area. There are some 32 small businesses growing grapes or making wine. Not all of them are within the boundaries of the Australian Capital Territory but they are certainly within this region. It is a matter of considerable concern that the wineries should be attacked in this way by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was thinking only this afternoon, can honourable senators imagine what the Labor Party would say if somebody in the community, for example an insurance company, put up its premiums 55 per cent. Can one imagine how those opposite would carry on in this place about anybody putting anything up by 55 per cent. That is what the government is doing to the wine industry with absolute reckless disregard for the future of the industry and, in particular, the small companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to a letter that I received from one of the wineries locally. I will probably seek to incorporate it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> without the names of the people concerned. That letter sets out the impact this measure will have on that particular company. The company has recently expanded to the extent that it has employed one person to help in the vineyard. It is a small company that otherwise, up until now, has managed by doing the work itself. That is one fellow who will lose his job. One wonders how much will be paid out in unemployment benefits to compensate for incidents like this where people will be thrown out of work as a consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that impresses me about this letter is the fact that the principals of the company say that the right solution for them, having worked to get their vineyard to the stage that it now is, where they are able to pay tax and participate and live a bit above the poverty line for themselves, is to allow the production to drop back so that they are not paying sales tax at all; so that their level of activity drops below that. They have worked out what impact this tax will have upon them. It is disproportionately harsh on the smaller companies. I find it remarkable, indeed, that the government is not in the least mindful of what it is doing. As far as I am concerned, it has given no justifiable explanation for what is a very harsh tax. I seek the leave of the Senate to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that portion of the letter to which I referred. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this has changed with the draconian and counterproductive increase in sales tax on wine introduced in the 1993 budget. We are faced with an increase of 55% in our sales tax bill. This was already the dominant cost factor in our operation, dwarfing production costs, fruit growing costs, and our personal income. We are faced with two alternatives:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Increase the price of our wines by the increase in sales tax. This is at best income neutral, we will certainly sell less wine and most likely suffer a reduced gross income, and still have to face a hugely increased sales tax bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Try to absorb the increase and so maintain sales volume. Again we will have to foot a greatly increased sales tax bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In either case, or even some compromise position, we will have to pay up to 55% more sales tax. This means several things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Our vineyard worker will have to go&mdash;the Treasurer can pay him out of the sales tax impost, and spend even more money on trying to find him another job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. We will reduce our production to minimise our sales tax bill, even to falling below the threshold if possible. That way we can cope with the work unaided, and the Federal Government won't collect any sales tax revenue from us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. Just when it looked like we might start paying income tax after all these years, the increased sales tax bill makes that further away than ever. We will continue to be classified as below the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. Export is now a pipe dream.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an old fable about the goose that laid golden eggs; you can only eat the goose once, it is much better to have a golden egg every day. The wine industry is a little like that goose, it is efficient, successful and productive, generating sales tax revenue, earning good export dollars, contributing to our tourism industry and employing rural workers. Imposing a punitive sales tax is going to harm it. You might like to consider extrapolating our circumstances to the 600 or so other small and medium sized wineries; is this job creation? Is this encouraging small business? Is this helping Australia's trade deficit? Is this in fact the Tall Poppy syndrome as practised by the Federal Treasury?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian wine industry is one of the few showing strong export growth. This cannot be sustained without a strong and stable domestic base. The enormous increase in the sales tax bill will reduce domestic sales and decrease profitability. This will deter investment in the industry, cause extensive labour force reductions and send some small businesses out of production. This is hardly the recipe for continued export expansion. Furthermore, higher prices at the top of the market will increase competition from imports, often mistakenly seen as quality products. Increased sales of imported wines will tend to nullify the balance of payments effect of forcing an increase in (sales tax free) wine exports. Incidentally, the increased revenue supposedly derived from this new sales tax level is intended to cover the cost of some generous export support schemes offered to our major companies&mdash;a rather dubious quid pro quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 budget proposal to increase sales tax on wine by 55% is counter-productive; it threatens the livelihood of all small wineries, and encourages the concentration of the industry into even fewer major companies who have the means to minimise sales tax liability and who have large enough export operations to qualify for the export support schemes funded by the Federal Government. The result may well be a decrease in the net revenue collected from this source. I ask you to use your influence and political judgement to enforce a rethink by our Treasurer, having the capacity to impose amendments to the budget proposals in the Senate.</PARA>

We sought the opportunity to speak very briefly on the minority report which was included in the standing committee report tabled this morning. This was denied by the government and we then sought to suspend standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate continued as usual for half an hour. The government, rather than allowing Senator Watson and me to take up between eight and 10 minutes each, decided that we would have a debate on the suspension for half an hour. The substance of the government's opposition to allowing a debate on this report for eight to 10 minutes was that the government said it would set a dangerous precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coates is the chairman of the committee and, as I have said before, despite many differences with him, he is regarded as being a stickler for rules and precedents. Among other things, he said that honourable senators should oppose this motion because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is particularly important that we draw the line at this point and say that we must not set a precedent and upset this process.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator Watson and I were trying to set a precedent which he thought would cause problems for the arrangement of government business in the Senate in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner, however, tended to use very strong language and rhetoric in his speech concerning this attempt by Senator Watson and me to set new precedents. He said, among other things, with a lot of flourishes:</PARA>

<PARA>He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge senators not to support this absurd, ridiculous and time-wasting motion.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Senator Faulkner argued that this was a precedent and that it would cause a problem if Senator Watson and me were allowed to speak for eight minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was intrigued as to whether this was in fact an attempt to set a new precedent by Senator Watson and me. I did not believe it was. My memory was that other senators had used this procedure, but I did not have the information on hand at that time. I have been able to have some research done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to tell Senator Faulkner and Senator Coates that there are quite a number of examples where senators&mdash;I have to say government senators&mdash;have sought leave of the Senate to speak on standing committee reports that have been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw their attention, for example, to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report on certain provisions of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 which was tabled by Senator Zakharov who sought leave to make a statement on that report. There are a number of other examples including the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs report on Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill 1991, which Senator Zakharov again tabled and sought leave to make a statement on; and the Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure report on the National Road Transport Commission Bill 1991 which was tabled in the Senate and on which Senator Panizza then sought and was granted leave to make a short statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other examples but I will not take up any more of the Senate's time. These examples clearly show that the procedure which Senator Watson and I were attempting to use has been used before&mdash;indeed, it has been used by government senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all understand the politics of the numbers; we can understand the government's nervousness on this particular bill; but what concerned me was the quite extravagant language used by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, who alleged that this was a dastardly attempt to establish new precedents and so forth. It was regrettable that the Australian Democrats heard this rather windy language of Senator Faulkner and were persuaded to vote with the government on that occasion. I think therein lies a good lesson for us all, but particularly for the Democrats, that one has to be very careful in accepting the windy language and rhetoric of Senator Faulkner on these particular issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a matter of huge seriousness except that there is a need to have a bit of confidence in the capacities of the Manager of Government Business because it is a very important post in this chamber. I would urge Senator Faulkner, who is comparatively new at the job and who undoubtedly has some time to run before he fully travels the learning curve, that it would be very wise for him to check carefully with the clerks before he comes into this chamber and makes these very strong statements, particularly about precedents. Then he will not mislead senators who may be wavering on these particular issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On 24 April 1991, the Customs (Detention and Search) Act 1990, commonly known as the `frisk' legislation came into effect after passing through Parliament with strong support from both the Government and the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation which authorised a more comprehensive range of detention and search powers for both Customs and Police, was in response to public concern at the increasing dangers of illegal drug importations and strong evidence of an increasing trend to bring drugs into the country concealed on the body. In 1992/93, in-bound travelling airline passengers accounted for some 15% of all drugs seized by the ACS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the current legislation is that it expressly provides protection, rights and obligations for both suspects and officers alike. In addition, Customs' operating directions and procedures for personal search are designed to reflect a reasonable balance between preserving a person's dignity and liberty and the protection of the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Customs Service (ACS) has a very difficult job in exercising its control function to detect those persons intent on deliberately circumventing the laws of Australia designed for the protection of the community and the economy. It is an unfortunate fact that some people will use almost any means imaginable to import prohibited goods into Australia. This means that sometimes Customs is obliged to carry out a personal search to confirm that a person is not concealing any such goods on their body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACS is acutely aware of the sensitivity of its legislative powers to detain a person for personal search and does not take its responsibilities lightly. Its officers are trained to ensure that all examinations undertaken are both necessary and thorough. Personal searches are not conducted on a routine or random basis. A detention officer must have reasonable grounds for his/her suspicions and there are strict procedures in place that respect a person's rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the basis for selection includes such things as a person's travel itinerary, answers to question, documents in possession, unusual behaviour and the contents or appearance of the person's baggage. These grounds are in accordance with the detention and search provisions of the Customs Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Personal search records are maintained in strict accordance with the information privacy principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988. Database systems which assist with enforcement profiling do not identify any personal details for "nil" result searches. The ACS does maintain a "Register of Persons Searched" at each airport. It is a strictly confidential document and access to information it contains by outside agencies or persons is subject to the confidentiality provisions of the Customs Administration Act and the Privacy Act. This register does not record a person's nationality, visa details or what was their purpose for travel.
