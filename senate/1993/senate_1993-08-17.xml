Senator Crichton-Browne comes well qualified for this position. As you know, Mr President, not only has he served as one of your acting deputy presidents and temporary chairmen of committees but he has also given long and distinguished service on both Senate and joint committees of this parliament; and, from the position of opposition, he has been the deputy chairman on several of those committees.

The President, of course, is also a strong supporter of this institution and, with both of those honourable senators there at the helm, I think this will be very much appreciated by the people of Australia who regard this chamber as a necessary chamber of review and Senator Crichton-Browne's work as Chairman of Committees will be very vital to the exercise of that function by members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

I appreciate the support of the Australian Democrats on this occasion and I promise that I will be brief in the remarks that I make.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to provide for questions without notice to be called on today.</PARA>
<PARA>It is incredible that members of the House of Representatives today have the opportunity to question ministers, yet in this place the government has failed to provide us with an opportunity for question time. All I can get from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) as to why this is so is that today is a day of ceremony. Today is not just a day of ceremony. We have just had many senators giving notices of motion; petitions have been presented in this place; we are about to have the tabling of documents. This is a day of ceremony but it is also a normal day of business. We should be entitled today, on the first day back here, to ask ministers the question that we wish to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be a test&mdash;the first test of this sitting&mdash;for the Australian Democrats and the Greens. If they are here to help keep this government honest, they will want to question and probe this government now at the first opportunity, and they will vote with us to suspend standing orders in order that we may be able to do so. If the Democrats and the Greens say, `No, we are too busy having afternoon tea' or whatever and are uninterested in this matter, unwilling to come in here and take the opportunity to question the government, they will do what we suspect they will do; that is, vote with the government and not take up this opportunity. We give notice by this action today that we intend to take every opportunity to probe and question this incompetent government. Our first opportunity is now, and that is why I have moved this motion. The government may well say, `But we have our minds on the budget and you will simply want to ask budget questions'. That is not correct. There are so many other issues before the Australian people that we want to probe and question. For example, there is the inaction of the federal government in relation to the Mabo decision&mdash;the total incompetence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his unwillingness to draw the state premiers together in a way which would seek a constructive resolution of the very major difficulties that come out of that High Court decision. Why are we not being permitted today to question the government in relation to its handling of the Mabo issue?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a limp and flatulent little effort from Senator Hill&mdash;full of wind and fulmination but without any substance whatsoever. He should know perfectly well&mdash;and he does know because I have told him&mdash;that it has been absolutely standard practice in this place, whoever has been in government, for as long as I can remember and certainly for as far back as I have checked, which is to 1976, not to have a question time on the first day back for a new Senate when a Senate is being sworn in and when a new President and Deputy President are being elected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a party which goes on at such nauseous length about history, tradition, norms, forms, standards, procedures and conventions in this place, it is the height of rank hypocrisy for Senator Hill to come in here and seek to tear up those conventions and practices as they have evolved over many years. They have evolved for very good reason. We have 11 new senators in this place, 10 of whom were newly sworn in today. They are here with their families and they want the opportunity to behave in a way that is appropriate without the kind of exercise that Senator Hill wants us to engage in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make very clear for the record that this has been the practice. If one looks back at what the practice has been every election year going back to 1976, one will find that there was no question time on the first day back in these situations in 1990, 1987 or 1981&mdash;and I will fill in the gap in a moment&mdash;and nor was there in 1978 or 1976. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as 1983 was concerned, honourable senators may recall that there was a double dissolution. That meant that the new Senate was sworn in earlier than the start-up of the parliament on the budget day in the August session. So normal question time did take place on the budget day return date for the Senate in that particular election year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, there was no question time in 1985 because the election for the new Senate had taken place back in the latter part of 1984 and budget time in 1985 was in fact the first day back for the new Senate. It was dealt with in that way following that particular election. That has been the practice, the history and the tradition for the very good practical reason that I have already described. As I have already said publicly, this is in the dim hope that there will be some improvement in Senate standards in future and that Senator Hill will find more credible grounds for his attempt at procedural disruptions. </PARA>

This Senate and the House of Representatives have sat for one month in eight months of this year. If the Australian Democrats cannot find some questions to throw at the government, they must be very happy with the government's performance. But I can tell the Democrats that 80 per cent of the people out there in Australia are most dissatisfied with the government. They want to know what the government intends to do on so many issues, such as on the unemployment issue. One million people out there are unable to get a job. Hundreds of thousands of kids are bottled up in tertiary education, on pretend jobs, and they want to get a real genuine job.

If the Democrats want to have a cup of tea then they should go out there and have one, but let us get on with the debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these programming matters were circulated to honourable senators, including the opposition, weeks ago. The draft red order of business that Senator Hill is now in high dudgeon about was received by him on 10 August but he is a bit thick and a bit slow to wake up. Apparently he has woken up today to the fact that, in accordance with precedence and convention, there is no question time. Under my signature as Manager of Government Business, we clearly indicated what the Senate program would be for this week, and those opposite all know it. This is just pathetic grandstanding from people who are destroyers not builders&mdash;the people who have decided that there is nothing left for them in Australian politics other than to be negative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, this motion is for the suspension of standing orders. I would have thought that the government would have realised that if it did not agree with the suggestion that we should have a question time, half an hour would be taken up in this chamber debating the suspension of standing orders so that we could have a question time. I do not know when the government was given advice of this, but I suggest that it would have been reasonable for the government to have agreed with that. This afternoon we were not going to resume until 3.30; but we resumed at 3.15. The government would have only lost a quarter of an hour&mdash;and what is a quarter of an hour between friends and people who need an idea that this parliament is being run properly? If only a quarter of an hour is involved, I do not see that it is a disruptive measure, but now it has become slightly disruptive because of the intransigence of the government in refusing to accede to the request for a question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a question time is necessary today. Why should it be necessary? Because I believe that we are in crisis in this country today. That crisis was highlighted after we received Senator Faulkner's letter outlining what the procedures were going to be here. That was last Thursday, 12 August, when the unemployment figures came out showing continuous record unemployment levels; a loss in one month of 37,000 full-time jobs; and that every Australian losing a job now, on average, will be unemployed for 58 weeks&mdash;and in Tasmania 80 weeks. If that is not a crisis, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked the opportunity to ask questions about certain things of the minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I believe that many people in this country, many ordinary people in the community, do not believe that we are in a recession; they believe that we are in a painful transition to a situation of continuous drops in the standard of living, with a permanent underclass of unemployed and underemployed. If that is not a crisis for which the government should be asked questions, I do not know what is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have raised question after question about the need for the government to look at the paid work force, and to see who is in the paid work force who wants to come out of it and who has better reason to come out of it. Thousands of people in the 50 to 60 age group, where there now are many unemployed, want to retire but cannot because they would be faced with an unacceptable loss in their standard of living. Why force those people to stay in the paid work force when there are so many outside wanting to get in there and take those jobs? Again, there are thousands of mothers with young dependent children who, if they were given true freedom of choice, would want to come out of the paid work force but cannot because one-income families are discriminated against and will be discriminated against in respect of the home child care allowance.</PARA>

<PARA>Condor Laucke was born in 1914 at Greenock, South Australia and was educated at Immanuel College and the School of Mines. Prior to entering state politics he worked in the family flour and feed milling business at Greenock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was interested in politics from a young age, becoming secretary of the Greenock branch of the Liberal and Country League in 1933. He entered the South Australia House of Assembly as the member for Barossa in 1956 and served there for nine years. From 1962 to 1965 he held the position of government whip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1967 Sir Condor entered federal parliament as senator for South Australia. His time in the Senate was characterised by his good humour and unfailing courtesy toward his colleagues on both sides of the chamber. It was these qualities that led to his election as President of the Senate in 1976 and he filled this position with distinction until his retirement in 1981. He was universally well regarded and praised for his honesty, his sense of fair play and his personal charm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Condor Laucke was President of the Senate during my first three years in this place, and I personally remember him very well and very affectionately. He insisted, of course, as those on the other side still would if they had the chance, on wearing his full regalia of lace jabot, cuffs and ruffles and full bottomed wig, which made him look, as can be seen from his portrait in the Members' Hall, rather like a rakish, elderly gentleman in a Restoration comedy. He obviously thought I was a bit of a wild young man, particularly in my attitudes to the Senate, but he seemed to nurture the hope that I would grow more moderately and gracefully disposed towards the institution as I grew older in it. I am sorry to have disappointed him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was temporary Chairman of Committees from 1969 to 1972 and served on several committees including the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House of which he was joint Chairman and on which I worked closely with him. He also represented Australia at several parliamentary conferences overseas. In 1979 Sir Condor received his knighthood in recognition of his distinguished parliamentary service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He retired from federal politics in 1981 and in 1982 was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia and held this post until last year.

On behalf of the government, I extend our sincere sympathy to his wife, Rose, and the family in their bereavement. </PARA>

He began his political career in 1933 at the age of 19 as the secretary of the Greenock branch of the newly formed Liberal and Country League. He was elected to the South Australian state parliament in 1956 and represented the interests of the people of the Barossa Valley for nine years until 1965. He showed particular dedication to the region's German heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Condor made an outstanding contribution to the federal parliament during his time as a Liberal senator for South Australia from 1967 to 1981. He served with distinction on many committees, including as Chairman for two years of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment, as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution, and as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Off-shore Petroleum Resources. His contribution, Mr President, as you know, included holding the important office of President of the Senate from 1976 to 1981. I was honoured to succeed him into the Senate upon his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His interest in and support for the Barossa did not wane during his time in federal politics. In 1975, he was one of the founders of the Barons of the Barossa, the fraternity of winemakers dedicated to promoting the Barossa Valley.

Sir Condor Laucke had a long and distinguished career in South Australia state and federal politics. With his election as the secretary of the Greenock branch of the Liberal and Country League at the young age of 19, Sir Condor embarked on what was to become a lifetime involvement in politics.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Condor made a successful transition from state to federal politics when he entered the Senate in 1967 as a Liberal senator for South Australia. His nine years of hard work and his intrinsic integrity and decency were formally recognised by his parliamentary peers when he was elected President of the Senate in 1976. Sir Condor served five fruitful years in the office of President. One of his greatest achievements was his success in restoring peace and order to a place where turmoil had previously raged. Describing himself as a progressive conservative, Sir Condor was an ardent advocate for the pre-eminence of the Westminster system and parliamentary convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981, after 48 years' commitment to politics, Sir Condor resigned his Senate position. However, he found himself unable to settle down to his family flour business, sheep farming and rose growing pursuits that would more than adequately occupy most retirees. Unable to curtail his extraordinary drive and energy, these retirement activities were promptly abandoned when he was summoned back into public life to take up the position of lieutenant-governor for South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a further 10 years Sir Condor worked tirelessly to further the interests of his home state and the people of South Australia. Sir Condor served the people of South Australia for the majority of his life. As a state member, a senator in the Australian parliament, President of the Senate and finally Lieutenant-Governor for South Australia, his integrity and dedication has been admired by many but has been emulated by very few. I am sure that all honourable senators will join me in extending our sympathy to his widow and family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join the Australian Democrats with this motion of condolence and speak briefly about Sir Condor Laucke, an ex-senator from South Australia. I never knew Sir Condor Laucke; he was only a name to me. Reading through some of the material which I obtained from the Department of the Parliamentary Library, it is clear that Sir Condor showed several very endearing features in his character. He was quite clearly a gentleman in every sense of the word. He was spoken of repeatedly, both in the pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and in numerous newspaper cuttings, as somebody who was always fair, generous and a thoroughly decent sort of man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that comes through very clearly is that he was clearly a practical person. I was amused and delighted when I read an article which appeared in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> in 1967 under the heading `The Miller of Greenock' and which said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young Laucke learnt more from his father than how to run a flour mill. He learnt something about the handling of men.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"We hope that our men have always worked with us and not for us," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>That said something to me about Sir Condor Laucke. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Laucke is married, with two children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is now managing director of the family flour milling business, which also has mills at Strathalbyn, Angaston, Stockwell and Eudunda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He'll still take a load of feed to poultry farmers himself when the pressure is on at the mill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enterprising poultry owners ring him for advice. He keeps more than 300 fowls himself to see how they progress on the feed made by his mills.</PARA>
<PARA>I was impressed reading that, again not knowing the man, for here was a very practical man who knew quite a lot in detail about flour milling and the mixing of poultry feed and who mucked in with his workers to deliver material from his business to those with whom he supplied material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other little piece from the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of December 1978, which I think shed a very interesting light on another aspect of Sir Condor's character, was the occasion on which he was notified that a knighthood would be bestowed upon him. Evidently, according to this account, headed `A tear, some wine, then off yabbying', he went down into the cellar of his house, broke out a bottle of `78 Bundawunda&mdash;the name of his home&mdash;Rhine riesling, drank that and went off with his two grandchildren to catch yabbies in the local dam. Again, I was very moved that here was clearly a man who took both triumph and disaster, as Rudyard Kipling said, and treated them both the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other pieces from the library which I think shed a very interesting light on the personality and integrity of Sir Condor were the speeches which were made at the time of his accession to the presidency of the Senate. On that occasion&mdash;honourable senators should remember that this was a liberal government&mdash;Senator Withers, who moved the motion, said of then Senator Laucke:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have a long and distinguished record of committee service including the chairmanship of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment from 1971 to 1973 and membership of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and the famous Senate Select Committee on Offshore Petroleum Resources.

Nobody would be more respected around the Parliament in a personal sense than yourself.

<PARA>And so it goes on. Clearly, here was a man being elected to the position which you now hold, Mr President, who had shown himself over many years, both in state parliament and in the federal sphere in the Senate, as a person of great integrity, great fairness and great honesty. Those words were also reflected in a speech by Senator Wriedt, who spoke on behalf of the opposition, the now government. He said:</PARA>

When I heard of his death I was very sad and also very sad that I could not attend his funeral in South Australia. I had to attend a meeting of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards. I thought to myself, `Would Condor rather me be at his funeral or rather me question the chairman of the Film Board of Review to ascertain where it is currently drawing the line in regard to extremely sexually violent material and R-rated videos?'.

He did it in a very fine and nice way; those of us who were here know what I mean. He was always polite and courteous to his staff or to anybody with whom he came in contact. His Christian charity and his generosity were legend. I recall very clearly one occasion when this came to the fore. After my first wife died I was taking six of the children through South Australia and wanted to go through the Barossa Valley.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak on this condolence motion for Sir Condor Laucke not so much as a political colleague but as someone who had a personal relationship with him. Sir Condor has been described as a popular political and business figure in South Australia. Anyone who knew him would very much ascribe the word `popular' to him. He had a distinguished service in this place, in the state parliament and as Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia; and, of course, he was quite prominent in business in South Australia, particularly in the Barossa Valley.

In that context, it is strange for someone with my politics to claim that he was someone with whom I had a personal relationship. Sir Condor was very much a man of the people, and it is in that context that I first came across him. I must state that at the time that I met him I would not have been over the age of 10 or 11. Condor was then a state member of parliament in South Australia. At the same time he was still running his flour mill in Greenock. Through that flour mill he had a very close relationship with a couple of bakers at the continental bakery in Adelaide who were very close to my father. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through them, a friendship developed, very much because of the culture and laws of the time. We had 6 o'clock closing at that time. Dad had a shop next to the Cumberland Arms Hotel where, after the pub had closed, people would drop in for a drink before they went home. Condor would escape from the state parliament and come and meet with the Platis brothers and have a drink in the shop. On a number of occasions I thought to myself that his usefulness in parliament would not have been all that great, having spent a few hours in the greengrocer's shop having a quiet drink amongst friends. Condor would come quite frequently and spend time and talk with people who were very much not part of the Liberal party in that state, not part of the Barossa Valley society and not part of the business community, but people with whom he felt a very strong affinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions I would go into the shop late at night, after having allegedly finished homework, to see that not only had they had a few beers but also that they had managed to knock off most of the vegetables, having got drunk after a few drinks. The sort of character that Sir Condor had, allowed him to interact quite freely with people&mdash;spend a lot of time with them and pay a lot of attention to them&mdash;and to enjoy himself in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one of those occasions that I met him he took an interest in me and talked about his life in parliament. He even suggested, as someone had suggested to him, that maybe he would see me in parliament&mdash;I think that is close to his words. He did not. I came in as Sir Condor left this place, but we did, as the batch of incoming senators in 1981, enjoy some of his hospitality and, of course, the famous Barossa Valley wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in the family context that we got to meet both Rose and Sir Condor's daughter, Rosemary. From time to time they also dropped in to share evenings of friendship as an escape, probably, from parliament. Those of us who spend evenings in parliament or a place like this can quite appreciate the attraction Sir Condor would have felt for getting out of it and spending time with people talking about basic things from football to life and whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I missed Sir Condor in this place&mdash;I was never a political colleague&mdash;but his impact on my life through example is something that I have remembered for the best part of 25 to 30 years, if not more.

I am very saddened by the loss of a dear friend and a person I respected enormously as an individual South Australian, as a father of his family, as a Liberal senator and as one who has contributed to my state enormously in all of the fields that have been mentioned, especially by Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Hill when introducing this condolence motion here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended the funeral and memorial service. The church was packed. Many current senators, especially from South Australia, and former senators were present. Mr President, you were very much with us, as were former presidents McClelland and O'Byrne. I noted some of Condor's immediate peers&mdash;Gordon Davidson, Sir Harold Young, Don Jessop and Peter Ray. I know that they have a special, fond regard for their friend, especially remembering the years they served together in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I attended the funeral I was struck by the authentic Lutheran service&mdash;the reading of scripture and, as the words of the service said, the consolation of the Christian in seeing death as an entry to a continuing life in paradise. The singing by a choir of Barossa residents, especially from the town of Tanunda, was a very moving part of the service. The eulogy given by the former Governor of South Australia, Sir Donald Dunstan, summed up all our thoughts admirably. He was our Governor in South Australia for about nine years. In all that time, Sir Condor was his deputy as the Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first occasion on which I met Sir Condor was at his own home when I was 21 and attending his daughter's 21st birthday. Rosemary was amongst a set of friends from her mid-teenage years until now. I was delighted to go to the family home. At that time, Sir Condor had served 10 years as the member for Barossa in the state parliament. He moved on from there to be a federal senator for some 14 years and, of course, for the last five or six of those years, he was a very distinguished President of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very glad that my son, Joshua, who is now 18, especially asked that he might attend the funeral with me and so we went together. He was three when I began in the Senate. Joshua remembers that every time he came to the Senate as a toddler&mdash;he came several times a year&mdash;Sir Condor was kind and welcoming not only to him but also to his baby brother&mdash;and eventually to all three of our sons&mdash;and my wife. It was endearing that we came as a family when we came to the rooms of the President of the Senate. That graciousness, courtesy, cheerfulness and kindness was extended not only to colleagues such as me&mdash;a South Australian, a Liberal&mdash;but also, I believe, to all of us in the Senate chamber. Senator Gareth Evans, who is nodding in agreement, started on the same day as I did, and he and others have said that of Sir Condor as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we attended the funeral, I recalled the delight in my small sons' eyes when they first saw this wonderful man. He looked somewhat like Father Christmas. He had lace in his cuffs and on the front of his beautiful clothes, a wig, and gracious rooms. I soon discovered that he was the first President to have his own wine. When we were his guests it was a delight to drink Bunawunda red and white. I still have a bottle or two of that wine that he gave to me. On an appropriate anniversary, or when Lady Rose or the family visits our home, we will remember through this wine the graciousness of a fine man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the word that Sir Donald most emphasised in his recollections of his close colleague and deputy governor. That word was `integrity'. This is the word that comes to our mind when we think of his time here in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two incidents that I wish to recall briefly. The first occurred in my first month in the Senate when I had to make my first real political decision. I had to decide whether I would vote against a budget bill of the government. Those who are aware of my speech in September 1978 will note that I commended the Fraser government, of which I was a backbench member. I drew particular attention to one element of the budget of that year which I regarded as a mistake and a penalty upon the people of South Australia&mdash;not least, a penalty on the grape growers of the Barossa Valley. There was to be a massive increase in the brandy excise. As honourable senators know, brandy is made from grapes that are left over. Those grapes, which are sold for a low price, can be used for the production of straight alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the grape growers of South Australia were suffering, my government was going to impose a bigger tax on brandy, which would have meant that less brandy would have been sold and stocks would have grown. I had gone through the econometric models. It was demonstrated to me overwhelming that this decision would be counterproductive to the tax collection revenue plans of the Fraser Government. I believed this so strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Condor, our colleagues and I made up a special delegation to the Prime Minister. This was the first time I had ever visited a Prime Minister's office. At that time&mdash;not now&mdash;Malcolm Fraser was a forbidding, tall, quiet, difficult Prime Minister for a young back bencher to face. Because I was fired up and they had heard my arguments, my colleagues asked me and put the case, which I did, I thought, clearly and logically. There was no response. After there had been some other discussions, the Prime Minister said, `This is an integral part of the budget. The budget is whole and it is, rightly or wrongly, to be supported'. We left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then had to contemplate whether, in my first months as a senator&mdash;and following my remarks in my first speech, which I thought were very appropriate, about the 99 that were safe and the one that was endangered&mdash;I would cross the floor on the brandy bill. My good friend Sir Condor took me aside and said, `Baden, you have done everything that can be expected of a senator. You have argued the case. You have talked about it with your colleagues. You have put it to the government. It is unreasonable to expect that you would need to demonstrate your case by crossing the floor and voting against your colleagues'. I took the weight of that advice very much into account when I did not vote against the budget measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, the brandy excise was counterproductive and there was less revenue raised. I was grateful for the counsel of older and wiser members, especially when, as a 33-year-old Liberal senator, I was gung-ho to support my own state to the upmost against such a measure. As I said, there was a convincing case not to support this measure. With every personal courtesy, Sir Condor gave to me a wiser political perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with a very warm heart that I think about Lady Rose and her cheerfulness, her smile and the life that she brought to their marriage and to their family, and then the way in which Condor then projected the same cheerfulness to us all. I can recount a number of times when Lady Rose added so much by being with Sir Condor when he was President of the Senate. Illustrative of this was one occasion when they were representing Australia in the Republic of South Korea. The President of the Senate attended an illustrious dinner as the guest of the President of South Korea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, politics in South Korea was a very serious affair and it was understood by many that the President of South Korea never smiled. Lady Rose was seated next to the President of Korea and it did not take more than half a minute before he was totally relaxed. All of the other Korean guests said what a person this person from South Australia must be if she can so change the normal style of such a serious man. It was of no surprise to me to hear such excellent reports of the way in which Lady Rose, by her ordinary conversation and her direct cheerfulness, made a very human and totally successful evening of such a visit in which her husband was representing Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with my colleagues, I express my sympathy to Lady Rose, Rosemary, young Condor and all of the family, to all the friends and neighbours in Greenock and the Barossa Valley and throughout the whole of the South Australia&mdash;a state that Sir Condor served so admirably. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had known Condor for some years prior to that, both as a friend of members of my family and through our respective involvement in the Liberal Party in South Australia. He was ever ready to give advice to a young budding politician. Indeed, one of my many memories which stand out was when Condor accompanied me the first time I made a public speech as an endorsed Liberal candidate. This was when I shared with him a place on the Liberal Senate ticket in South Australia for 1974 double dissolution federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well recall a brisk trip in his Alfa Romeo sports car from Adelaide to Victor Harbour to join the then member for Barker, the Hon.

His love for Australia and his concern for Australia's future at that time under the Whitlam government, as well as his commitment to the Liberal Party and his shrewd and sound political judgment, became very evident to me on that journey to and from Victor Harbour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am simply referring to a report. I am not taking that as being the case; I am saying that, if it was the case, Labor senators grossly underestimated Sir Condor. Sir Condor was known and admired by all for his politeness and courtesy, for his patience and decency, as other colleagues have said in speaking to this condolence motion today. These are qualities which are perhaps too often absent in the daily rough and tumble of politics. Perhaps if his election as President was as described in that newspaper report, those Labor senators of 1976 mistook those qualities exemplified by Sir Condor for weakness on his part. They could not have been more mistaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a long period Sir Condor demonstrated his strength as a successful businessman and politician representing South Australia. He was born in 1914, and having been educated at Immanuel College and the School of Mines in Adelaide, he returned to his beloved Greenock in the Barossa Valley to join the flour and feed milling business which his father had bought in 1899. He later became managing director of that business and successfully extended its operation to various parts of South Australia before turning his hand to parliamentary politics. This followed many years as an office bearer in the Liberal Party in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He won the seat of Barossa in the House of Assembly in the South Australian Parliament in 1956 serving three terms there, a total of nine years, until his defeat in 1965. Barossa was originally a rural seat which, over the years during which Sir Condor represented it, gradually became subsumed into the metropolitan area by the growth of the suburbs to the north-east of Adelaide, this growing urbanisation completely changing the character of Barossa into a marginal metropolitan seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Condor's loss in 1965, which accompanied the first ever defeat of the long serving Playford LCL government in that state, was therefore no negative reflection on his own effort or ability. Indeed, on the contrary, between 1962 and 1965 he served as government whip and was regarded by many of his colleagues in the state parliament as a potential future leader of the South Australian Liberal parliamentary party, the LCL as it then was, and hence a future premier of South Australia. Sadly, his defeat in 1965 prevented that potential being realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, Sir Condor was noted for his politeness, courtesy and gentlemanly restraint. This was generally in evidence in or out of parliament and even when he enjoyed those wonderful red wines from his beloved Barossa Valley. However, I am reliably informed that there was just one occasion when, as a member of state parliament, these characteristics deserted him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One evening his colleagues took him to dinner for his birthday and perhaps an unusually large quantity of his beloved Barossa red was consumed. But, whatever the reason, after dinner Sir Condor gave a most uncharacteristic speech in which he was completely unrestrained and aggressive in his approach, the chamber ringing with what colleagues described as Churchillian tones. That this was regarded as such an out of character speech by Sir Condor simply reinforces his normally gentlemanly behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite his 1965 defeat, Sir Condor was not long out of parliament. In March 1967 he was preselected for the No. 1 spot on the South Australian Liberal Senate ticket for the Senate election due later that year. He entered the Senate early, in November 1967, following the death of Senator Hannaford. In the Senate he served this chamber, the people of South Australia and the Liberal Party well, bringing his wide counsel to many deliberations. He was a shadow minister from 1972 to 1975 and then, as I have said, in February 1976 he was elected to the high office of President of this Senate. He performed the duties of President with great distinction until retiring in June 1981, being scrupulously fair and polite but nevertheless firm in his deliberations from the chair. He was justifiably knighted KCMG in the new year's honours of 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during this period as a South Australian parliamentary colleague, albeit in different chambers, that I got to know Sir Condor even better. Whenever his advice was sought by a new young member it was freely and generously given. On several occasions after attending functions in the Barossa Valley I recall returning to his magnificent cellar, magnificent not just in the sense of what was stored there but as a magnificently furnished room in which he took great delight in extending his generous hospitality to friends. So it is no wonder that on the last Saturday night in June 1981 some 1,300 friends gathered in the enormous Tanunda show hall to pay tribute to Sir Condor on his retirement from the Senate. It was again a privilege to share the hospitality of his cellar late into the night after that function and to hear him recount his experiences over a long parliamentary career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even that was the not the end of his career. From 1982 he served a decade as Lieutenant-Governor of South Australia and, as in his other roles, he served this role with great distinction. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His funeral service in Bethlehem Lutheran church in Adelaide last Thursday week was a grand and fitting tribute to a remarkable man and a servant of his state. Throughout his career Sir Condor valued the love and support of his wife Rose and his children Rosemary and young Condor, and in more recent years of his grandchildren. In sharing the privilege of supporting this condolence motion with my colleagues, I especially send my sympathy to these members of his family whom I am also privileged to count as friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to be associated with the condolence motion for our former President of the Senate, Sir Condor Laucke. I entered the Senate following the election in December 1975. To put it mildly, it was not a particularly good year for Labor. There were only six new faces from my party that year, two in the House of Representatives and four in the Senate. Four of us virtually replaced other Labor members and the other two were Senate representatives from the territories which had representation in this chamber for the first time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention this because it helps to explain why the government of that time had a majority in its own right. In that respect, Senator Laucke as President was probably fortunate. I deliberately use the word `probably' because the government was in no mood to have its legislative program frustrated, and I have no doubt that from time to time Senator Laucke was leaned on by the government leader in the Senate. I do not for one minute imply that Senator Laucke responded to such tactics but it would not have made his task particularly easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My main memory of Senator Laucke is that he was a real gentleman. I still retain this memory even though he called me to order in my first speech which, of course, we used to call our maiden speech. Despite that rocky start I often consulted him on matters of procedure and, irrespective of the fact that I was from a different party, he was courteous and helpful whenever I sought his assistance. In those days there were some rough and ready characters in the opposition and it was not unusual for a senator to be suspended. Senator Laucke would almost bend over backwards to have the offending senator apologise rather than be suspended and, when suspension did follow, he actually became upset when he was required to order a senator from the chamber. I would like to mention that I was here when Sir Condor Laucke was elected President in 1976. I can assure Senator Chapman that the newspaper report to which he referred was totally incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often when we remember our former colleagues we remember humorous incidents in which they were involved. I would like to share just three such incidents with the Senate this afternoon. The first occurred when Senator Laucke presided over his first division. He seemed a little taken aback when a division was called for but quickly regained his composure to announce, `Division required, close the doors'. Of course, he corrected his error in order for the bells to be rung but it did seem to be a novel way of conducting a division. If senators were in the chamber well and good; if they were not, too bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second incident which I would like to share occurred when there was a joint sitting of the House of Representatives and the Senate to choose a senator to represent the Australian Capital Territory following the death of Senator John Knight. It is history, of course, that the Senate appointed Senator Reid. Senator Laucke presided and the proceedings were telecast&mdash;an unusual occurrence in those days. Senator Laucke conducted the proceedings using a forthright delivery to fit the occasion. When the proceedings had concluded, he announced to members of both houses and to the public watching on television, `I now declare this joint sitting open'. After a perceptible pause, he corrected with, `closed'. I suppose that in our role as senators we are asked to open so many activities that his error was understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third incident had the Senate in peals of laughter. The occasion was question time. Senator Walsh rose to ask a question. I would now like to quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but I am afraid the situation may not seem as humorous as it did in real life. Holding up a toilet roll, Senator Walsh asked:</PARA>

<PARA>he was holding the toilet roll up&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is clearly marked `Government of New South Wales'. In response to the Prime Minister's latest exhortation to reduce government expenditure, has the Government taken to pilfering parliamentary toilet paper from the State of New South Wales? If not, what is the explanation?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Withers, who was the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Administrative Services, replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that question should have been directed to you, Mr President, because I neither order nor pay for the toilet paper used in Parliament House. I suppose that one could say at the conclusion of the parliamentary session that Senator Walsh has come to the bottom of question time by asking that sort of question. I shall leave it to you, Mr President, to answer the question whether your officers are stealing the paper or purchasing it.</PARA>
<PARA>With the roll of toilet paper clearly visible on Senator Walsh's desk, the President replied:</PARA>

In 1965, when he lost his seat in state parliament, I remember my father coming home and saying, `Well, my boy, you haven't seen the last of Condor Laucke'.

<PARA>Dame Marie was born in 1902&mdash;91 years ago&mdash;at St Kilda, Victoria, and educated at St Michael's Church of England Girls Grammar School. She was elected to federal parliament in 1961, although did not take her seat in this chamber until mid-1962. Her time in this place was but a small part of a career dedicated to welfare work for women and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her life in the public arena began in 1941 when she became, for a short, time the Mayoress of Brighton. From 1954 until 1958 she was President of the National Council of Women and for her outstanding work with this organisation was awarded the Order of the British Empire. Dame Marie will be remembered for her efforts during that time in gaining government subsidies for child care facilities. That is something that may be taken for granted today, but in the 1950s Dame Marie was certainly breaking very new ground indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her maiden speech in this chamber reflected her great concern for the welfare of Australian families and left no doubt as to what she saw as her priorities: the standard of living of rural Australians, medical care for all Australians and the fight for the stability of family life. She was a member of numerous organisations such as: the Family Planning Association; the Victorian Family Council, of which she was President from 1958 to 1978; and, a little ahead of her time, the Australian-Asian Association of Victoria, of which she was also President from 1956 until 1974. These are but a handful of the organisations with which Dame Marie was involved in the course of her very long and very distinguished career. In 1979 she was made Dame of the British Empire for distinguished community service. On behalf of the government, I extend our sincere sympathy to her family in their bereavement. </PARA>

It is indeed rare for a life to be dedicated to community service to the extent that Marie Breen was. She was born and bred in Melbourne and I understand that she lived there all her life. In 1941, when Mayoress of Brighton, Mrs Breen, as she then was, began a 36-year involvement with the Victorian Baby Health Centres Association. She represented the Baby Health Centres Association on the National Council of Women. Her involvement with the National Council of Women expanded to becoming honorary international secretary from 1948 to 1953 and later President from 1954 to 1958.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1944 it was Mrs Breen's approach to the Victorian state health minister that led to an amendment to the Local Government Act enabling municipalities to employ home help assistance. While much of her work focused on the areas of women and children's health and welfare, Marie Breen was also champion of the importance of the family unit. Through her involvement with the mothers union of the Church of England from 1938, she came to be, from 1946 to 1960, convenor of the Church of England Marriage Guidance and Education Council. She helped to train the first marriage guidance counsellors and was herself a counsellor until she became a senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Breen also had a strong interest in fostering good relations between countries in our region. She was, as Senator Gareth Evans has just said, a major figure in the Australian-Asian Association of Victoria and, in fact, foundation Vice-President of the association from 1956 to 1973. Mrs Breen was one of the founders of the Victorian Family Council from which the Citizens Advice Bureau evolved. From 1967 to 1974 she was the foundation President of the Melbourne Citizens Advice Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her political involvement began as far back as 1936 when she became honorary secretary of the Brighton branch of the Australian Women's National League, a position which she held for four years.

From 1940 to 1945 Mrs Breen was President of the Brighton branch of the AWNL and a member of its executive committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her record of service to the Liberal Party is truly outstanding. Among offices too numerous to mention, she was for 15 years&mdash;from 1945 to 1960&mdash;chairman of the women's section of the LCP of Victoria, and from 1946 to 1961 she was a member of its executive committee. For two years in the early 1950s she was chairman of the federal executive of the Liberal Party. She was elected to the Senate in 1961, taking her place the following year. Her time in the Senate was distinguished by her involvement in a number of committees, including as Vice-Chairman and later Chairman of the Printing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the serious illness of her husband, as a result of an accident in 1968, led to her decision not to seek re-election in the election of that year. Her retirement from the Senate, however, was anything but idle. She continued to serve the community in a multitude of ways, which included a stint as President of the Family Planning Association of Victoria from 1970 to 1971 and membership of the Housing Builders Registry Board from 1972 to 1979. She was also a member of the Australian Advisory Council of Elders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Senator Breen's exceptional service to the community was recognised during her lifetime with the award of the OBE in 1958. She received the award of Dame of the British Empire in 1979. In an interview in 1989, Marie Breen mentioned that she had been privileged to meet many able women during her life and to learn from them. Her own life is undoubtedly one of those which will serve to inspire others. The people of Australia, particularly those of Melbourne, Victoria, have much for which to thank Marie Breen. On behalf of all coalition senators, I take this opportunity to extend our sincere condolences to her daughters and their family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie Breen was a Liberal senator for six years, from 1962 to 1968. It is a great source of pride for the Liberal Party that it was in the forefront of endorsing women for parliament. In the early 1960s there were five women in the federal parliament, four of whom represented the Liberal Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps inspired by Dame Marie Breen's magnificent community record, the Victorian Liberal Party approached her to stand for the Senate in 1961.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was not any wild desire to have women in parliament amongst the male population. It is better now, but it was not very much to the fore in those days.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that Dame Marie Breen was a remarkable woman with great strength of character. From my conversations with those who knew her, a picture has emerged of a person with very strong personal values, and particularly the great Christian values of family, public service and community. In many ways, her life, which was dedicated to building and strengthening voluntary organisations, embodied one of the great traditions of the Liberal Party. I refer to the commitment to voluntary work as the basis for building a strong community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is delivering in another place his budget speech for 1993-94. It is my privilege to outline to the Senate the budget proposals of the government. Mr President, the greatest issue facing our nation is how to provide jobs for our fellow Australians. Too many are now out of work; too many have been out of work for too long. The primary objective of this budget is jobs&mdash;jobs in the short term by providing a further stimulus to the economy this year to sustain Australia's economic growth until the motor of the world recovery kicks in, and jobs in the medium and longer term by boosting the capacity of Australian business to expand production on a world competitive basis. This is a budget to strengthen the recovery and make it sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has had a number of economic recoveries in the post-war period only to see them taper off prematurely, but this recovery is different. It is different because firmly embedded into Australia's economic structure we now have two vital ingredients&mdash;inflation at levels lower than seen for 30 years and interest rates at their lowest in 20 years. These have been the twin goals of every government for a quarter of a century, but it is this government which has attained them, and harnessed them for the future benefit of all Australians. That makes this recovery different. This will be a quality recovery&mdash;a durable recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this budget establishes an economic framework over four years; a framework for continuing low interest rates and continuing low inflation which, combined with reduced company tax and generous investment incentives, will support increased business investment for future growth in production and employment. This budget sets us on a prudent path leading to lower government deficits and higher national saving. This budget proposes measures which, overall, will cut the deficit four years from now by $9 billion. These steps will see the public sector directly contribute some $17 billion to the improvement of national saving over the three years to 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget also takes action on government programs put forward in the context of the last election. Well over 100 separate spending commitments will be implemented. These will be funded over the course of the next four years. These commitments give effect to the government's plans to provide extra help to families with children, extra assistance to those out of work, improved health services and other initiatives to make this society even fairer and more cohesive.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other commitments include action to enrich the culture of our country, protect its environment and support those living outside the major cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget will also provide new support for our emerging exporters, who are demonstrating such remarkable success in capturing new markets for products made and developed by the skilled hands and creative minds of Australia's working men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget also provides relief for middle Australia by lowering marginal tax rates for those on incomes between $20,700 and $50,000. This will reduce the tax paid by a person on $600 per week by $8 per week. Not only will this promised tax cut be delivered, but also it will be delivered eight months early, commencing on 1 November 1993&mdash;just eleven weeks away. This early payment is largely made possible by higher dividends from businesses like Telecom and the Reserve Bank. It is only right that taxpayers should benefit from the higher earnings of these public bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to go further with the tax cuts by extending the benefits to low income taxpayers. Those on incomes below $23,200 will receive a new rebate paid on assessment. This will relieve about 90,000 taxpayers of their entire tax bill and ensure that a tax cut of $100 or more is paid to all other taxpayers annually. The combined effects of the budget measures will result in a deficit of $16 billion this year. This will provide an extra stimulus of around $2 billion to Australia's economy at a time when a stimulus is needed to sustain the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Economic Context</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's subdued recovery in part reflects the time taken to recover from the sapping effects of the debt build-up and falling asset prices of the late 1980s. Of more importance, though, is the continuing weakness of the world economy. Whereas a year ago growth in the industrialised economies was expected to be three per cent in 1993, it is now expected to be only a little over one per cent. Japan and Germany, the world's second and third largest economies, have yet to emerge from recession. Against that background Australia has done well and will continue to do so. Our GDP growth in 1992-93 was 2 1/2 per cent&mdash;a rate the envy of the industrialised world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our relatively good performance can be attributed to two factors. First, the government's foresight in building up budget surpluses in the late 1980s, and then using that capacity to provide a major stimulus to the economy when it was required; and second, our growing trade and investment links with the fastest growing region of the world&mdash;the dynamic economies of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the short-term outlook for the world economy remains subdued and, therefore, places a constraint on our own growth. The world outlook, however, is expected to improve during 1994. Australia's challenge is to position itself to take full advantage of stronger world growth as it comes on stream and to continue our integration with the Asian economies. Above all, this requires the further development of world class industries able to seek out and exploit new opportunities. That assures the best long-term prospect of reducing unemployment and raising Australian living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Policy will have its part to play by building on the substantial structural reform achieved over the past ten years; by maintaining the much improved competitive position of our export industries&mdash;especially through low inflation; and by adjusting fiscal policy so that sufficient domestic saving is available to fund the additional investment required. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Budget Strategy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, at the July Premiers' Conference all Australian governments agreed on the key challenge for fiscal policy today. The conference benefited from a major report on national saving commissioned from Dr Vince FitzGerald, a response to which the Treasurer is releasing tonight. That fiscal challenge is to continue the stimulus to activity over the next year to encourage economic recovery and job growth, while setting in train medium term adjustments to significantly increase public sector saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From next financial year, the process of withdrawing the stimulus and cutting the deficit will begin. While the growth path of the economy will assist, on its own it will be insufficient to accomplish the task. This budget therefore contains measures which will accelerate the process. Four years from now, the deficit will be cut to less than $6 billion, or around one per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This meets a key election commitment of the government. It will be achieved through five complementary steps. First, the second round of tax cuts will be deferred from 1996 until a time when fiscal conditions permit, probably in 1998. Second, outlays will be reduced by $2 billion. Third, the income tax system will be tightened to remove or reduce certain concessions, and to tax non-cash benefits in a manner more equivalent to the taxation of the ordinary income of wage and salary earners. This will raise over $600 million. Fourth, rates of excise on petroleum products and tobacco will be progressively increased. Fifth, wholesale sales tax rates will be increased in two stages over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these outlays and revenue measures will reduce the prospective deficit for 1996-97 by $9 billion, but these changes will do more than that. They will halt the erosion of Commonwealth indirect tax revenues, thus preventing Australia's tax system becoming lopsided. The share of tax revenue, other than from income tax, has fallen by almost a third&mdash;from 8.3 per cent of GDP in the mid-eighties to 5.9 per cent last year. Failure to act on the indirect tax side would create pressures for more weight on income tax, a weight which would fall most heavily on middle income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will meet its announced objectives without the introduction of a massive new indirect tax. The government will maintain indirect tax exemptions for the necessities of life. The government will maintain the system of higher tax rates for luxury items such as fur coats, jewellery and expensive cars. Compared with the taxation situation applying last financial year, the benefits flowing from the income tax cuts plus the new rebate amount to $1.7 billion this financial year, rising to $3.8 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indirect tax increases raise $1.3 billion this financial year, rising to $3.0 billion. In other words, in each year the benefits from the tax cuts will greatly exceed the extra indirect tax revenue&mdash;with these benefits being delivered to middle Australia. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the main aspects of the measures, full details of which are provided in supporting documents. Excise on petroleum products will rise by 3c a litre from tonight and a further 2c a litre a year later. An additional increase on leaded petrol will commence in February 1994 at 1c per litre rising to 5c per litre by a year later. This recognises the harmful effect of lead in petrol, particularly on the children of Australia, and will accelerate the conversion of the motor vehicle fleet to unleaded petrol.

The safety net for the PBS will be tightened for non-card holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further savings will come from restricting access to Medicare benefits for optometry services.

But this will be gradually introduced over 20 years&mdash;minimising the impact on those approaching retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned that some families of fairly comfortable means have been able to exploit negative gearing to meet income test rules.

The implementation of the remaining few is still being resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with some of the major commitments briefly. The new Commonwealth dental health program will provide all health card holders with improved access to emergency care from January 1994&mdash;and basic dental care from six months later. The new child-care cash rebate of 30 per cent of claimable costs will be introduced from July next year, to be paid to eligible families regardless of income. A total of 230,000 Australian families will benefit from this measure, with payments of up to $28.20 per week for one child, and $61.20 for two or more children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new home child care allowance will be paid from September next year. It will provide payments of up to $30 per week and will replace the dependent spouse rebate for couples with children; 840,000 Australian families will benefit. This is a substantial and progressive change to Australia's income support system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new seniors health card will be provided, from 1 July next year, to low income retirees not currently receiving the pension. This will entitle around 200,000 older Australians to benefits which include concessional pharmaceuticals and hearing aids, and access to the new dental health program. The pension assets test will be eased with effect from September this year. This will benefit around 60,000 non-pensioner and part-pensioner retirees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this budget also contains a number of initiatives additional to those raised in the election context. The government said in the election that it would not forget the unemployed, nor leave them behind. To address this problem more fully, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has established a committee on employment opportunities, comprising recognised experts in this area. The committee is examining current policies on unemployment, and possible alternatives, and will prepare a discussion paper by December this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will form the basis for broad community debate, leading to a government white paper on the issue. This will provide the forum for consideration of any new approaches for dealing with this very real social and economic problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But for now this budget will provide increased support for Australia's unemployed in two substantial ways. First, the total number of labour market program places available in this financial year will be increased to over 500,000. Two-thirds of these are for people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. Second, we will increase by $6 per fortnight the rate of newstart allowance paid to single adults without children, unemployed for more than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Investment and Trade</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One sure way to reduce unemployment is through the expansion and development of Australian industry. That requires business investment. And to secure that business investment, Australian governments need to create the most favourable environment for the expansion of productive business and jobs. Creating that environment requires the establishment of a stable framework for business planning. Crucial to that, there must be confidence that Australia's prospective budget deficit is being reduced substantially over the medium term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, this government is actively promoting Australia's economic transition through its taxation policy. Action has already been taken to implement a number of election commitments in this area. Central to these was the reduction in the company tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, effective from 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given investment an additional fillip by introducing a general investment allowance and have expanded the development allowance. This budget goes further by providing a boost to exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere is Australia's economic transition more evident than in our trading performance. Exports now account for 20 per cent of the total goods and services we produce, compared with 13 per cent a decade ago. The composition of our trade has changed and matured. Exports of the more sophisticated manufactured goods have grown at 20 per cent annually over the last seven years. The destination of Australia's exports has also shifted dramatically, with Asia now taking almost 60 per cent of our merchandise exports. This partly reflects the much higher growth rates in Asia than in the older industrialised world. It also reflects our developing trade successes in the region. We must build on the progress to date and encourage greater engagement with the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One initiative the Treasurer is announcing tonight is the establishment of a committee jointly with the Northern Territory Government to consider strategies to develop the potential of Darwin as Australia's northern link to east Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">McKinsey's recent study of emerging exporters revealed that much of the impetus for our recent export growth has come from 700 small to medium sized manufacturing exporters. These exporters earned over $8 billion in 1990-91, double the level of four years earlier. According to that study, 90 per cent of Australia's manufacturers&mdash;more than 6000 businesses&mdash;are not yet exporting, but most could be, suggesting an undeveloped source of potential exports and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge is to see many more of these companies achieve their potential. Accordingly, $94 million will be provided over the next three years to fund a package of measures designed to encourage more small to medium sized firms to commence exporting and to intensify the efforts of existing exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures include the establishment of first stop shops, improvements to the export market development grants scheme, and the establishment of a `Market Australia' campaign.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other Policy Settings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, other policy settings are also crucial to boosting Australia's competitive position. Wages policy is making its contribution by supporting a more decentralised and flexible system to secure faster productivity growth. Workplace bargaining is becoming the centrepiece of the system, with now over 1,000 federally registered enterprise agreements. Work practices can now be better attuned to the needs of individual firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such changes could not have been achieved without the support and commitment of Australia's trade union movement. The Government's accord with the ACTU will maintain the framework for reform, and increase the focus on workplace bargaining. The Government will protect vulnerable workers with legislation to guarantee minimum wages and conditions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also support an arbitrated safety net adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, continued and accelerated structural reform is critical to increasing growth in the economy and expanding job opportunities. We have carried out extensive reforms in the past decade. Some of the payoffs are already evident and include lower domestic air fares, lower phone charges, greater labour productivity in shipping and on our railways, and better ship cargo handling rates and turnaround times.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such reforms improve Australia's prospects in an increasingly competitive world. This process will be taken further when the government considers the report of the national competition policy review, which we expect to receive in the next few days. I expect the recommendations of that review will lead to improvements in the regulatory environment for business, and further efficiency gains. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Economic Prospects/Conclusions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, the budget presented tonight marks the commencement of a new era in Australian public finance. It is the first Commonwealth budget crafted within the framework of a national fiscal strategy&mdash;with its figuring informed by July's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Fiscal Outlook</EMPHASIS> report. It will be the last Commonwealth budget to be brought down in August. From next year, the budget will be delivered before the end of June. That will allow decision makers to plan for a full financial year, fully informed of the details of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight's budget is designed to fortify the framework of Australia's economic growth. In the short term, it provides a continuing stimulus while the economy is still being buffeted by weak international growth.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these headwinds, growth is expected to be a little stronger in the year ahead, and at a rate few other industrialised countries will exceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth this year will be aided by continuing steady growth in private consumption, stronger public sector demand and a contribution from net exports. Business investment is expected to improve. This augurs well for the future. It will help the recovery to gain momentum. Employment growth will begin to recover, but not fast enough to make major inroads into unemployment this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Mr President, this budget is not just about this year. It is part of a longer-term strategy&mdash;a strategy to build the savings of the nation as the economy recovers, so that private investment can be financed, and more of it financed at home; a strategy that builds on and complements the impressive progress already made in improving our economic strengths. Over the next four years, the economic transition we embarked upon ten years ago will be taken further: the transition from being inward looking and highly protected, to a modern world-class economy; the transition from excessive reliance on ties with Europe, to participating in the opportunities provided by the economic dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No longer is Australia a European outpost on the far side of the world; we have seen the tyranny of distance give way to the blessing of proximity. We have redirected our trade focus and diversified our export base. We are 30 per cent more competitive than we were ten years ago.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity has grown by five per cent over the last two years. The profit share has recovered to the high levels of the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But beyond all else, the two most historically important achievements are those on inflation and interest rates. It is 30 years since inflation has been so low, and monetary policy will play its part in keeping core inflation low. It is 20 years since interest rates have been so low. These are achievements to be proud of. They are the vital building blocks for better investment and export performance. They result from a coordinated and coherent strategy of reform across all sectors of the economy. In the 1980s, Australia led the developed world in structural reform, and we are staying the course in the 1990s so as to maximise the benefits of the reforms to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, this budget details a coherent and carefully designed plan for achieving the government's announced fiscal objective of reducing the deficit over four years. It continues the government's strong record of fiscal responsibility established in the 1980s while delivering on election commitments. And it does so by keeping Australia a low tax country and at the same time delivering substantial income tax cuts. Next month, Australia will be confirmed by the OECD as the country with the lowest level of taxation in the industrialised world. The decisions announced tonight are designed to keep Australia in the low tax league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, tonight's budget reinforces the strengths on which Australia's long-term prosperity depends. It provides a prudent path to the future: a path leading to an Australia which saves more; a path leading to an Australia which can invest more in its own undoubted strengths; and a path leading crucially to more jobs for our people. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was active in the Victorian Baby Health Centres Association and was an executive member for 36 years. She became convenor of the Mothers Union and was integral in the establishment of, and became Vice-President of, the Marriage Guidance Council of Victoria.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans, in his condolence speech, pointed out that, in the area of child-care, for example, Dame Marie Breen could rightly be described as a pathfinder in promoting that particular area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the aegis of the National Council for Women, she was instrumental in the establishment of the citizens advice bureaus and strongly supported the establishment of an institute of family studies. Dame Marie's enormous efforts in welfare work for women and children were officially recognised when she was awarded an OBE in 1958 and in 1979 when she was made Dame of the British Empire, or DBE. Dame Marie held a wide range of offices in the Liberal Party and was a member of the executive committee and chairman of the women's section. She was state vice-president from 1955 to 1961. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Liberal Party senator from 1962, she continued to promote her firm belief in the central and stabilising role of the family.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In her public speeches, Senator Breen placed considerable emphasis on the importance of family life, stating on one occasion that `stable national life depended very largely upon a stable family life'. However, she did not see that as excluding other areas of political debate, rather, that all topics had an effect on family life and that therefore women had an important role to play.</PARA>
<PARA>Although she had been long involved in public affairs, Dame Marie recounts her terror at having to present her maiden speech and the prospect of every word being recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her friends have reminded me in so many ways that Dame Marie could be described as a pathfinder. A number of other senators have mentioned that she was a very strong advocate of closer relations with our Asian neighbours.

There seems little doubt that had Marie Breen stayed in the Senate she would have risen to high political office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other features of this remarkable woman which should be recorded in the Senate this evening. Marie Breen was a committed and practising Christian all her life. Her faith was reflected in her longstanding record of service to the church. The Friday night discussion group meetings, for example, which she organised for the St Peter's youth fellowship in the 1940s and 1950s where topical and contentious issues were discussed are still, I am pleased to record, remembered by those who attended those particular discussion groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marie Breen was a very talented pianist and singer and at one stage in her youth she hoped to pursue a musical career and study at the conservatorium. However, her mother convinced her that she should instead learn more practical skills, such as secretarial skills, so that she could help her brother in his legal practice. While Marie Breen did as her mother wished, her artistic gifts and interests were not wasted. Dame Marie, together with her daughter Jeannette, sang with the Brighton philharmonic choir and even had a season in the chorus of the National Opera. Her interest in opera and ballet continued throughout her life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie also had a prodigious memory.

Honourable senators will recall that this election was a very narrow squeak for the then Menzies government. It was a very important time to be coming into politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie retired at the end of her one six-year term to care for her husband, who had been severely injured some time earlier in an horrific accident. Very sadly, he died shortly after her retirement from the Senate. As Senator Kemp and others have mentioned, she was a very devoted carer for her husband during that very sad time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not know Marie Breen closely. Indeed, I had not seen her for many years. However, I did have the privilege of knowing her a little during her term in the Senate. For almost two years of that period, I worked in the old Parliament House as the private secretary for the late Harold Holt and, subsequently, William McMahon. I recall that she was held in very high regard by her parliamentary colleagues and, very significantly, by those on both sides of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie had a very wide range of interests and experiences. She achieved a great deal at a time when it was extremely difficult for women to have access to public office. She was very heavily involved as an office-bearer in many family related and people related organisations&mdash;the Citizens Advice Bureau, the Church of England Marriage Guidance and Education Council, the Victorian baby health centres association and the Family Planning Association, to name but some of the more significant ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was one of those Australians who took an early interest in developing Australia's relations with Asia. The current Prime Minister, Mr Keating, is busy attempting to rewrite history, implying that it has been only under his prime ministership and in recent years that Australia has discovered the significance of Asia. That, of course, is nonsense and people such as Marie Breen are a striking testimony to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dame Marie was a member of the Australian Asia Association of Victoria for almost 20 years from as far back as 1956. She was Vice-President for most of that time. Indeed, she was chairman of the association's women's group from 1957 until she entered the Senate in 1962. Her chairmanship of that association's women's group was but part of her wider involvement with women's issues and movements. In particular, she was also President of the National Council of Women from 1954 to 1958. It was particularly her welfare work for women and children which led to her being honoured with the award of OBE in 1958 and, later in 1979, she was made a Dame of the British Empire, or DBE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this work for women and children, Dame Marie epitomised the true spirit of voluntarism. In an interview she gave just two or three years ago, she said, `It typifies the caring for each other that people need to express'. Much of this sort of spirit has been lost in the Australian community. Remembrance of Marie Breen is an important reminder to us of the significance of that spirit and activity of voluntarism. </PARA>

I join with other senators in extending my sympathy to her remaining family&mdash;her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I hope that their undoubted cherished memories of Marie Breen and her very significant achievements will provide comfort for them at this time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Friday 2 July 1993, of Sir (Ernest) Edward `Weary' Dunlop, AC  CMG  OBE, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>In recent weeks all Australians have mourned the loss of Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. He was 85. Through his work as a surgeon in prisoner of war camps in Asia during the Second World War and his postwar work assisting veterans, Weary Dunlop, as he was universally known, was a figure not just honoured and revered but genuinely loved by his fellow Australians. I certainly feel privileged to have met and talked with him on several occasions over the past few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was born into a farming family in northern Victoria in 1907. After an active and purportedly happy childhood, he gained qualifications in both pharmacy and medicine. His student days in Melbourne were full to the brim, as he was also a brilliant sportsman and became a champion at boxing and rugby union. He was in London undertaking postgraduate work in surgery when the war began. He loved his work, but the outbreak of war made life at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington seem like, as he said, a `charmed circle'. By pulling some strings, he managed to enlist in the 2nd AIF from London, and was posted directly to Jerusalem in November 1939 with the rank of captain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During his two years in the Middle East his appetite for adventure meant that he was rarely far from the centre of action. He served in Libya, Greece and Crete, and volunteered for service with the 2/2 Australian Casualty Clearing Station in besieged Tobruk. He declined command of that unit, preferring to retain the surgical post of major. On his way back to Australia with the 7th Division, his ship was diverted to Java in a desperate bid to stem the Japanese move southward. He was taken prisoner of war in February 1942. He was moved to Batavia, Singapore, and finally to Konyu camp, along the route of the now notorious Burma-Thailand railway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At Konyu and at further camps along the line, Dunlop and his fellow prisoners faced some of the most appalling conditions ever experienced by Australians at war. Men were daily forced out to work, clearing the jungle to make way for the railway. Malaria, dysentery, tropical ulcers, cholera and beri-beri were all common, exacerbated by malnutrition and brutal punishment by Japanese and Korean guards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again Dunlop intervened to stop desperately sick men being forced to work. He fashioned surgical instruments and equipment out of whatever was at hand and operated on his patients by oil light. He used all his wiles to obtain food and drugs. He saw his men out in the morning and was there to greet them when they arrived back exhausted at night. He was often sick himself and was punished and three times threatened with execution for his intercessions on behalf of the sick. Although forbidden to do so, he kept a radio and a detailed diary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His experience as a prisoner fostered in him insights into humanity that shaped the rest of his life. In his diary he allowed himself only snatches of despair and ill-feeling towards the Japanese. In May 1943 he admitted to a `searing hate' arising in him whenever he saw a Japanese. He was as capable of hatred as he was of love, but ultimately he could not suppress a deep compassion from developing for the Japanese when he understood the wretchedness of their position by the end of the war. At the end of his war diary he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been a war against monstrous things, but one for which we all share responsibility because of the selfish pre-occupations which allowed matters to reach such hideous proportions.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Edward resolved then to make the welfare of ex-prisoners of war a life-long mission. In the postwar years, as he rose to prominence as a surgeon in Melbourne, he was tireless in the service of his former comrades, once again intervening on their behalf whenever he could. Remarkably, he lacked any sense of bitterness or desire for recrimination against the Japanese. Instead, he set about promoting links between Australia and Asia, and with Japan in particular. He was active in the health programs sponsored under the Colombo Plan, initiated by Australia in 1950 to promote cooperation with and assistance to South East Asia. In 1969 he led an Australian medical team into South Vietnam to provide care for civilians injured in the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honours were heaped upon him in Australia and overseas, particularly in Thailand and Sri Lanka. He was made a knight bachelor in 1969, Australian of the Year in 1976 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in 1987. Through it all he remained essentially a very humble man and, like many ex-service people, not very comfortable in talking about his wartime experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the tributes that have been paid to him since his death, so many people have remembered his unfailing ability to see some good in everyone, including his enemies. It was that ability that drove his courage, his sense of duty and his capacity to forgive. With his great love and understanding of humanity, Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop will be very sadly missed. On behalf of the government, I extend our sincere sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate the opposition with this condolence motion for Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. In July we saw the death of quite a remarkable Australian; one of the great Australians of our lifetime. He was born in Victoria 85 years ago of Scottish extraction and through his life he exhibited all the great virtues of his forebears.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became a pharmacist and rapidly moved on to study medicine at the University of Melbourne, where he graduated with first class honours in 1934. He was not only a brilliant scholar, as Senator Evans has said, but he was also a brilliant sportsman. As well as being the heavyweight boxing champion for the University of Melbourne, he represented Australia playing rugby union with the Wallabies against the old enemy, the All Blacks. It is not unusual to find people in medicine who have a brilliant scholastic career and are brilliant at rugby as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After graduation he travelled to the United Kingdom because he wanted to be a specialist surgeon. He enrolled at St Bartholomew's Hospital, in London. Within 10 weeks he was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. To be admitted as a fellow today would take something like seven years. It is just a measure of how times have changed that the period taken at that time was so short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After becoming a specialist surgeon he taught at the British postgraduate medical school at Hammersmith and was appointed as a specialist surgeon at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington. I do not suppose that that collection of Victorian red brick buildings in Praed Street today is any different in appearance from what it was when he was appointed to the staff there in the late 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was with some very distinguished company there, including the head of the surgical unit, Arthur Porritt, who was a New Zealander. He was a sprinter in the Olympic Games in 1928, and later became Sir Arthur Porritt. He was President of the Royal College of Surgeons when I was living in England and knew him. He later became Governor-General of New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most famous person there at the time was Alexander Fleming, who discovered the bacteriocidal effects of penicillin. Through the war years the pharmacological application of this discovery was developed by Sir Howard Florey, from Adelaide, and the world gained one of its greatest chemotherapeutic agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outbreak of the war found Sir Edward wanting to enlist in the 2nd AIF. In his autobiography he said that he had some delay before he could enlist because there were no facilities for him to enlist from London. Nevertheless his service number was VX259. So the delay must have been measured in hours or at most one or two days; it certainly it did not run to many months. When people enlisted in the 2nd AIF they were given a number serially for each state&mdash;V was for Victoria and Q was for Queensland. His number of VX259 meant that he would have been the 259th person who enlisted from Victoria. There would not have been too much of a time delay there in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps before he went to England. It was as a medical officer that he joined the 2nd AIF at Palestine in the Middle East. He served in the ill-fated campaigns in Greece and Crete and was in Tobruk. He sailed with the first Australian corps to, firstly, Sumatra and then to Java. It was in Java in 1942 that he was captured and he spent the rest of the war as a POW. He started off as a captain and at the time of capture he was a lieutenant-colonel. He was promoted to colonel but he refused to accept the rank at the time because it meant that he would have been separated from his troops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That led to the legendary part of his career. He was a senior army officer and as such he was not only medical officer to the prisoners but also a camp commandant. After the war he pursued his surgical career with great success not only in Victoria but in Australia. His postwar career was marked by an involvement to the full in public affairs; he did what he could for the community in whatever ways were open to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was very active in promoting international relations, particularly with Asian countries and the South East Asian region. There has been quite a degree of distortion about our history promulgated in recent years, that somehow or other Australian interest in Asia goes back only two or three years. Nothing could be further from the truth. Dick Casey and Spender developed the Colombo Plan under the Menzies prime ministership. We heard on an earlier condolence motion the involvement of Dame Marie Breen in this. Right from the early part of the Colombo Plan and the Australian involvement in Asia, Sir Edward Dunlop was doing what he could visiting those countries, teaching and developing good relations with the regional states in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His principal concern was the welfare of the veterans, the ex-POWs in particular, who served with him in prison camps. In his treatment of and concern for the welfare of those people he demonstrated that great compassion and that ability to look forward, to not carry a grudge and to avoid the corrosive effects of hate in his life. He bore no enmity at all for his previous captors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to dwell for a moment on his time as a prisoner of war because, as I said, he was not only a medical officer looking after prisoners; he was also the commandant of a camp. He worked tirelessly, although he was sick and malnourished himself, and with great courage looking after the men under his command. One of the characteristics of the incarceration of the Australians and all the allied prisoners who suffered under the Japanese was that they were subject to brutal attacks by their guards. One of the procedures adopted by those of senior rank, whether corporals, sergeants or officers, was that when the privates were being bashed by the guards&mdash;as they frequently were&mdash;the person of superior rank would stand in and take the bashing for them. Weary Dunlop did this on innumerable occasions as a colonel. It is also a matter of record that, on several occasions, he was sentenced to death by the Japanese and his execution was stayed only at the last moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The camp of which he was the commanding officer was characterised by having one of the lowest death rates of all the large camps in Thailand. Dunlop himself explained that that was not because of the medical skill that he and the other medical officers in the camp possessed and delivered to the troops under their command. He explained it on the basis of leadership and he did that in a very self-effacing way. It was true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leadership today is a very undervalued commodity in contemporary Australian society. It is not absent from society but it is relatively rare; it is relatively scarce. What we have in this country today is a collection of what could best be described as managers, not leaders, in so many levels of human activity. They are worried about getting things done without a fuss and they are worried about the bottom line. There is not the respect nor the reward for leadership that there should be in this country. There is very little understanding of its value. Those attributes of leadership&mdash;dedication; energy; knowledge of what needs to be done; devotion to the cause; ability to comfort and cosset those they are leading; ability to inspire those they are leading to rise to achievements that they would not normally attain; selflessness; preferment of the interests of those they lead before their own, even to the extent of laying their own lives on the line&mdash;are the qualities that Weary Dunlop had in abundance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those qualities today, of course, are in contrast to the teaching of contemporary sociologists. They do not fit in in a country where human relations are run under the aegis of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission because it sees leadership as being elitist and authoritarian. Leadership, as Dunlop demonstrated, does not diminish anyone's human rights in any way at all; in fact, it enriches them. It is an essential attribute for a country to possess. It should be evident at all levels in society. Society is not great because of a prime minister or a president. A society is great because the community works together for common goals and because it stays together in small, cohesive units, all led by someone who is a leader of that small group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great achievements of the Australian Defence Force turn on the leadership that it has possessed over the years. Maybe we have paid too high a price in the wars we have been involved in, principally the First World War and the Second World War where we had very high casualty rates, where so many leaders were killed&mdash;both officers and NCOs. Those with superior rank in the Australian Defence Force always led by example, whether they were corporals or colonels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our army history is replete with examples where company commanders were killed and platoon commanders took over the company; where platoon commanders were killed and sergeants or corporals took over; where section commanders were killed and privates led the section. I hope that as a nation we can draw inspiration from Dunlop's life and the leadership that he showed his fellow Australians&mdash;he was the personification of great leadership attributes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was surprised at the public response to Weary Dunlop's death. I had the privilege of meeting him on only one occasion some years ago and had a long talk with him. I read his book when it was published and I have read a large number of articles about him. But the response of the Australian community was absolutely unrehearsed. It was a natural and an overwhelming expression of admiration for this man and his life. It was not developed in any way at all by any special interest groups, least of all by the government, and yet the media were totally dominated by his death for days afterwards. Those of us who were in St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne for that huge funeral service will never forget the tangible expression from ordinary Australians&mdash;the expression of respect for, and admiration of, his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw a great deal of comfort from the public response to Weary Dunlop's death. It was the voice of the silent majority of Australia&mdash;the silent majority which is normally never heard. People were moved out of respect for this man and the work of his life. I hope it is a sign that this country is growing up and maturing, that the buccaneers of the stock exchange or the commercial world and the Ned Kellys are no longer taken as the heroes of this country, and that this country recognises real worth in human character. If we all keep the example of his life before us, I am sure that this country will be a much better place for it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Edward's surgical skills saved hundreds of lives; his personal courage saved countless more.

Senator Evans and others referred to his work in education, in forging links and exchanging skills and culture with Asian nations. Many richly deserved national and international honours have been bestowed on Sir Edward over the years. Despite all these commitments and his patronage of, or participation in, some 40 organisations, he was not diverted from that resolution to make the care and welfare of his fellow prisoners of war a lifelong mission. An article in the news bulletin of the Ex-Prisoners of War and Relatives Association published in July, after his death, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Weary's determination to fulfil that promise to his P.O.W. mates had not diminished in interest, nor wanted in its sincerity in all that time. No ex-P.O.W. or widow was ever turned away, and there would be thousands today who would testify to that and agree that their present position physically and financially is due to the sincere interest displayed in their cause by "Weary".</PARA>
<PARA>My department has been assisted in its charter over the years by having the advocacy of Sir Edward Dunlop on behalf of veterans. He willingly participated in many joint committees of veterans organisations and the department, as well as making representations on behalf of many in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I had the opportunity to work with him for only a few months. However, it gives me a great deal of personal satisfaction that I met him at my first formal meeting with the officials of the major ex-service organisations in Victoria only a month before he died. I will certainly remember that occasion. In a room of very prominent Australians, Weary Dunlop exuded the presence that speaks of a very great man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His association with my department will live on through the Sir Edward Dunlop Medical Research Foundation. In his later years Sir Edward made representations based on his view that insufficient medical research had been devoted to the needs of ageing veterans; research which, in his vision, would subsequently benefit the ageing population in our community at large. His vision was taken up with my department by the Veterans Affairs Coordinating Council of Organisations in Victoria. This resulted in the incorporation of the Sir Edward Dunlop Medical Research Foundation as a public company in May 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work to establish the foundation, which has a national role in funding research, was a joint venture between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the ex-service organisations in Victoria. Although the foundation operates independently of the department, I would point out that accommodation and administrative support are provided by the department in furthering the foundation's work. The main aim of the foundation, endorsed by Sir Edward, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To do and undertake all things necessary for, or tending toward or likely to promote, the maintenance and improvement of the medical and similar care of veterans and their dependants, their health and general welfare.</PARA>
<PARA>In accepting the request to be patron of the foundation, Sir Edward wrote on 6 June 1985:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel very honoured indeed that you should seek permission to name the foundation "The Sir Edward Dunlop Medical Research Foundation". Whilst feeling in no way worthy of this signalisation, I am of course very anxious to be associated with any measures which will add something to the care of veterans.</PARA>
<PARA>Like everything else that he did in his life, Sir Edward followed through. He was a very active patron and frequently attended meetings of the board of directors to advise, to suggest and to support. In fact, he attended a meeting of the board only one week before his death. While he would personally seek no overt recognition, I am sure there can be no more fitting and lasting memorial to Sir Edward Dunlop than a medical research foundation bearing his name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Edward's memory will live on in the minds and hearts of many Australians who have been touched in some way by his life's work. The Department of Veterans' Affairs will be proud to play its part by continuing to provide the support the foundation needs to carry on the work that he resolved would be his lifelong mission. We have lost a truly great Australian in Weary Dunlop. I join other honourable senators in extending my deepest sympathy to his family and friends. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join the condolence motion moved by Senator Evans and supported by other colleagues in the Senate. Every nation has its heroes, but few have one of the calibre of Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. As someone said, there might be some that were equal but none better. His approach to the deprivation that was the lot of prisoners of war throughout South-East Asia in World War II was typical of his whole approach to life itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weary Dunlop was a man of great dedication. I saw a little of this when, as a Queenslander who had moved to Melbourne, I was a student at Melbourne University where Weary Dunlop himself had studied medicine and acquired his questionable nickname. Honourable senators will probably be aware that nicknames in years gone by were a common practice and the name developed from Dunlop Tyres, hence Weary Dunlop. </PARA>
<PARA>I might say, having known the man, that somehow either the man fitted the nickname or the nickname fitted the man; I am not too sure. It is to his honour that the ethics and standards he set for his fellow men have now made that rather nonsensical whimsical nickname a very revered title in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Weary, I also played rugby union at Melbourne University although, unlike him, I never made it as an Australian representative against the New Zealand All Blacks. But as patron of the Melbourne University rugby union club, Weary Dunlop made it a practice to attend a match every Saturday. While he was marching up and down the sidelines in the wet winters of Melbourne, in that dreary drizzle&mdash;I can say that now, having gone back to Queensland&mdash;we could hear the thundering crowds at the MCG attending that other game. But there would be the tall, lanky figure of Weary Dunlop cheering on the Melbourne University side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, he was there on a day when I was injured. When I came off the field with what looked like a pretty serious injury he looked at me and said, `I'm going to have to take you to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, give you an anaesthetic and fix that up. But, meanwhile, stay with me and watch the end of the game'. So Weary and I plodded up and down the sidelines for about another 35 minutes and he then took me off to the Royal Melbourne Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember it well because when I arrived a female anaesthetist&mdash;this is not a sexist comment in any way&mdash;said to me, `When did you last have a meal?'. I have forgotten the exact answer that I gave, but she said, `Sorry, Dr Dunlop, you can't operate for another two hours'. To a man who had been on the Burma railway, using jam tin lids to amputate limbs with or without anaesthetic, this was a bit rich. I can remember his saying to this anaesthetist, `Doctor, every time you give an anaesthetic it is a crisis in your life. Give him the pentothal now'. So they put me straight onto the anaesthetic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, he asked me to come to his home where he could check his work to see whether it had been successful. I can remember spending a very pleasant afternoon with him and his wife, Helen, in their Toorak Road house in Melbourne. In fact, it was there that I learnt that his wife had come from the city of Toowoomba in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one of those people who had the rare privilege of crossing the path of one such as Weary Dunlop. So it was a pleasure for me that I was able to renew his acquaintance right here in 1988 at the opening of the new Parliament House. I think it was fitting that a man of such distinction should have been present at such an event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended the opening of the new Parliament House with my three sons and of course, as everyone would know, there were a lot of very prominent figures promenading in the Great Hall. But it was interesting that the only person my sons wanted to meet was Weary Dunlop. I think it said a lot for the man that in this day and age young men of 17, 18 and 19, upon seeing all of those great figures in the Great Hall, said, `Look, Dad, all we want to do is meet Weary Dunlop. We understand that you know him'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the cruelty and suffering that Weary Dunlop incurred as a POW, when the war was over not only did he not harbour any hatred or have any desire to carry out a campaign of retribution but he forgave his enemies. He went out of his way to befriend the Japanese who, only a few short years earlier, had inflicted such incredible cruelty not only upon him but also upon his close mates on the Burma railway. That, I think, reflected the man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a privilege and an honour for me to have known this great Australian. Australia is very much richer because of his life.

As I discovered after his death, some Australians who were captured by the Japanese and survived the war had not met him either&mdash;but, almost invariably, they knew of him and how he had assisted so many held captive during World War II. He was a remarkable man not only during the war but also during peace.</PARA></TALK.START>

I took the opportunity to introduce myself and told him that I was pleased to be able to speak to a living legend. We had a short conversation and then went our separate ways. Neither of us were to know that, in a few short months, crowds would gather in Melbourne to pay their last respects to this truly remarkable Australian. </PARA>

<PARA>As I left the cathedral after the casket was carried to a gun carriage, I was aware that Australia was the poorer for Weary Dunlop's passing. But to put those feelings in a more positive light, Australia was certainly richer for having Weary as one of its citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with all previous tributes about Weary. I think the point about Weary that has not been brought out was his essential humility. I think it was that humility that made everybody who had any contact with him fond of him and not feel threatened by his demeanour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weary was a wonderful character. In his honour I am wearing the tie of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons of which he was one of our most famous members. He annually attended the scientific congress to keep abreast of things; even as late as last year he attended it and gave us his wisdom, but always in a deprecating way. Senator Boswell has alluded to the fact that he was also a distinguished fellow of the Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, and he maintained that membership throughout his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to Weary Dunlop's humility, he had a great sense of humour. I was once sitting next to him at a conference and said to him, `Weary, as you get older, do you find your progress impeded in relation to your activities?'. Weary said, `Well, I am reminded of a fellow I was sitting next to at a dinner in London who called himself the Lord Privy Seal. The funny thing about him was that he was neither a privy nor a seal'. Weary added `But I said to him, "Lord Privy Seal, how do you find things as you get a bit older?". The peer said to me that he had been sitting next to some lady at a dinner one night and this lady had asked him the very same question: "How do you get on as you get a bit older?" The peer told me that he had said to the lady, "Well, my dear, as I get a bit older, I find that I am losing touch with my limbs". She said, "My Lord, if it is any consolation to you, the limb that you are losing touch with at the moment is not your own".' That was Weary; he was a wonderful character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He dedicated his life based upon what had occurred to him in the prison camps, but he did it in a self-effacing way. He became loved by everybody with whom he came in contact&mdash;and I think that was due to the essential humility he displayed in everything he did. He passes on now. He left a legacy behind that is an inspiration, as Senator Parer said, to the young men of this country. He did what he could, as a good doctor does today, despite the denigration of his profession. Despite that denigration, there are literally thousands out there who are doing the same today&mdash;and they should not be denigrated by those who seek to make political capital out of them. Weary deprecated that trend too in many conversations I had with him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in this place for the first time since my departure in 1990. Being one of the last speakers for the evening, I wish to offer my heartfelt condolences today at the death of Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. Like others who have spoken here this evening, I stood with many thousands of Australians at St Paul's Cathedral in July to pay tribute to the late Sir Weary Dunlop. Like others, I was acquainted&mdash;albeit fleetingly&mdash;with Sir Weary, having met and spoken with him on several occasions at several functions and having exchanged correspondence with him from time to time. But ours was not to the extent of Senator Parer's acquaintance, which goes back many years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I rise to speak tonight is that my generation was fortunate enough not to be called to arms. We were not called to serve in many of the great conflicts that have scarred the 20th century. Not having been called, as were Sir Weary Dunlop and his comrades, it is nevertheless our duty to remember the deeds and the actions of those who gave so much for our country. My generation is duty-bound to remember, to recall and to bring to life in the present the experience of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As evidenced by today's condolences, the Australian nation is engaged by Sir Weary Dunlop as it has seldom been by any other public figure. There was, after all, something in the essence of the man&mdash;some constant value&mdash;that touched all Australians across all spectrums of life. Like others who have spoken before me today, I do not find it hard to isolate those very values. The public record boasts of a life lived to the full, and there are few distinctions and honours achievable which eluded the man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there was something else in Weary Dunlop that I believe drew people towards him and kindled their confidence and enveloped their trust. There were many sides to the man. To my mind, his capacity to appeal to such a wide cross-section of society was based on his very Australianness. He embodied all the qualities that Australians aspire to and share in to differing degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These seem to be days of doubt and confusion as to what we mean by our `national identity'. Increasingly, we seem to be questioning what it is that we stand for and what qualities we ought to hold up before the world. This is a wasted feeling, and wholly unnecessary when we look at figures such as Weary Dunlop who selflessly expressed the simple but hard-won values of the past. Weary Dunlop reminds us that we must not sever the long line of collective national experience which marks the men and women of the nation and stamps the traits of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weary Dunlop was a bridge to the past. Weary Dunlop's legacy is more than just his personal heroism and private qualities. He was a constant reminder that in this nation's history can be found all the sources of inspiration and values that any nation needs to define its place in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At St Paul's Cathedral, when we mourned the passing of Weary Dunlop, we grieved for the passing of an era, for a loss of the past. We grieved for the man but the national hurt was even more than that. It was a sense of dislocation from our past that swallowed us up, the sense that something precious from our history was gone forever. Australia needed Sir Edward Weary Dunlop. It needed him to sustain the links with the nation's history, to keep alive the great continuity of nationhood which links one generation to another and which moulds us together as a people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Weary Dunlop, so much of the Australian character was forged in war. The better qualities of his nature, like those of Australia, represent a triumph over suffering and adversity. This is remembered by the nation when it recalls the Gallipoli campaign, the approaching 75th anniversary of the western front campaigns, and equally its modern day hero such as the VC recipient `Dasher' Wheatley. This has been the Australian story and one which should be renewed for every generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Weary himself saw to that. I recall an incident at the Canberra airport some years ago. He was in his early eighties at that time and a small girl, approximately eight or nine years old, approached him through the crowded airport simply for an autograph. Weary cheerfully obliged, so his story and the story of his generation was passed on to the newest of Australia's generation. We have to hold on to the memory of Weary Dunlop in the same way that we have to hold on to the memory of our past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not empty nostalgia or misplaced melancholy for some bygone era, nor is it an empty romance. If we are searching around for embodiments of values, we need not invent an image of ourselves or adapt some contrived bureaucratic self-perception. We only need to go back to our roots and our origins. If we are lost and thrashing around to affirm our identity, it is only because we have stopped remembering or else we have swallowed some national lie about ourselves which has written the likes of Sir Weary Dunlop out of our history. To this end, I honour Sir Edward Weary Dunlop and extend my condolences to his family. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is lives such as his that teach us that man can aspire to and achieve true nobleness of character and by doing so can inspire us all; Weary Dunlop would have been surprised to hear himself described as saintly, but to many his dedication to all that was good and his own sheer nobility of character seemed saintly; they set him apart, although he would have laughed and gently teased whoever told him that.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Ninian concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His death does not leave us the poorer; instead, because it concentrates our thoughts on him and on his life and example we are enriched and inspired. If we cannot emulate him, his great gifts of mind and of character eluding us, we can at least try to guide our actions by the pre-eminent standards that he made his own and by which we will remember him.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to have those words in the record of this parliament because I think they reflect very accurately the life of a very great Australian. Through that life, he was not just inspirational. His achievements and the nature of the man will guide us all in an inspirational way for many years to come.

As a matter of policy, a proposal of this kind would require substantial development by the applicant and analysis by the AFC before any decision to provide support is taken. The applicant would be required to provide a detailed outline of the project, including the proposed budget. Information about the aims and objectives of the organisation, management and financial structures and program delivery strategies would also be required.</PARA>

Clearly then, within the provisions of the Act, the Minister is bound to have regard to the Principles formulated under 39A(6) and 39BA(4) in exercising his discretion to approve an application.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The conclusion of the Nuclear Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia is under discussion with Indonesian authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. See answer to question on notice No 1257 of 25 February 1992 (Senate Hansard pp.180-181).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The objective of the proposed Agreement with Indonesia is to enhance existing and mutually beneficial scientific and technological cooperation in the peaceful nuclear field, including in such areas as nuclear medicine, radiation protection, nuclear-related safety information and applications of radioisotopes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Full details of the agreement will be made public in the normal way after signature. The Agreement would not provide for commercial transfers of uranium to Indonesia (see my answer to the question without notice in the Senate on 10 December 1991&mdash;Senate Hansard, pp.4485-4486).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. Australia has nuclear cooperation agreements with a number of countries primarily for the transfer of uranium and some of these also provide a general umbrella for wider nuclear cooperation such as nuclear science and technology exchanges. The agreements in the latter category are those with Canada, Egypt, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Russia and the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6)(a) A basic condition of Australia's nuclear cooperation policy is coverage by IAEA safeguards. All the countries listed in the answer to part (5) have safeguards agreements with the IAEA to enable IAEA safeguards inspections to take place. The IAEA has carried out safety review missions of some civil nuclear facilities in each of these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Pursuant to those agreements under which uranium has been transferred, the Australian Safeguards Office maintains regular contact with its bilateral partner through an exchange of information and visits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Article VI.A of the Agency's Statute provides that the Board of Governors shall be composed of 35 members, 13 of whom are designated annually for membership by the outgoing Board as the "most advanced in the technology of atomic energy including the production of source materials" and taking account of geographic distribution.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) No. Reviews run by the IAEA specifically related to research reactor safety come under the Integrated Safety Assessments of Research Reactors (INSARR) Program. This Program began in the 1970s and has applied mostly to developing countries to assist in the formulation of their regulatory standards. Before INSARR commenced, the IAEA periodically reviewed the safety of research reactors provided to member states under project agreements with the Agency. These circumstances did not apply to HIFAR. HIFAR's exemplary safety record, as attested by ongoing independent review, has not warranted an INSARR review. In any case, in accordance with Australia's view that ultimate responsibility for the safety of nuclear facilities rests with the sovereign state within whose territory the facilities are situated, final responsibility for the safe operation of HIFAR rests with the Executive Director of ANSTO.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Australia's position at IWC 44 (1992) and 45 (1993) concerning scientific whaling was to oppose the use of the provisions of Article VIII of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which allow for research involving killing whales, indicating particular concern where permits granted under national legislation to take whales for scientific purposes under those provisions appear, by their scale and nature, to subvert the intent of the moratorium on commercial whaling.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There was no meeting in Madrid in March 1993. A meeting was held in Madrid in mid-February for an informal exchange of views on a range of issues under discussion at IWC 45. The meeting was arranged by Dr Bridgewater in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the IWC. It was intended that the meeting could assist in undertaking some preparatory work for the Agenda at IWC 45.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Australia wishes to ensure the success of the Southern Ocean Sanctuary proposal and will strongly support its further development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent IWC meeting, Australia strongly supported proposals for further work to be undertaken on the sanctuary proposal, including: the development of a timetable for its implementation, agreement on management issues, and consideration of outstanding political, legal, ecological, geographical, financial and global environmental issues relating to the sanctuary. The recent meeting has also agreed to Australia hosting an intercessional planning meeting of IWC members to facilitate that work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)(a) At IWC 45 Australia opposed special relief allocations for small-type coastal whaling operations, on the grounds that evidence provided to date indicates a strong commercial component in trade and distribution of the products of such activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Australia opposes suggestions that such an allocation could be determined by a simple majority vote on a Resolution. At IWC 45, the request did not achieve support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Australia will not revoke its support of the Revised Management Scheme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Yes. Australia will support further development of Schedule amendments to incorporate additional provisions to the Revised Management Scheme to provide the most conservative achievable management regime. These include: 1) an effective observation and inspection scheme; 2) data standards; 3) agreed guidelines for conducting surveys and methods of analysis, to ensure that aerial and shipboard surveys meet stringent standards; and 4) agreed arrangements to ensure that all catches are taken into consideration. At IWC 45, a resolution to bind the Commission to implement the Revised Management Scheme in 1994 was defeated, largely on the initiative of Australia.</PARA>

Two other delegations said they would be making unilateral representations to Norway. While Norway's decision is regretted, under provisions in the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (1946) Norway lodged an objection to the 1982 vote on the moratorium on commercial whaling, therefore allowing them to legally proceed with commercial whaling if they so chose.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs has advised me that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Indian Environment Protection Act 1986 (EPA) no mining project can commence without an approved Environmental Management Plan (EMP).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Critics of the Piparwar project commonly claim that because there is no formally cleared EMP for the project it is proceeding illegally. This is not accurate. Mining at Piparwar was sanctioned by the Government of India in 1985, prior to the implementation of the Act, and thus there is no legal requirement for an EMP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An EMP for the project was prepared in 1989 prior to the implementation of the project. In November 1991, the Government of India advised that the Environment Department had assessed the EMP against the requirements of the EPA and recommended it for approval pending compliance with the requirements of the Ministry of Environment and Forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approval requires clearance by both the Environment and Forestry Appraisal Committees of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The Government of India has clarified that clearance by the Forestry Appraisal Committee is contingent upon provision by Central Coalfields Limited (CCL) and acceptance by the State Forestry Department of compensatory forest land equivalent to the amount of forestry land within the mining lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of India has advised in relation to the forestry provisions currently being applied to the project that mining at Piparwar can proceed on forestry land provided the State Government has received and accepted compensation for pockets of land as they are progressively mined. Thus, in 1991 the construction of a river diversion channel was stopped when the channel reached the boundary of a portion of forest land. Construction did not resume until the Forestry Department had accepted from CCL 13.1 hectares in compensation for an equivalent amount of land to be absorbed by the diversion. Updated advice from the Government of India is that CCL has now found sufficient land to compensate the State Forestry Department in full and that the project now meets the  forestry requirements specified in the EPA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government of India has recently advised that final clearance of the EMP is expected shortly. At the request of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, CCL has been asked to review the status of the project and update the EMP.

Based on the results of earlier informal ballot papers surveys, however, it must be said that such a result is highly unlikely: these surveys showed that informal ballot papers, to the extent that they can be read, were intended to go to all parties, but with more of them intended to be cast for the ALP than for the Coalition parties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The primary role of the North West Cape Communications Base is Very Low Frequency (VLF) and High Frequency (HF) communications. The Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) transmissions from the United States mainland, as referred to by the honourable senator, provides a complimentary, not an alternative, channel of communications for US submarines. In general terms, lowering the transmission frequency allows greater penetration of the sea by radio waves and this, for instance, would enable communications to be established with a submarine at greater depth. However, the increased penetration comes at a cost in terms of data transmission rate and consequently the major utility of ELF transmission is as a `cueing' signal to call the submarine to a shallower depth to receive more detailed communications by other means (such as VLF, HF or satellite communications). Australia has no perceived requirement for, and is not pursuing, ELF communications technology but has an ongoing requirement for the VLF and HF capability supported by the North West Cape Communications Base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian authorities have been aware of ELF development in the United States but it was not a relevant factor, and did not require to be raised, in the negotiation of new management and cost sharing arrangements for the North West Cape Communications Base.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Federal Government has committed $30 million for the proposed Rail Link to the Port of Brisbane under the One Nation rail infrastructure program. The proposal is a Queensland Government initiative, with a total estimated cost of around $89 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link will provide, among other things, a standard gauge access between the Port of Brisbane and the national intercapital, mainland rail network.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with the efficiency gains that will be attained by National Rail in the interstate rail freight sector, projects such as the Rail Link to the Port of Brisbane are helping to ensure that operations in that sector can be conducted efficiently and, over time, on a fully commercial basis without subsidisation from governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The option chosen by Queensland Rail (QR) for linking the Port of Brisbane to the national intercapital, mainland network involves a combination of the construction of new dual gauge track, and the dual gauging of existing narrow gauge track. This combination, while more costly than a single track dual gauge option, obviates the need to double-handle interstate rail freight traffic to and from the Port due to gauge differences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, who undertook some consulting work for the National Rail Freight Initiative Task Force, developed a preliminary estimate of around $10m to dual gauge an existing track. Consultants also found that this would not provide the operating flexibility of a separate line and that operation of passenger trains in peak periods could cause increased freight operations out of these hours, including night time operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">QR's option will provide it with greater scheduling flexibility, and will improve nationwide transportation movements and waterfront efficiency. The flexibility for QR to schedule coal, grain and freight trains in the day time was identified in the course of the Queensland Impact Assessment Study (IAS) as a significant operational benefit. This is noteworthy because the IAS found that the single most common source of complaint against the existing rail line is the noise from diesel-electric locomotives hauling freight trains, particularly late at night.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The Authority determines a salary range for each position based on the application of a proprietary job evaluation methodology. This method is supported by Jacques Martin Hewitt International and various market surveys performed by that company from time to time. Following a competitive selection process, and prior to signing a contract of employment, each General Manager appointee negotiates a salary package within the pre-specified range with the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The procedure then involves the CEO discussing the proposed salary package with the CAA Board Chairman before completing the appointment of each individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) All General Manager appointments have been processed in accordance with (1). The CAA Board reviewed all the proposed salary ranges with the then CEO prior to the first set of General Manager appointments in 1991. The question of any salary "increments" outside the predetermined range has not arisen. The Minister is not involved in the selection process other than to approve the creation of the positions in the first place prior to them being publicly advertised.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Lea argues that much of the Third World's accumulated debt is a direct result of foreign aid and loans from the World Bank and other regional banks. This is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that many developing countries borrowed large amounts from private banks during the 1970s and early 1980s. When real interest rates rose dramatically in the early 1980s, debt-servicing became a major problem for many developing countries. This, in turn, substantially reduced the ability of developing countries to attract private financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, private financial flows to developing countries fell from a high of 52 percent of net financial flows in 1980 to 34 percent in 1987. At the same time, official development assistance (ODA) flows to developing countries increased from 29 percent of net financial flows in 1980 to 54 percent in 1987. Thus foreign aid had a critical role in underpinning resource flows to developing countries in this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Loans from the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) to eligible developing countries are highly concessional, with no interest charges and 40-50 years to pay back the loan, including a ten year grace period. IDA further helps severely indebted countries, particularly in Africa and South America, through its debt-reduction and debt-servicing facility. The Asian Development Bank's soft-lending arm, the Asian  Development Fund (ADF), is also highly concessional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Providing aid through non-government organisations (NGOs) is one way of directly meeting the needs of the poor. However, NGOs alone are not the answer to poverty. Helping the poor requires a combination of strategies. While small-scale, localised activities directed specifically at the poor have an important role, they also need to be accompanied by measures which result in increased economic activity, improved services and better infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In 1991-92, 4.5 percent of Australia's aid budget was administered by NGOs. In 1992-93, the proportion was approximately 5.7 percent. This compares to 2 percent in 1983-84, 2.6 percent in 1987-88 and 4.3 percent in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australia's aid to individual developing countries is based on the needs and requests of recipient governments, and Australia's capacity to assist. This results in a mix of activities, some small-scale and some large, which varies from country to country. There is no merit in deciding at the outset that a certain proportion of Australia's total aid budget will be earmarked for small-scale projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of people's participation extends far beyond small-scale activities. The obstacles to the full participation of women in development remain one of the greatest development challenges. For this reason, women's needs are taken into account in the planning and implementation of all Australian aid activities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) GM has announced that it has put on hold its plans for high volume production. However, development work will continue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. It is not clear how large a void GM's announcement will leave. GM will remain involved in electric vehicle development, as will other motor vehicle manufacturers in the US, Japan and Europe. The resources that these companies are dedicating to electric vehicle development are far larger than those available in Australia. Nevertheless, Australia could have a role as a component supplier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) While there is considerable scope to improve the efficiency of internal combustion powered vehicles, it is not clear whether this is sufficient, or will be attained sufficiently rapidly, to-off set growth in global vehicle numbers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I refer the Honourable Senator to Table B. l: Commonwealth Government Budget Revenue (p4.55) in the Budget Statements 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Revenue collected from fuel excise is not hypothecated to energy research and development. Commonwealth funding for energy research and development takes two forms; indirect, through the internal allocation of resources in research institutions such as CSIRO and universities; and direct, primarily through the Energy Research and Development Corporation. Up-to-date information on the level of indirect funding is not available. Since 1988, the Energy Research and Development Corporation (and its predecessor, the National Energy Research and Development Council) has invested $296,581 in electric vehicle R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Since 1988, the Energy Research and Development Corporation (and its predecessor) has invested $1,069,956 in energy storage technology R&amp;D.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Energy storage is one of the priorities of the "Draft Research Strategy for Renewable Energy Sources and Systems" developed by the Energy Research and Development Corporation and currently being discussed with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) There is no national data how many kilometres per day the average urban motorist travels. Those passenger cars which travelled in capital cities in 1991, averaged some 30 kilometres a day. US data shows that, for first cars, 75% of all trips involve distances of less than 80 km, while for second cars, 90% of all trips are less than 40 km.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) While an electric passenger commuter vehicle with a range of 100 kilometres would prove adequate for the needs of the majority of urban motorists on a majority of days, it would not be adequate for their needs on all days, especially week-ends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The Government provides support for energy R&amp;D through a mechanism which has been designed to be responsive to the needs of industry and the community as a whole. This will help ensure that public funds are directed towards those areas which will provide maximum benefits to Australians. This mechanism provides a framework in which industry can take advantage of commercial opportunities to become involved in any emerging electric vehicle manufacturing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) 2025 is sufficiently far away that we can only speculate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As the Wetlands have not been the subject of any Commonwealth decision, and the State Government is moving towards the conservation of this area, processing of the Beeliar nomination has not been allocated a high priority. The Beeliar Wetlands is a large and complex nomination (2700 ha, consisting of two wetland chains, comprising some 22 separate wetlands or groups of wetlands).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) will install a new automated light at Point Perpendicular in February 1994. The existing Point Perpendicular lighthouse and associated buildings will then no longer be required by AMSA and AMSA has offered the site for sale to the Commonwealth. AMSA proposes only to retain sufficient land (some 200 square metres) for the new light and for a helipad for maintenance access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence has decided to acquire the site because it is the only remaining parcel of land affected by measures protecting public safety of the Beecroft Naval Gunnery Range, not already in Defence ownership. Defence control of this property will facilitate management of the range and ensure continued public safety during weapons testing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range fully surrounds the site on the landward side and the only access to the site is through Defence property. On the seaward side the site is bounded by 85 metre cliffs. Defence ownership is not intended to change existing access arrangements for recreation purposes when the range is not in use. The lighthouse visitors' parking area is already on Defence property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the remainder of the Beecroft Peninsula was acquired from the NSW State Government in 1979, but the lighthouse site, an area of four hectares out of a total area of over 4000 hectares of Commonwealth land on the peninsula, has never previously been on the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing Defence lands on the Beecroft Peninsula are managed by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Services under contract to Defence, at a cost of around $500,000 annually, under the general guidance of a draft land management plan developed in 1987, and now due for review.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Following discussions between relevant Ministers, I directed on 24 December 1992 that the Department of Defence commence planning immediately for the closure of Newington Armament Depot and the associated ammunition supply line between Kingswood and the anchorage in Sydney harbour, based on a timetable assuming Sydney will be successful in the bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. Should Sydney's Olympic bid be unsuccessful, the intention is still to vacate the depot and close the supply line, and to sell all or part of the site to the New South Wales Government or other bidders on the basis of a commercial decision. The precise timing for this can be decided after the International Olympic Committee decision in September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In clarifying the timing for closure of Newington, I further directed that an interdepartmental committee be set up, chaired by Defence, to examine and report to me on options for relocation of the depot and associated supply line. This committee should complete its report by the end of June 1993. I expect that the Government will then be in a position to decide the terms of a proposal for a new east coast armament complex (comprising a depot and a wharf) for submission to the statutory environmental impact assessment process prescribed under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No review of alternative location for the Newington Armament Depot has been put to the Prime Minister or Cabinet since 1990. However, I received in 1992 an internal Department of Defence review, initiated at the direction of the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel in October 1989. Subsequent to this internal review, I have directed that an Interdepartmental Committee (IDC) be set up to examine and report further on the issues associated with relocation of the armament depot and associated ammunition supply line. (See also answer to Senate Question on Notice number 291).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government is cognizant, of course, that any relocation of Naval armament facilities should be consistent with the long term location of the east coast fleet base. Adequate and simultaneous consideration will be given to both matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Strategic factors are always an important consideration in any proposed relocation of major defence facilities. In this case, notwithstanding the northern focus of Australia's defence strategy and the consequential imperative to locate some operational bases in forward areas, Government endorsed strategic guidance confirms the need for major bases, support facilities and training areas to be located in more southerly areas, less vulnerable to attack and close to essential Defence and civil support infrastructure. A critical function of the armament depot in question is to provide an Explosive Ordnance (EO) service to ships of the Royal Australian Navy. Such a service includes regular replacement of ammunition expended in practice, rotation of EO stocks for maintenance and removal of ammunition outfits from ships about to undergo major maintenance. All of these functions need to be carried out predominantly in a benign support environment prudently remote from the anticipated area of potential hostilities. Some EO, sufficient for short term operational needs, is indeed stored at or near the forward bases, but the requirement for a less vulnerable wholesale ammunition depot, more proximate to the primary support and training areas, is fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Point Wilson, near Geelong, is the only Port Phillip Bay site identified for further consideration by the IDC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The warship repair and maintenance requirement is only one factor influencing EO transfers to and from the fleet. The fact that AMECON might be well placed to perform such work is acknowledged but, similarly, it is Government policy to seek value for money through open and effective competition. Hence Navy does not envisage awarding any one organisation exclusive rights to all east coast repair and maintenance work. With regard to any security or strategic advantages of Port Phillip Bay, it should also be noted that the entrance and approaches to that bay would be difficult to protect from mining in the event of hostilities. All such factors will be taken into account during the Government's evaluation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Civil Air Operations Officers' Association (Civil Air), representing Air Traffic Control staff, has not advised the CAA that they have serious concerns about the safety of the airspace management arrangements scheduled for introduction on 11 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to the Authority dated 13 May 1993, the President of the Association stated, `The position of Civil Air has been that we would accept the CAA plan provided that the industry agreed and more importantly understood the changes, and further that practical procedures can be developed.' Additionally, in the same letter, the Association stated that it had `some difficulties with some of the practicalities', but `consultation continues.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a previous letter dated 7 May, their Vice President Administration, as Association project officer for the Airspace Classification System, discussed the matter of a statement on philosophy for the provision of services, mainly to jet operations. The issue of management of the traffic information to Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) aircraft about Visual Flight Rules (VFR) aircraft who enter Class E airspace without a transponder was also raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA considers that the matters expressed by Civil Air relating to the airspace model have been properly addressed through the consultative process that has been undertaken, and through the practical workshops which have had both industry and Association representation. This mechanism has allowed the Authority to work closely with these bodies to develop procedures and to ensure a common understanding of the changes.</PARA>

At a meeting with RAA pilots and two RAA Managers, the attitude was expressed that a directed traffic information service should be available to IFR RPT flights. The Authority is examining the feasibility of providing a limited service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Australian Airspace Classification System is the result of the most comprehensive consultation program ever undertaken by the Authority. It spans three years during which time every sector of the aviation industry has had the opportunity to contribute to the development of the system. At a consultative forum held in Canberra on 17 February this year, attended by representatives of the various sectors of the industry, an agreement, developed jointly by industry representatives and accepted by the Authority was reached on the way to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to this meeting, three days of workshops were held, on 7, 21 and 22 April, with industry and Civil Air representation at a technical level, to jointly write the procedures for the implementation of the system.

Jupiters Limited is the owner and operator of the Conrad Hotel and Jupiters Casino at the Gold Coast, Queensland, and licensee of the proposed new Brisbane Casino.

Australian shares, international shares, fixed interest, but reporting does not extend as far as investment returns, purchases or sales of securities at individual investment level. This would be an extremely difficult exercise given the many transactions undertaken by the Funds manager.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Minister has been advised by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) that the concerns of the Aboriginal community first arose not during any direct consultations in the past on mining at Iron Princess, but from an invitation to the Barngala (spelt Barngarla) people by BHP to visit a proposed waste dump site in the vicinity of mining at Iron Princess.</PARA>

However, a function of the appointment of a person under Section 10(1)(c) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 is to provide a report on the matters set out in Section 10(4) of that Act. These matters include the adequacy or otherwise of the processes used by the State, and by other relevant parties such as BHP, to ensure the adequate protection of significant Aboriginal areas and places which may be under threat of injury or desecration. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is not able to exercise his powers to make a declaration under the Act until he has received and considered the report which has been commissioned from the Hon Hal Wootten AC,QC.</PARA>
