<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the Government's decision a fortnight before the Cambodian election to provide additional forces to Cambodia, six combat helicopters and 100 troops, sandbags, barbed wire, first aid kits and other stores. Does this decision not confirm the seriously deteriorating position in Cambodia which the Minister, almost alone in the international community, has consistently denied?  How can a free and fair election take place when there is fighting between the factions, attacks on UNTAC, murder of settlers, a collapsed economy, shocking law and order and a breakdown of normal administrative functions?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="369" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is precisely in order to ensure that a free and fair election can take place in Cambodia in two weeks' time that the Australian Government has responded to this request, coming from the United Nations, for the supply of some additional equipment which will be very important in achieving that objective. The security situation in Cambodia has manifestly become more tense in recent weeks. It has been a fragile situation for some time. It is now an increasingly dangerous situation but it is by no means a desperate situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is, on all available evidence, the Khmer Rouge are determined to destabilise the election; they are determined to reduce the areas which are available for the free operation of polling stations; and they are determined, by these and other means, to discredit the election outcome. There is no doubt that that has been a longstanding political objective and is now being accompanied by some physical measures to make that more of an attempted reality. But there is no basis for the assumption that the Khmer Rouge are either trying to destroy the electoral process altogether or are capable of achieving that particular outcome. One of the reasons that are ensuring that is so is the absolute determination of the international community to proceed with these elections in the present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I would ask Senator Hill&mdash;because it is one that is appropriate for someone who has constantly been trying from the outset of this process to denigrate it, to talk it down, to overstate the problems that are associated with it&mdash;is: what are the alternatives?  What were Senator Hill's alternatives in 1989 to the quadripartite proposal which he did not like because it would have involved Khmer Rouge participation in the government? What was his alternative to the peace plan in 1991 which had the enormously self-evident virtue of not only engaging all the parties in the commencement of that process but disengaging the external patrons from support of their respective clients, which support was crucial to the maintenance of a process which had some hope of bringing peace and stability to the country as a whole?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a long debate. It is one that we have been having on innumerable occasions. The only common theme in it is the constant disposition on the part of the Opposition, led by Senator Hill, to articulate the kind of anxiety, the kind of doom saying, the kind of despair, the kind of pessimism which will be, unless carefully watched, a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is absolutely in order to avoid that kind of outcome that we and the rest of the community are responding as we are.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It is interesting that the Minister comes in here today and says it has been a longstanding political goal of the Khmer Rouge to bring down a peace process which is supposed to be based on national reconciliation. Arising out of the Minister's answer, I ask: what other governments have been asked to provide what further equipment and what has been their response? What is the quick reaction force which one of our helicopters will be supporting? What is the planned protection for civilian election monitors that the Minister is sending to Cambodia? What is to be the role of Australian forces in Cambodia after 28 May?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="369" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is manifestly absurd to seek a response to those questions in one minute. Let me say that the UN request was made a few days ago to the United States, Japan and the ASEAN countries, as well as Australia, since those countries were thought capable of deploying the necessary equipment most rapidly. Of the responses we know to date, Malaysia has offered eight Nuri helicopters and crews and the United States has offered to supply a whole variety of stores and equipment as well as to transport the equipment and aircraft offered by other countries in the region. We are still awaiting advice on the responses of the other countries approached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precise operational deployment of these helicopters and crews has not as yet been determined but it does look likely that they will be, as widely reported in the press, in the north-west part of the country where there is a manifest need for a quick movement capacity, both to ensure the effective conduct of the election and, more particularly, to ensure the safety and security of both the civilian and the military personnel in that part of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, of course, the case that the situation is dangerous&mdash;it is very difficult&mdash;but it also remains the case that the election can proceed and will proceed in May and, provided there is a little bit more confidence shown by the international community than Senator Hill seems capable of, that will happen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have actually been doing a few other things. The Government's decision to enable additional Australian carriers, such as Ansett, to operate with the opportunity to expand their operations into key Asia-Pacific markets is going to be extremely beneficial to the Australian tourism industry and provide a very helpful boost to employment. In facilitating the access of additional Australian carriers, and also providing opportunities for growth for Qantas, successful bilateral agreements have now been negotiated with many major Asian and Pacific countries, with capacity increases as follows: a 70 per cent increase in capacity with Malaysia; a 40 per cent increase in capacity with Indonesia; a 50 per cent increase in capacity with Singapore; and a 40 per cent increase, very importantly, with Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recently, I am also pleased to advise the Senate, Australia reached agreement with the Republic of Korea for significantly increased capacity with that country. This increase will see a doubling of available capacity in October this year and the ability for carriers of both countries to provide daily services by 1995. The significance of this agreement can be seen from the excellent traffic growth rates of over 35 per cent on the Australia-Korea route in recent years&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major beneficiaries of these initiatives in Australia's international aviation policy will undoubtedly be Australian tourism and trade. These developments will help build on the continuing growth in total international passenger traffic in Australia, with nearly 9 1/2 million passengers travelling in the year ended January 1993. This represents an increase of almost nine per cent on the previous year, despite continuing international economic conditions. That is very strong growth for Australia. Inbound passenger traffic for the month of January 1993 of 515,100 was the highest monthly amount ever recorded. It is an outstanding result.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Yesterday, I hosted a large delegation of representatives of pensioner and retired persons organisations. They raised the issue of the integration of Concord Repatriation General Hospital into the New South Wales health system, which will occur in seven weeks' time. What steps are being taken to ensure that high quality patient care for veterans will continue after the transfer of the Concord Repatriation General Hospital?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was able to address the delegation that Senator Childs referred to for a short time, but I know that a range of other issues were raised after I had to leave and come to the chamber to listen to that lot opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to indicate, as Senator Childs knows, that the Concord Repatriation General Hospital will be integrated into the New South Wales public health system on 1 July of this year. After transfer, the Repatriation Commission will continue to be responsible for veterans' health care and the repatriation private patients scheme will be introduced. This scheme will protect the interests of over 120,000 veterans and war widows in New South Wales who currently receive repatriation health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repatriation private patients scheme has been designed to shape health care to the changing needs of an ageing veteran community. The scheme will not only maintain the current level and range of services but, I believe, also bring a range of significant improvements. Benefits will include easier access to local hospitals; veterans and war widows will be treated as private patients; they will have more choices; and I believe they will have better options, including greater choice of specialists. It will mean that veterans and war widows can be treated locally instead of having to travel to Concord from all over New South Wales. The majority of veterans have indicated that local treatment is more convenient to them and their friends and families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 1 July, these veterans will have the choice of admission to a local public hospital as private patients without the need of prior approval from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The repatriation private patients scheme will ensure that veterans will also have access to a network of private hospitals and day surgery centres if no public hospital can treat them within a reasonable time. I want to emphasise&mdash;and this was raised by members of the delegation&mdash;that veterans and war widows who want to continue receiving their treatment at Concord can still do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concord is the second repatriation hospital to be integrated into the State health system. Hobart Repatriation General Hospital was transferred to the Tasmanian Government 10 months ago, and I think the new system there is working well. Since integration there has been an increase in the number of veterans who are being treated locally. I acknowledge the support and the cooperation of the ex-service community in bringing about these major changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our consultative mechanism includes the treatment monitoring committees, which will help ensure that the introduction of the repatriation private patients scheme occurs as smoothly as possible. The RSL, the War Widows Guild of Australia, the Veterans' Defence Services Council, TPIs, Legacy and the Regular Defence Forces Welfare Association are all represented on the treatment monitoring committees at both a State and a national level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that some veterans in New South Wales may be nervous about the changes, but next month the Department of Veterans' Affairs will mail information packages to every entitled veteran and war widow in New South Wales to help them understand the new scheme. I believe the introduction of the repatriation private patients benefits scheme reflects the Government's continuing commitment to a high quality of treatment services which meet the changing needs of veterans and war widows as they grow older.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the recent progress that has been made towards multi-party elections in South Africa. What is the Government's attitude to the lifting of those economic sanctions that are still in place against South Africa? What proposals has the Australian Government developed to assist Australian business firms to invest in and to trade with South Africa once those sanctions are no longer in place?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="373" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government remains wholly committed to the phased lifting of sanctions against South Africa, as was agreed by Commonwealth heads of government in Harare in 1991, whereby trade and investment sanctions will be lifted as soon as agreement is reached on appropriate transitional mechanisms, and financial sanctions will be lifted once the recommendation is made by agreement at the multi-party forum or by an interim government. We will certainly move very quickly to lift sanctions as soon as sufficient progress is made in negotiations to enable those conditions to be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am presently actively considering the questions of timing involved here with my Commonwealth ministerial colleagues. It is not at all impossible, on present rates of progress, that sanctions could be lifted sometime within the next few weeks, and indeed on all fronts simultaneously so far as trade, investment and financial sanctions are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that progress in negotiations in recent weeks has been very heartening, notwithstanding the obvious traumas associated with the assassination of Chris Hani; the death of the ANC's enormously respected former President in exile, Oliver Tambo; and also the continuing problems of reconciling the Inkatha Freedom Party and other more marginal organisations to principles that are essentially now agreed by the ANC and the South African Government. Notwithstanding those problems and difficulties, the process is moving forward.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The so-called playing Australia program, the touring program for the performing arts, is central to one of the key philosophical principles underlining the Government's arts policy and the initiatives outlined in the election. It is about increasing access in two ways:  firstly, to give people who live outside the major capital cities access to the major performing arts organisations in Australia; and, secondly, to enable organisations which have their origins in the smaller States and cities&mdash;for example, the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra in Tasmania&mdash;to tour elsewhere and get access to greater audiences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time, Senator Schacht answered a question about Australian science lending its skills to create lenses  which are destined for export to the Asian market. That is a commendable initiative. There has been, however, an Australian company, Interscan International, which is a fully owned subsidiary of AWA, which has won a $5 million contract to supply three microwave landing systems to Taiwan. The contract is with the Taiwan civil aeronautics administration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important breakthrough and it is an important contract for Interscan which is now in the high-tech top end of the aeronautical industry within this region. In winning this contract, it beat several significant firms from the United States and from Europe. Given this contract, it is now in a very positive position to win other contracts within the Asia-Pacific region where there is fast growing demand for services of this sort. There are another 10 possible systems to come on stream in the next four or five years in Taiwan. Given the fact that Interscan won the initial contract, one would imagine that it would be in the box seat to win the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people in government, in the Public Service and in private enterprise who worked together in order to win this contract. Indeed, Mr John Dougall, the chief executive of AWA, paid tribute to the Government and many others when he described this as a textbook example of the Government and the private sector working together to win a significant contract in the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>The last part of Senator Jones's question is about other high-tech or sophisticated manufacturing exports out of Australia to countries in the Asian region. The classification is `elaborately transformed manufactures' and there are success stories in Australian exporting in this area all over the region. Over the last five years our export of elaborately transformed manufactures has increased some 23 per cent in north-east Asia and some 27 per cent in South East Asia. In money terms, the value of elaborately transformed manufactures comes to $1.9 billion for South East Asia and $4 billion for north Asia and South East Asia taken together, which has now overtaken North America and Europe as a major market for elaborately transformed manufactures.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to make one final comment about these significant exports. We still have a perceptional problem to overcome in the region. When countries in the fast growing economies, particularly of the ASEAN tigers, think of where they should look for high technology, they do not often think of Australia first; they think of Europe, North America or Japan. There is a lingering perception in the region that we are an exporter of agricultural products and mineral commodities only. That is a perception that we all have to work hard to turn around because the facts are, recorded on the bottom line of our trade accounts, that one of the fastest growing areas of our export output is elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;high value added goods that take skill and learning to make. That is something that we have to change as a perception in this region so that more and more the significant growth that we have commenced burgeons further and achieves its full potential.</PARA>

In the Shan Memorial Lecture given in Western Australia, an extract of which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 16 August 1990, Professor Ross Garnaut, the newly appointed head of the Government's wool industry review committee, stated that in addition to removing all tariffs by the year 2000 it would be appropriate to remove anti-dumping arrangements as well. Given the disastrous consequence to many rural industries which would follow such a move, and given this Government's commitment to an effective anti-dumping regime to prevent a flood of subsidised imports stealing markets from our efficient producers, what confidence can the wool industry and the Government have that Professor Garnaut will not propose a similarly unworkable and industry threatening solution for the wool industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

But the delivery of the tanker <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northwest Sandpiper</EMPHASIS> earlier this year to her Australian operators symbolises the achievement of Australia's massive shipping reforms. This is the seventh specialised LNG tanker to join the fleet servicing the North-West Shelf gas project and the third to be Australian flagged and crewed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The construction of an eighth LNG tanker, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northwest Stormpetrel</EMPHASIS>, has now commenced in Japan. This will be required to boost LNG deliveries to Japan to seven million tonnes a year by 1995. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northwest Stormpetrel</EMPHASIS> will be the fourth Australian flagged ship in the eventual eight-ship fleet. Two of the other four ships sail under the United Kingdom flag and two fly the Japanese flag.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that I say this is a significant achievement and demonstration of the success of Australia's shipping reform is that the decision by the North-West Shelf joint venture to have these Australian flagged vessels was made on a purely commercial basis. The upgraded training and multiskilling, which are vital aspects of the shipping reform program, complemented by specialised company training have been instrumental in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northwest Sandpiper</EMPHASIS> being introduced with a crew of 22. The two earlier Australian crewed tankers currently operate with crews of 24, but they will also be reduced to 22 as scheduling permits. For those who are fond of making international comparisons, this contrasts with their Japanese and British sister ships, which have complements of 27 and 29 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three Australian flagged vessels currently in operation will carry 37 per cent of Australia's LNG export cargoes valued at $400 million. Freight earnings of $78 million will remain in Australia. The Government recently announced a further reform program to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the Australian shipping fleet. Despite pay television, I have only just had a meeting with some of the major representatives of shipping interests in Australia to ensure that that further round of reform takes place and is as successful as the last round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipping reform has already encouraged significant investment in new, modern tonnage, with 32 vessels joining the Australian fleet since 1987. It has been the biggest capital investment in new shipping in Australia in this country's history and would never have happened without the success of the reform program. There has also been an unprecedented improvement in the industrial relations environment in the shipping industry. Australian seafarers and ship management are proving that, given a fair chance, their skills and reliability are world class.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High up on the list of crimes against the AJA code of ethics in my view is misreporting the news; that is, going to a demonstration, seeing 100 people there and reporting it as a thousand. But a worse crime than that in my view&mdash;and it always has been&mdash;is censorship of the news; that is, distorting the news by omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can say what one likes in opinion columns. For years I have had a high regard for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. I have publicly said that in my view the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has carried the best and the most comprehensive account ever of the entire Coronation Hill debate. I have also kept a complete chronological clipping file of the uranium debate, because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> gave the best coverage of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying that if two officers issue a statement of news fact that this was by agreement, then no journalist in a news column is entitled to print that it was anything other than that, unless that person can demonstrate it was not. Journalists can speculate in opinion columns about that as long as they like, but they are not entitled to leave that out, and that is what they did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article contained 1,500 words. The only paragraph they did not print was the one containing the words `by mutual agreement'. Every other paper in the country carried that, despite opinion columns that asserted to the contrary, and they are entitled to do that. For example, the opening paragraph of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> stated that Christine Goode `has stood aside'. This was not the case with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. In that particular story&mdash;and I am confining my remarks to that particular story&mdash;the operative words, `by mutual agreement', in the statement were ignored and left out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> stopped being a newspaper of record. That is what I would like to know in respect of that particular story. Until the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> proved with investigative reporting or whatever that those words were not true, it should at least have printed them and acknowledged them. That was my complaint about the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, and I stand by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say this: if some of the journalists that comment in columns on the professional ethics of politicians, and suggest that they resign, applied so carelessly, frivolously, pompously and condescendingly the words `He is intelligent and he is nice but he should go'&mdash;</PARA>
