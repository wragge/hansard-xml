<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to re-enact important provisions of the Copyright Amendment Act 1989 (the Amending Act) in the Copyright Act 1968 (the Principal Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has recently been advised by the Chief General Counsel of Australia, Mr Dennis Rose QC, that due to the operation of section 55 of the Constitution the whole of the Amending Act has been invalidated as a result of a decision made by the High Court in March 1993. This opinion was provided after detailed consideration of the terms of the judgment and earlier cases on similar points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That decision, Australian Tape Manufacturers Association Ltd v The Commonwealth (1993) 112 ALR 53, was concerned with a challenge to the validity of the imposition, in the Amending Act, of a royalty on blank audio tapes. The Court held by a majority of 4 to 3 on this point that the royalty levied on vendors of blank tapes was a tax. In consequence it was invalid by reason of non-compliance with s. 55 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first paragraph of s. 55 of the Constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Laws imposing taxation shall only deal with the imposition of taxation and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his advice Mr Rose notes that "The High Court majority went on to hold that since the "royalty" provisions are inseverably connected with some of the provisions that are invalid because of the first paragraph of s. 55 the "royalty" provisions are also invalid. The result is that all the provisions in the Amending Act are invalid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the purported imposition of the blank tape royalty and associated provisions related to home audio taping, the Amending Act gave effect to a number of other very significant changes to Australia's laws on copyright and related rights. These were:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">adding new Parts VA and VB to the Principal Act providing for statutory licence schemes for educational and other institutions to copy, respectively, television and radio broadcasts and print copyright works;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">adding new Part XIA, providing, for the first time, a range of performers' rights;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">clarification of the relationship between the Principal Act and the Designs Act 1906 regarding industrially applied artistic works; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">streamlining the statutory licence for recording musical works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments were the third stage of important copyright reforms begun in 1984. They were formulated after extensive consultations by the Government with consumers, educators and industry participants. Members from all parties generally supported the 1989 bill and its reforms as being significant additions to the Principal Act. While some aspects of the protection proposed for performers and various matters of detail in drafting were the subject of debate and subsequent amendment during the passage of the legislation, the amendments have been relatively uncontroversial in practice, apart from the blank tape royalty scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not intend to repeat a detailed examination of the changes wrought by the Amending Act. Apart from the blank audio tape royalty that the Government has promised to reintroduce separately and associated provisions related to home taping of audio media, an overview of the other provisions of the Amending Act that this Act will retrospectively validate is substantively set out in the Second Reading Speech by the then Attorney-General Bowen beginning at page 2392 in the Hansard report of the 3 November 1988 House of Representative proceedings and beginning at page 3008 in the Hansard report of proceedings of the Senate on  28 November 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to emphasise that the provisions of this bill do not effect any policy change or new initiative. They are directed solely to re-enacting all the amendments to the Principal Act made by the Amending Act except those imposing, and related to the imposition of, the blank tape royalty. The validation is retrospective, operating from the respective dates on which the various provisions of the Amending Act were proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is some variation in the form of the re-enacting provisions. This arises for technical reasons due to the fact that the stages of commencement of various Parts of the Amending Act and the actual dates of deemed commencement of particular sections are now known.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be, in the Government's view, inappropriate to reopen any of the issues exhaustively debated late in 1988 and in the early months of 1989. A vast range of commercial and legal arrangements have been set in place, decisions made about the taking or assertion of legal rights and so on, all based on the presumption of the validity of the Amending Act, except, of course, the blank tape royalty. We do not envisage that any person would be unfairly affected by the reinstatement of the law by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have said, the bill is purely technical in nature. The invalidity of these provisions is an unexpected and unfortunate result of a High Court challenge to just one part of a raft of significant measures. I would hope that the Parliament would see the value of their reinstatement and of doing so quickly now that the issue of the invalidity of the provisions has been raised.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a lot of difficulties with the government's sales tax regime for the simple reason that the changes in sales tax, which the government introduces in the bills before us today, were not signalled to the Australian population during the election campaign. Much play was made by the government during the election campaign as to how it would save Australia from the goods and services tax. It was not, of course, talking about how it would save Australia from enormous reductions in sales tax&mdash;the abolition of sales tax&mdash;or how it would save Australian businesses from the removal of billions of dollars in costs, which is what the Fightback package would have achieved. We did not hear that. We did not hear the government saying, `By the way, we will add sales tax costs to business', which is the consequence of this. We will see increases in sales tax across the board, which will particularly hit this country's transport sector, and we have grave concerns about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted to put on record the coalition's objection to the way in which the government is handling these sales tax bills. In addition, it is highly irregular for a government to act in this fashion, to deceive the people by not telling them what its sales tax plans are and then race these bills through parliament. They are totally objectionable and the opposition feels they should not be agreed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee is considering message No. 106 and the request that was made by the Senate to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives considered the Senate's message, which requested the House to make certain amendments. There have been some concessions because the House of Representatives has not made the requested amendments Nos 1, 2 and 5 but has made requested amendments Nos 3 and 4.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition intends to stay with its previous strong position and disagree with the government's motion that the Senate not press the amendment. We disagree with that because we believe that that request has to be pursued and returned to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at some of the figures, we find that the revenue loss to the government is really quite significant. In terms of winning and losing, it is quite true that the winemakers have received a considerable tax concession in reduced sales tax and increased depreciation allowances for the planting of their vines. But against that scenario, they are concerned that if the Liberal Party presses these amendments and they are successful, the government will threaten or blackmail them with a tax excise proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the regime of a tax excise proposal, the government does not have to immediately introduce legislation to support that proposal. There would be no certainty that when that legislation is subsequently introduced in a few months&mdash;maybe in 10 months&mdash;it will necessarily pass the parliament, unless special deals have been done. They are the sorts of deals the details of which we are trying to extract from the government and those who made the deals with the government last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has to thank the Liberal Party for its very strong stand. Certainly it would not have got anything had we not taken such a stand. So it is not surprising that, following the deals that have been done, certain pressure is being put upon us to cave in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain the significance of the figures. Initially, the sales tax increases were expected to raise $70 million in 1993-94, $95 million in 1994-95 and $105 million in 1995-96. But they are now expected to raise only $17 million in 1993-94 instead of $70 million, and so on. But at the same time the wine industry will be provided with quite generous income tax concessions. We say to the wine industry and others that this could not have been achieved without the benefit of the very strong stance taken by the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was unfortunate that the debate was guillotined through the House of Representatives. The Liberal Party achieved some concessions there and we will continue to press our amendments. The government has put a motion before this chamber that the Senate should not press the amendments.

I did so in the hope that something would be done between the time the message left this chamber and the time it reached the House of Representatives. I have always indicated my view on the wholesale sales tax, which is that if the government believes it is the centrepiece of its long-term deficit reduction strategy, it is a matter that we should have regard to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should have regard to this provision provided the burden does not fall unfairly on certain groups, including people in my own state of Tasmania, families with children, unemployed and others within the community. The burden should not fall unfairly on those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now known that I have had discussions about these matters, as one would expect, because I represent the state of Tasmania. These discussions have proven to be somewhat fruitful in some areas. However, that raises another question; that is, how this chamber deals with the increase in fuel excise, particularly the increase in fuel excise on bunker fuel. The outcome of that remains to be seen. That is a debate for later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was concerned and expressed in this chamber that the tax cuts did not have regard to the principle of horizontal tax equity. In other words, there are a large number of families, particularly one income families, who are battling, who are only just making ends meet and who are paying their way, but they are the ones being neglected. Those people are middle income Australians who are on one income, have one, two, three, four or five children and are paying their way completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax cuts did not have regard to those people. The tax cuts were given to dual income families without children. They received the same tax cuts as single income families with children. In fact, a dual income family without children received extra tax cuts because of the operation of the tax free threshold. Those are the sorts of things that I have raised here and in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is an intention to focus on those issues. I know there is an intention by the government and I have heard that there is an intention by the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens to focus on this issue. The horizontal tax equity question is an area which has been neglected. It is understood that it has been neglected and we have to face up to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, so far as the WST, the wholesale sales tax, increase of one per cent in mid-1995 is concerned, it is important that discussions be held to ensure that the impact of those increases does not harm families with children. In other words, there should be some compensation entered into. That is one of the reasons the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced yesterday that there would be a dollar per child placed into the additional family payments scheme from 1 January 1995. That will be some months before the one per cent wholesale sales tax will come into operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of concern to me that the government chose to go down the track of indirect taxes as a centre piece of its long-term budget reduction strategy. I can understand the statements that have been made by the opposition in regard to this matter, particularly after it received a pasting by the government during the election campaign about indirect taxes&mdash;the GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were in the opposition's place, I would also feel that way. It might well be that I would also take the attitude that it is taking on this matter. Members of the opposition are saying, `We came clean during the election campaign and you didn't. You can stew in your own juice'. However, I am in a different position now, in that I need to have regard to this question of long-term deficit reduction strategy. I voted in support of the amendment moved by the opposition so that this bill could go back to the House of Representatives and so that further time could be bought, as it were, for the matter to be more maturely considered by all parties, including the government. I now need to reconsider my position, having regard to what has taken place in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said previously&mdash;and I acknowledge it&mdash;that none of this would have been achieved had it not been for the stand taken by the opposition. I acknowledge that straight out. It is quite true. However, in fairness, there has been a readiness by the government to look at things in a more reflective way and to come up with a series of proposals that will ameliorate the effect of the one per cent increase in wholesale sales tax in mid-1995 on persons who can least afford to pay that. This is what the government has done. Under all of those circumstances, it is my intention to vote for the proposition that has been put forward by Senator McMullan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point, though, that we need to distinguish between this measure and the fuel excise measure that will be before us later today. I will consider my position on that measure as the day goes on, as I have been trying to do over a period. I acknowledge that what the opposition, the Democrats and the Greens have done in respect of that has been important. I also acknowledge the actions of the government, particularly the Prime Minister, in ensuring what I believe will probably be a more reasonable result, having regard to the effect of the measure on persons who will least be able to afford it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage I think it is worth putting a few things on the record, especially for the sake of Western Australia, the state in which the two Greens reside, one of whom happened to be elected to this chamber on the spill-over of Liberal preferences. In newspaper articles this morning the Greens are claiming credit for altering the budget and getting the budget to where it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least Senator Margetts had the decency on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS> show this morning to acknowledge that, if it was not for the solid 36 votes that the coalition has in this chamber, the Greens would be irrelevant; they would have been able to do nothing. The position the coalition took the day after the budget was that we would vote against these measures because they would increase sales taxes. The Labor Party said during the election campaign that it would not do that, but we know what happened to that. I am glad that Senator Harradine gave us credit when he said that we were misrepresented during the election campaign. Now that is history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette claimed last night just before the adjournment that the Greens had got out of the government a $3 a week increase for the unemployed and an increase of $1 per child in family allowance from January 1995. But by January 1995 who knows who is going to be in government?  Senator Chamarette then claims, according to this morning's biased report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, that this will cost the government about $17 million immediately and $144 million in a full financial year. I believe that the people of Western Australia have to be told what the two Green senators have put at risk by extracting this small measure out of the government. I suppose a $3 rise for the unemployed is something, although $3 does not seem very much. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; it would not buy a packet of cigarettes. Not having been a smoker since I left school, I would not know the price of a packet of cigarettes. For those who do not have much money, $3 is a lot. But people's jobs are being put in jeopardy. There will be $3 for the unemployed, but they are already unemployed. This increase in sales tax will put a lot more people on the unemployed list or maybe give them a good fright that they are heading that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation we are concluding debate on now is worth about an extra $1 billion in increased sales tax. If it is cut by $17m&mdash;Senator Harradine said that that is not a great amount&mdash;in a full year that will amount to $144 million. The revenue from the increased sales tax is all extra; it is not a total bill. So the $144 million will not make a great dent in the whole budget. I am very annoyed that the Greens of Western Australia built up a profile on our solid 36 votes. As I said before, they would have been irrelevant if it were not for our 36 votes that never wavered and never will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the chamber some figures relating to the jobs that are being put in jeopardy. The transport industry alone&mdash;an industry that I know very well&mdash;employs 385,000 people directly and provides 2.4 per cent of GDP. How many of those jobs will be lost? I said in the second reading debate that a one per cent increase in wholesale tax does not seem very much, but when you are buying a new prime mover, for instance, to replace an existing one or as an extra one if you are trying to expand, it will cost you nearly $200,000 wholesale. That is an extra $2,000 immediately, then another $2,000 next March. So what will this legislation do to the transport industry?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Green senators extracted out of the government is minimal compared to what this legislation will do to the industry. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator PANIZZA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. We have a rise of $3 for the unemployed. There is a bill yet to come before the parliament relating to changes in Austudy for 16- and 17-year-olds. It will have the effect of transferring 16- and 17-year-olds from Austudy to family allowance. We will have our day to debate that one, but I know that it will reduce country kids' Austudy allowance&mdash;to be family allowance&mdash;by $8 a week. I would like to know how the Green senators will vote when that bill comes before the chamber. If they have claimed great victory for getting an increase of $3 a week for the unemployed and an extra $1 in child allowance by 1995, how are they going to deal with that bill?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, the Greens claim that they are the champions of not only Western Australia but Australia. In relation to the wine tax, they gave certain undertakings to the wine industry in Margaret River, but I think they might have given the industry some false hopes. They have now backed down on that issue. All Western Australians who can hear me this morning should be questioning the Green senators, Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts, as to why, after having led people to believe that they were standing up like this solid opposition over here, they decided to turn around and abandon the people of Western Australia. Maybe it was because of the fear of a double dissolution; I do not know. If we are to have a double dissolution, then let us have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyhow, the Green senators can explain that to the people of Western Australia. I urge people to question them as to what their motives are in this place. They have certainly put a lot of stable jobs in the transport industry, the mining industry and the rural industry&mdash;which provide Australia with the majority of its export income these days&mdash;in jeopardy. The government should do something about the unemployed in other ways, rather than giving a paltry $3 a week. The government needs to get the economy going so that jobs can be created. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Laws Amendment Bill 1993 effectively delays the introduction of last December's parliament-approved Migration Reform Act in that the start up date, which is in place at the moment, is 1 November this year. The amending bill before us will delay that date until September 1994. Rather than giving 10 months for the implementation of the bill passed by the parliament last December, it gives a period of 20 months. An initial part of the reform act which related to the establishment of the Refugee Review Tribunal was implemented on 1 July this year, but all other aspects are to be deferred by this bill until 1 September next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also introduces some amendments dealing with transitional arrangements which arise because of the delay. These are technical matters relating to definitions of unauthorised boat arrivals and the powers of the Refugee Review Tribunal to consider refugee status review applications made before 1 July 1993. These aspects are not controversial and the coalition has no difficulty in supporting them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the coalition is strongly critical of the main purpose of this bill&mdash;that is, the further delay of 10 months in the implementation of the Migration Reform Act. After all, the reform act is an important decision of this parliament, an important reform to migration arrangements. It makes significant changes to the legislative framework which currently underpins our migration program. It changes the regulation of entry to and stay in Australia as well as making changes to the provisions concerning detention and removal of non-citizens who are in Australia unlawfully. We in the Liberal and National parties strongly condemn the government for this further delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that there is an urgent need for solutions to the matters that were being addressed in our debate last December&mdash;which we thought had been resolved. This urgency continues, yet the government is unable to put a coherent solution before the parliament. The reason why the Migration Reform Act was considered so important last December was its urgency, yet the substance of that urgency is now being delayed by the government for 20 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons for deferral have been outlined in a number of informal and then formal meetings with parliamentarians by representatives of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). There is reference in the evidence of the special hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on Friday, 1 October to a number of briefings that were given to members of the coalition, the Democrats, the Greens and, I presume, the government back bench on this matter. I participated in these briefings. There was not an immediate credibility in the briefings that the coalition received. So our questions persisted. This situation led to the coalition requiring a formal Senate committee hearing on this bill so that the explanations given by the minister's representatives would be clearly in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appearing at the hearing were the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Conybeare; the deputy secretary to the department, Mr Richardson; and representatives from the legislative section of the department and also from the Attorney-General's Department. There were some private, or non-government, witnesses&mdash;not least Dr Cronin, whom I very much respect in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went through the several hours of discussion, as recorded in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of that hearing on 1 October, I saw a similar slowness in the explanations actually coming across to the Senate committee from those representing the minister and the Australian government. For instance, on page 88 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record, this question was put by my colleague Senator Short:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to know why a bill was drafted, passed by this parliament with bipartisan support, with a start-up date almost a year down the track and then subsequently found to be so badly flawed that it needs so much drafting and everything else flowing from that that it will be almost another year before its implementation. Perhaps it is a question that I should direct to Attorney-General's.</PARA>
<PARA>There was a slowness of answer to that question. It took another hour at least. Another of my colleagues, Senator Ellison, on the same page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true, is it not, that work has been embarked on this regime of reforms since 1989?</PARA>
<PARA>As a member of the parliament's Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations at the time when there was major foundational reform of migration law, I remind the Senate that there were 30 meetings. The then Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Robert Ray, is in the chamber. He understands the enormous consideration that was given back in 1989. A lot of time has passed. It is clear from this hearing on 1 October&mdash;and we must acknowledge it in this debate&mdash;that the government does not have a coherent approach to this, even now; and it is being put out yet another 10 months. Senator Ellison continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You brought in that code in 1989 with the review of decisions, which is what we are looking at here. So, in effect, the department has been engaged in an ongoing review of this situation for the last four years.</PARA>
<PARA>The present minister, Senator Bolkus, made an announcement yesterday regarding a special arrangement for Cambodian boat people. This announcement has been made before the parliamentary committee has completed its inquiry into detention on the grounds of illegal immigration and arrival in Australia, due in December. We have carts before horses; announcements before reviews have been completed; and a lack of credible coherence from the present minister and from the government. In this context I take up a question asked by my colleague Senator O'Chee at the hearing on 1 October, which appears on page 85 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you table a list of the further amendments that you require to help this committee?</PARA>
<PARA>That was a good question, I put to any member of this Senate, and a question that he had to repeat half an hour later and, yet again, an hour and a half later without getting a satisfactory answer. He was told, `There are about 40 amendments'. He was then told, `Most of them are technical; most of them are typographical'. The question was still put, `But what are the amendments? You have had 10 months since this bill was adopted by the parliament and you are wanting to bring in further amendments but you can't describe what they are'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from being told on several occasions that there are a number of substantial amendments, it is still not clear that the minister or his advisers have a clear view as to whether there are one or two amendments or up to 20 or 40 amendments, and so on. It will only be as we near September next year that we will, I suppose, receive a coherent approach from the present government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the hearing on 1 October an insistent question was put by my colleague Senator Short. It appears on page 101 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and relates to the one major amendment to this bill that the coalition was foreshadowing. That amendment was to the effect that if the government wants the greater part of the reform act of December 1992 deferred for 10 months, there is one element&mdash;the matters that relate to the proposed section 4B, the grounds for judicial review of an immigration decision&mdash;that it should at least allow to be on time, on 1 November in two weeks time. What consequences would there be if our foreshadowed amendment were adopted so that this element would actually be on time? This is a matter which is of very real concern to Liberal and National party members and, I understand, to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When that question&mdash;the nub of this whole hearing&mdash;was put, after a couple of hours of preliminary discussion, the secretary to the department, Mr Conybeare, remained silent. The deputy secretary, Mr Richardson, gave a one sentence answer in which he passed the buck to the legislation officer of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Metcalfe who, on page 101 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might just speak briefly and then defer to the expert advice that parliamentary counsel might be able to give you.</PARA>
<PARA>A little later, Mr Byles said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of Parliamentary Counsel has prepared a paper raising some issues. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The nub of it is still indirectly given in the couple of pages that followed. I say that to make it clear to the government that we in the opposition are not impressed by this lack of coherence in the government's approach and by the way in which it can account for its views before a responsible Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that so many members of the Australian public are confused about immigration management by this government when this evidence lies before us, and when there is this 20-month delay for a matter that was regarded as urgent&mdash;even by the government. The Australian people want to see an immigration program which has integrity, which is non-discriminatory, fair, sound and well-managed, with accountability for every element of its management. All of those matters are seriously lacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no alternative but to conclude, along with my colleagues, as a result of the hearing on 1 October&mdash;especially in regard to the advice of Dr Cronin, whom I regard as a genuine expert in these matters&mdash;that our foreshadowed amendment to bring one element of the act into force on time on 1 November this year will not be integrated, practical or able to be implemented in isolation from the other elements in the act. Even together, there is not a convincing coherence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the rather tardy and incoherent evidence that has been given, the opposition will not proceed with its foreshadowed amendment. Rather, I will move a second reading amendment condemning the government for its mismanagement and incoherence. In the next few days, on behalf of the opposition, I will move a motion to recommend the setting up of a responsible Senate committee inquiry into all parts of the government's handling of immigration in this country. My colleague Senator Short has discussed the terms of such an inquiry quite widely in the community and with other honourable senators. I am concluding those discussions in the next day or so. At one stage I intended to move an amendment to the second reading motion proposing the establishment of a Senate select committee to inquire into the department's management of immigration matters, but instead I will give notice of a motion along those lines on one of the next few sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is still concerned that part 4B, which relates to the grounds for judicial review of an immigration decision, has, on Dr Cronin's testimony, been seen as still inadequate to achieve the purposes that the Liberal and National parties would want it to achieve. There is an unsatisfactory legal foundation for this properly building in of the notion of natural justice to the whole procedures of review within the department that would limit the grounds for external judicial review of any immigration decision. We want to see, in the new year, the coherent approach that we are still waiting for after all these months from the government; we want to see that it will be watertight, sound, workable and capable of achieving the objective that we all addressed last December in this debate, as well as now. On behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"but the Senate condemns the Government for its legislative and administrative incompetence in failing to achieve the timetable for implementation of the Migration Reform Act which was determined by the Parliament in December 1992.".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this important bill&mdash;the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited Sale Bill 1993&mdash;even though it relates to only a small entity. The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Limited was originally started as a corporation following the end of the Snowy Mountains scheme in 1970. It has been a very successful corporation. It currently has about 240 staff and has completed over 1,700 projects in 54 countries. Eighty per cent of its work has been done offshore. It has an international reputation of the highest standing. This last financial year its turnover was $56 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation is in a business which has very good opportunities for growth in the future&mdash;in other words, selling engineering services out of Australia&mdash;particularly since the deterioration of the Australian dollar in recent years. The corporation changed to a company by a government bill in July 1989. At the time, the opposition moved the following amendment to the bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At end of motion, add ", but the Senate is of the opinion that the Government should sell the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to the private sector, with the first option to purchase being given to the Corporation's employees".</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition agrees 100 per cent with the government in privatising this corporation. We also agree that equity should be offered to the staff of the corporation. The purpose of this bill is to do just that, and that is what is happening now. Apart from a delay in carrying out the privatisation, we welcome the move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two important constraints on the sale: the first constraint is that the head office of the corporation must stay in Cooma for at least five years; and the second constraint is that the staff should be offered equity. Again, the coalition supports those constraints on the sale. However, we are critical of how the sale has been managed and the time delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister announced in March this year that negotiations had commenced with Tinbury Ltd, which is the company set up by some staff members of SMEC. However, since then, no other parties have been allowed to negotiate with the government or even hold a discussion with SMEC staff and we are concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our major concern is the valuation process. Here we have a company which, according to its annual report which came out a couple of weeks ago, has a balance sheet showing net assets of $10.2 million and a profit for the last financial year of $1.1 million. So it is a successful entity. I might add that it has not always been successful. Prior to its new board and its new management being formed in 1989, there was a series of years of substantial losses. The organisation has been turned around in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the process of selling the corporation. In the absence of a tendering process, one would be forced to conclude that the sale price ought to be of the order of what is shown in the balance sheet. After all, the purpose of the balance sheet is to show the value of the corporation. In other words, the value of this corporation is around $10 million. But we do not know the selling price of the entity. The coalition insists that the government must advise the parliament of the details of the sale price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The negotiations have been going on for quite some time. It would appear that the purchase vehicle, Tinbury, may be in trouble in raising capital. I did a check with the ASC and in a report submitted to it on 4 June this year it appears that Tinbury has paid-up capital of only $119,000. That is rather minuscule for the vehicle seeking to buy an entity worth of the order of $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask whether the staff are having trouble raising the capital. As an outsider looking at the situation, if we assume that Tinbury is having financial trouble, then an alternative would be for the corporation to offer an employee share ownership scheme to the staff. In that way the corporation itself could finance the employees into the entity. In order to do that, one would have to open up for public tender, or certainly public offers of purchase, a significant proportion of the entity to other companies. </PARA>

I would have thought that perhaps a sensible way for the government to go would have been to offer for sale 51 per cent of the shares by some tendering process with the condition that the other 49 per cent of the shares be offered to the staff through an employee share ownership scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicated at the second reading stage that I would be moving three amendments to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2). Two of the amendments that I foreshadowed are relevant to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1). The first is a request that the bill be split in order that it be put in a clearly constitutional form. I do not want to waste the time of the chamber by reiterating an argument that has now been put several times. I simply say that the opposition remains concerned that advice from leading constitutional lawyers in this country is that there is a very serious doubt as to whether this bill would stand challenge in the High Court. It is our view that it is the responsibility of government to put its legislation in clearly unambiguous constitutional form. The deficiency could be very easily rectified and the government should, even at this late stage, do that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I will summarise the amendment. The argument is very familiar to the Senate; it is that the  bill be divided into four separate bills. Firstly, there would be a bill for an act to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in relation to fringe benefits. Most of that, I think, is going to be withdrawn; nevertheless, to separate what remains of the fringe benefits area is constitutionally important. Secondly, there would be a bill for an act to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in relation to the taxation of payments in lieu of annual leave and long service leave. Thirdly, there would be a bill for an act to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 in relation to the taxation of credit unions.

So, in other words, they support the principle and they still would have preferred to see the government put the bill in constitutional form, but they will not be voting with us in the committee on this presumably because there is still some element of uncertainty, even if it seems to me there is really not because the government could take it out and split it exactly as we have said and have it back here within a matter of a couple of hours.

That is not to say that it is impossible; sometimes things do occur that have implications for a whole lot of bills in the past and where an assumption has been made that is incorrect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government actually seeks to repeal the concessional treatment of unused annual leave. This must be questioned on grounds of equity and fairness. For that reason, I support the amendment to remove the retrospective elements from this legislation. At the same time, I acknowledge that the government has had a change of heart about taxing concessionally the long service leave component. In other words, the government's proposals in terms of the long service leave component will only apply as from budget night, 17 August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, the coalition is concerned that the retrospective element of the tax increase on annual leave was not removed at the same time as the long service leave component was. During the committee stage we will take the opportunity of supporting that amendment to remove the retrospectivity in terms of annual leave. The Liberal and National parties have always upheld the principle that changes in taxation legislation should be prospective and not retrospective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to remember the rationale for these so-called concessions. When, on termination, an employee receives a payment in respect of unused annual leave, the amount received would force most taxpayers into a higher tax bracket. Thus, the taxpayer receiving such amounts would be required to pay tax on the accrued entitlement at a higher rate than would have been the case had leave been taken during their employment. We acknowledge that the top tax rate for individuals has been reduced over the years but, because of bracket creep, taxpayers are coming into higher and higher brackets. Personal tax scales are still based on the theory of a progressive taxation system. As a result of this budget change, in the absence of such a concession many taxpayers with accrued annual leave entitlements will face a higher marginal tax rate in respect of a lump sum payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Present entitlements with regard to unused leave are also adequate when one considers the present economic climate. Many employees are being forced to resign with little prospect of another job in the circumstances. They may fall short of a bona fide redundancy and lose out on concession, depending on the circumstances of the business at the time. For that reason, I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting the amendment to remove the retrospective element in terms of the annual leave component put by my colleague Senator Hill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to support the amendment moved by Senator Hill on this point. There are two questions at hand here: the first relates to the retrospectivity, as Senator Watson pointed out, of the decision to remove concessional treatment of accumulated leave&mdash;and I will stick to accumulated leave in this case. The other relates to treating accumulated leave retrospectively dating back to 1978.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that leave is accumulated for some compelling reasons at times. As an employer, I have found that out. Families cannot simply take annual leave at a particular time for various reasons. They may not be able to take leave in a seasonal year, or they may be under financial pressure and unable to afford to take holidays at that time. It is recognised by the government and successive governments through the existence of leave loading that generally it is more costly to be on holiday, especially if people go away from home. So there are reasons why people accumulate leave, and I have only mentioned some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accumulated leave is treated concessionally in the tax system, but I do not believe that that is a reason why people would accumulate leave. I believe that there are pressing needs in relation to accumulated leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another point, I do not believe that the proposed retrospective tax would amount to much. I do not think the government has told us what the difference would be to the tax intake of the government by retrospectively taxing accumulated leave. I am not talking about from here onwards; I am talking about the retrospective angle. I do not have an idea of what sort of figure would be involved. I do not think there would be too much leave accumulated from 1978&mdash;that is 15 years ago. I believe that leave would have been taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers encourage employees to take accumulated leave and not let it sit there for so long because, as wages rise, employers are up for more money in the long run. I know that inflation comes into it, but employers would be up for more money. I doubt that there is much accumulated leave around. If the minister could give me an idea, I would like to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problem with the government removing the concessional treatment of accumulated leave and long service leave because I do not know the real reasons why it was treated concessionally in the past, except that it may have been to help the families who had to accumulate their leave rather than take it. I have nothing against taking it away, but I am certainly against taking it retrospectively because, as I say, I believe there is not too much accumulated leave. Those who accumulate leave should all be subject to the tax angle from the day the legislation comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would like to make is that there is still some concessional treatment of accumulated leave in the instance of death. If a person dies while still in the work force, accumulated leave is paid out after the date of death and it is still treated concessionally. Not only is it treated concessionally, but also it is treated as zero. Perhaps the minister could tell us whether he has any ideas to change that because I would certainly be against that sort of thing. It is never a great amount of money at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that from experience. Only a few months ago I was cleaning up an estate; it was under $10,000. Of course, it helps the family in that immediate time after the death when they have to pay for the funeral. If they have no income coming in the door, it does help. I would like the government to indicate whether it will leave that concession and also to respond to my other questions. </PARA>

Many people in the armed forces cannot take their annual leave annually, so it accrues from time to time. One of the pieces of correspondence that I received on this particular measure referred to that fact. It seemed to me that it was a very real case for concessional treatment to be maintained. I think the government ought to look at those things in calmer moments and see whether something could be done in respect of those occupations by virtue of which, in many cases, people are unable to take their annual leave annually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always argued very strongly for people to take their annual leave annually. It has been my view over many years that annual leave was fought for and won so as to ensure that workers had a complete break from work&mdash;a consecutive break from work&mdash;every year so that they would be renewed and so that they would be able to spend this time with their families and thus meet that obligation as well. </PARA>

If a person's marginal tax rate is less than 30c and it changes, it impacts upon that person's accumulated annual leave. This has always happened to low income earners. We are just saying that the same thing should apply to everybody else. Those opposite are up in arms saying, `This is an outrage. What an attack upon the basic principles of equity in the tax system.

If someone had 12 weeks leave accumulated and we changed the tax law, the tax rate would apply to those people and they would pay tax on leave that they accumulated when the rate was 20c; if the rate were to go up to 25c, they would pay 25c on it.

That appears to be growing at quite a significant rate. In terms of equity, fairness and ability to compete, I think that about the right sort of balance has been achieved as a result of these measures.

The credit unions are saying that they are not averse to paying tax, but they feel really strongly about losing mutuality.

<PARA>The deductions are then outlined in subparagraphs (a) and (b). </PARA>
<PARA>The credit unions are saying that they should pay tax at the corporate rate on their non-exempt income. While this amendment might look to be the same on the face of it, in fact it represents a significant change which will result in a different way of paying the tax that the government is seeking while preserving the principle of mutuality. I think that we should spend a little time to make it possible for credit unions to preserve that important principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that those who seek finance have a choice. It is important that the services of non-profit cooperatives to their members be retained wherever possible. If we proceed with these amended taxation proposals, we will take away the way in which credit unions enjoy the benefits of mutuality and the benefits which flow on to individual members from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, all one needs to do is buy a share. One does not need to turn up with a long list of one's assets and liabilities in order to enjoy the mutual benefits of belonging to a non-profit cooperative. As we move towards concentration in the banking sphere, we need to preserve the functions and the services for those ordinary Australians who prefer to deal with a credit union for a whole lot of principled reasons. We should not seek to remove that option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that the government can have its revenue. It can have the best of both worlds. We might have some difference of opinion over how much revenue is raised here, but it depends on how strongly we feel about the principle of mutuality. Petitions on this matter were lodged today in this parliament. Of the 150,000 signatures on those petitions, 50,016 were under my name, 53,000 were under Senator Hill's name, and I think another 50,000 were under Senator Chamarette's name. People do understand what the flow-on from this measure would be. The credit unions are not seeking to avoid giving the government the revenue; they understand their obligation to do that. </PARA>

I am just saying to the government, `Would you please consider this other proposition because of the benefits that it gives to ordinary Australians?'. The benefits of mutuality really come down to a share in lower fees, or no fees, and a share in the right to get personal loans of below $2,000, which the banks will not look at. It is an appeal to the government to take this money and preserve the principle of mutuality at the same time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support Senator Kernot's amendment and also make an appeal to the government. I am amazed that the government was unable to hear the weight of the argument presented in the inquiry, which was certainly convincing to me, particularly from people from its own side who spelt out the beginning of credit unions within the labour movement as part of its understanding in those days of the importance of social justice. I wonder whether the government really understands what social justice is about and the distinction between social justice and social welfare. There is a very strong line between the two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise that, in terms of mutuality and cooperation among people, the credit union movement has underlined the ability of people to have empowerment in the financial area against the disempowerment that they experience, particularly through the banking system, at present. Of all people, members of the government ought to understand that principle and ought to be supporting people who want to join together in order to find an alternative to the system which they believe delivers to them not justice, but injustice and oppression. This is of critical importance to us and ought to be of critical importance to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry I addressed a question to the minister about housing cooperatives. He gave an assurance that this measure would not flow on to groups such as housing cooperatives. I am afraid I really wonder about the government's intention in these areas because housing cooperatives too were formed for the very purpose of empowering people, so that those who have suffered as tenants for years might have a way of taking control over their own lives. I was involved in the formation of a number of those cooperatives in Queensland against incredible opposition from Joh Bjelke-Petersen's National Party government, which could not see any benefit in the cooperative movement. It attached to it such labels as communist, socialist and all the rest. All of us know of those kinds of slogans which were used in the past. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social policy that the credit unions represent is played out through the credit unions' exemption from tax under section 23G. Even the largest credit unions in Australia are substantially smaller than the smallest bank; the vast majority of credit unions occupy a tiny proportion of the financial sector. While credit unions are small, they provide a significantly different style of financial services to their customers. Their customers are all members who are able to borrow money from their institutions while others are unwilling to lend. We do not believe that the government's proposal and the committee's proposal is needed to differentiate between smaller and larger credit unions. </PARA>

This is a very important tenet of regionalism and community development and a very important basis to the Greens' support of credit unions. They have to rely upon self-generated capital, which is an important value, as this allows them to remain community based but forces them to hold on to money that they generate to protect depositors and permit asset growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be supporting the Australian Democrats' request, because it will achieve the budgetary aims of the government while protecting and enhancing the mutuality principle, which is so important to the philosophical direction underlying credit unions. As Senator Kernot has said, it will increase credit unions' tax payments without disturbing the central principle in section 23D. The Credit Union Services Corporation (Australia) Limited has estimated that if this provision had applied in 1992-93, at the new corporate tax rate of 33 per cent the tax paid by credit unions would have amounted to approximately $23 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats had not moved this request, the Greens WA would have done so.

<PARA>Again, the opposition is moving a request to split, in this case, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2) 1993 to put it into constitutional form. This is the so-called test bill which even the government acknowledges contains constitutional doubt. As I said earlier in relation to the first bill, our argument is that that is not the way to properly conduct the legislative process. If there is doubt as to constitutionality that doubt should be removed before the bill is put for passage in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My request is to remove that doubt by the bill being split into two separate bills: a bill for an act to amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Act 1986 to increase the rate of fringe benefits tax; and a bill for an act to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 in relation to friendly societies.

We hope that others might change their minds at the last minute, that they would agree to the principle that I have just put and require the government to remove the constitutional ambiguity in order that this place could then vote in a way in which we could be reasonably sure that what we are passing is constitutionally valid. </PARA>

I think it marks the high point of the government's erratic and irrational behaviour over this budget. I think this Senate should be very conscious of the costs of this behaviour, supported by the Australian Democrats. The government is imposing these costs on the Australian community by virtue of singling out this bill as a test bill&mdash;a bill that has to go before the High Court.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate as Minister representing the Prime Minister and relates to Mabo. I refer the minister to the statement released yesterday by Lois O'Donoghue, the highly respected chair of ATSIC, and also made on behalf of the Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations working group. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compensation will be payable for past extinguishments of native title.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the minister: what are the limitations to that? Is it not inconsistent with what he said here yesterday in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of valid grants, which are presumed to be the overwhelming majority of those that have been made in the past, no question of compensation will arise. Extinguishment, according to the High Court  . . . has been already accomplished.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2196" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is no different from the one that I have given on many previous occasions: compensation is payable in respect of the act of extinguishment only in relation to situations where invalid grants of title in the past are validated as a result of the legislative processes that will be set out in the Mabo legislation. It is the case that previously valid grants of title, which have had the effect as a matter of law&mdash;so the High Court tells us&mdash;of extinguishing such native title as may have existed, will not give rise now to a claim for compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat, the only claims for compensation that will be payable in respect of extinguishment are those that will flow from certain situations where validation now occurs. Those situations are limited ones in relation to pre-1975 titles. They are limited to the extremely unlikely situation of the court finding that the existence of native title in conjunction with some other law&mdash;for example, a law relating to fiduciary duty&mdash;has had that effect of invalidating the grant in question, and I do not think anybody really believes that there will be any such cases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There may be some, but I do not think anyone seriously believes that that claim will be able to be sustained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of post-1975 leases&mdash;there is a maximum of only 11 pastoral leases which would seem to give rise to this situation&mdash;to the extent that there is any doubt about their validity, they will be the subject, of course, of validation by the proposed legislation. Whether there is any doubt about the validity of the leases in question will depend on determination in due course by the courts, if the matter is ever challenged. The argument would have to be that the Racial Discrimination Act applies either to require procedural justice which was not delivered or to require compensation at the time which was not paid. It will be a matter, of course, for argument as to whether that is so. But I repeat: it is only in a small number of cases that that situation will arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compensation questions, of course, do arise in relation to valid grants of native title that apply in the future where economic uses of a different kind are authorised by the process that is proposed. That will give rise to claims of compensation for impairment of the native title or in other contexts that are spelt out in the outline. I think there has possibly been some degree of confusion in references to compensation meaning to extend to that context as well as to compensation for validation of previously invalid grants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a supplementary question. Judging by what the minister has said, it appears that the chairperson of ATSIC has misunderstood the extent of the compensation that will be available to the Aboriginal community. I ask the minister to say whom he thinks is responsible for these false expectations.

I have only Senator Hill's word for the words that were used&mdash;that compensation is payable for past extinguishment of native title. There is a context in which compensation is payable for extinguishment, and that is the context that I have just described.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government's response to accusations that President Yeltsin has abandoned democracy in Russia by imprisoning his opponents and censoring the mass media?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2198" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of reports have been put about in the Australian and international media claiming that recent actions by President Yeltsin dealt a fatal blow to democracy in Russia and signalled a return to totalitarian rule, as well as variations on that theme. I think those reports are very misleading indeed, essentially because they are based on the false assumption that Russia already had some kind of parliamentary constitutional democracy and as a result had something to lose from President Yeltsin's actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the parliament dissolved by President Yeltsin on 21 September was elected in 1990 when Russia was merely the largest administrative region within the Soviet Union and therefore subject to the rule of the Soviet government. Not only was there no thought then of this parliament acquiring a role in the government of Russia as an independent country; but much more importantly, even at the time of its election, the parliament's democratic credentials were extremely compromised by the Soviet Communist Party's manifest manipulation of the preselection and voting procedures. The Russian constitution was an equally discredited relic of Russia's Soviet past. Its obsolescence was highlighted by the fact that the Congress of People's Deputies amended it more than 300 times in the two years that it had the chance to work on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said in the Senate, in the Australian government's view President Yeltsin made a sustained effort to find a workable compromise with the opposition leadership. But once that opposition leadership had resorted to force, he had no option but to respond in kind. Subsequently President Yeltsin imprisoned the leaders of the insurrection and suspended a number of media outlets which openly supported the insurrection. But over the following week he released all but 60 of the 1,200-odd people who were imprisoned, and some of the opposition newspapers are again being published, albeit under new livery. However, a ban does continue to exist on 12 publications and one television program. I certainly share the concerns that have been widely expressed about these bans and I hope they will be lifted very shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real test of President Yeltsin's credentials&mdash;whether it was the case, as it appears, that he was violating the letter of democracy only in order to preserve its spirit&mdash;will depend on how quickly and how fully we now see the establishment of constitutional government and a democratic legislature. In this respect it is a very welcome development that President Yeltsin has now reconfirmed that the elections for both chambers of the new parliament will go ahead on 12 December and has welcomed international scrutiny of them. The Australian government will continue to support action which helps Russia to advance down the difficult path toward democracy and a market oriented economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reference to native title equivalent rather than native title as such is simply an act, I guess, of lawyer's caution in the sense that what is being proposed for the vesting of title in these existing pastoral leases held by Aboriginal people is the re-creation of a native title which has necessarily, as a result of the previous application of the law, been extinguished. If we are re-creating, in a sense, something which was previously there but has been extinguished, as a matter of caution, I guess it is appropriate to call it native title equivalent rather than native title&mdash;although that is essentially a matter of lawyers' semantics and that view may not prevail in the final drafting of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let me make the point at the outset that there is no difference between the kind of native title that we are talking about at large that might be acquired in respect of presently unalienated crown land and the kind of native title that might be acquired as a result of the conversion of these existing leases. As I said yesterday, the content of just what precisely is involved in native title will necessarily vary according to the context and the circumstances. That was made perfectly clear as early as the release of the government's discussion paper back in June&mdash;on page 15, paragraph 2.4. Senator Alston can read that for himself. I will not go through it. The notion of native title is essentially a rather flexible concept, depending on the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is the situation so far as what I am asked about&mdash;the question of inalienability? Is it inalienable or is it not? The bill will not provide for native title to be sold or leased and in that sense it will not be alienable in the same way as ordinary titles are in this country. But there will be a power&mdash;and this is set out in paragraph 29 of the legislative outline&mdash;for native titleholders to surrender their title to governments if they wish; for example, to facilitate commercial development by having a statutory title issued over part of the land. The new native title equivalent will essentially involve current rights to operate a pastoral lease plus any rights&mdash;but no more than that&mdash;which are held under the customary law of the native titleholders. It is that that introduces an element of uncertainty as to how much in the way of rights of that kind may in fact exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I make clear also for the record that the new native title will not be the same as Northern Territory inalienable freehold title which does, of course, have a right of veto over mining associated with it. It will, however, attract the right of negotiation, to be provided by the Commonwealth bill, for all native titleholders when development of their land is proposed. Native title claimants will, under the proposal, be able to apply to either the Federal Court or a recognised state tribunal to have their claims considered. Might I say this further, although Senator Alston did not ask me: the government will be giving further consideration to the possibility of legal assistance to land holders whose land is the subject of native title claim. The bill will provide for conciliation to be available to the courts in considering native title claims, thus hopefully minimising any such legal cost.</PARA>

After the mandatory waffle about flexible concepts, did I understand the minister to say that native title equivalent would not be able to be sold?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The system to which Senator Foreman referred has substantial applications in providing hydrographic information which could well assist the proposed study. With ingenuity and perseverance, Australia has produced a system that is at the leading edge of technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an Australian success story. The LADS system was developed to address an identified need for an accelerated rate of survey of Australian waters. The need was identified in the 1986 Dibb report and the 1987 white paper. The surveying is required to  meet  our  own  and  international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">LADS was designed and developed to an experimental stage by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. In 1989 BHP and Vision Systems South Australia were awarded the contract to develop the system to operational status. LADS has now been in operational service with the Royal Australian Navy since February and was formally accepted into service by the navy last month. The LADS project is an excellent example of defence and industry working together to develop a world leading technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that a number of the charts used by commercial and defence shipping today are based on charts produced by Matthew Flinders about 200 years ago. LADS has the ability to rapidly record accurate, high density and total coverage digital information of coastal waters up to 50 metres in depth. LADS is capable of surveying in excess of 50 square kilometres in an hour. This is up to 10 times faster than the present surface methods. In addition, it can provide a complete, safe coverage of complex and dangerous areas unsuitable for survey by surface vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is extremely impressive and it is no wonder that it has been drawn to the attention of the US navy. The US navy oceanographer Admiral Chesborough flew a survey sortie in the LADS aircraft out of Townsville last April. BHP has been funded by the US navy to undertake preliminary studies on a number of applications, including the fitting of LADS to some of the US navy's P3C Orions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable potential for LADS throughout the world in areas that have shallow coastal waters. For example, discussions with Indonesian coastal authorities are currently under way. Other regional countries have also expressed an interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, this system offers a variety of applications and opportunities in Australia for the production of accurate and up-to-date charts of the Great Barrier Reef, for oil and gas exploration and for the general safety of those who use Australian waters. Finally, interest can be generated overseas in what is potentially a very good export market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When considering this matter, the Senate needs to be conscious of the fact that we are talking about something which is primarily a New South Wales government and a city of Sydney responsibility to which the Commonwealth is contributing. The Commonwealth is not running the games and is not responsible for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the games relate to my portfolio responsibility of administrative services, and the extent to which the Commonwealth would be involved in any purchasing matters, the three principles that govern purchasing policy would apply in that area. They are value for money, open and effective competition and maximising opportunities for local suppliers to compete for government business. Within those principles, any purchasing which we did or over which we had control would be conducted in accordance with our normal purchasing policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be great benefits for Australian business and employment as a result of this injection of activity. I do not want to get into the argument that appears to be occurring in the New South Wales government about what the budget is or should be or who told the truth about it or who did not; I will not stray into that area. I think there will be a lot of benefits. The Commonwealth will support the games because we wish them to succeed. But we will not be controlling the games, so there will be a limited capacity&mdash;there probably should be&mdash;for us to determine what happens. But the purchasing policies of the Commonwealth, which are based on those three principles, will govern any influence that we might exercise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as the basic native title is concerned, that is correct. The coexistence means that some rights may still be perfectly capable of enjoyment. It does not necessarily mean exclusion from the land in question by the holders of the native title during the tenure of the lease, be it for exploration, production or whatever. Native title is not extinguished in the sense that it revives fully, in its full application, whatever that may be, in circumstances once the mining lease has fully expired.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>It is because the content of native title is so variable and contains so many different dimensions that it is impossible to say that it cannot be enjoyed completely during the tenure of a mining grant over native title land. It obviously cannot be enjoyed to the extent that there is a hole in a ground and ore is being dug out with appropriate roads, buildings and everything else associated with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Burns's question deals with the relationship between Australia and the rest of the Asian region. It focuses, as did the Attorney-General in his announcement of this program just a few weeks ago, on the trade opportunities, particularly legal service opportunities, between Australia and the rest of our region. As Senator Burns said, that program had its first meeting this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the program go very much to the heart of our trade opportunities, particularly legal service opportunities, within our region. One is, amongst others, to assist the process of legal modernisation in the three Indo-Chinese countries with which this program is concerned; that is, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The modernisation that we are talking about is very much related to trade and investment related law. A second objective is to promote legal cooperation between Australia and those three countries in Indo-China. A third is to advance Australia's legal expertise and experience, where appropriate, for the development of legal services, infrastructure and new laws in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important and innovative program, in that not only does it enhance trade and investment opportunities between Australia and those countries, but, more particularly, it assists Australian lawyers to understand the systems of law, values and legal traditions of those particular countries. It also picks up the trend in those countries&mdash;Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia&mdash;towards market based economies, and the need for laws to regulate an expanding private sector in those three countries and to define rights and the extent of private involvement in both investment and trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's role will be to oversee the program. In doing so, it will also help advance Australia's standing as a model for the development of these new laws and infrastructures in these three countries. This week's meeting was chaired by Ms Elizabeth Nosworthy, a leading Australian commercial lawyer. In order to reflect the diverse support for this program, other members of the committee come from the private sector, from legal academics and business sector representatives and, of course, from government and the Law Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program has funding to the tune of $670,000 over 3 1/2 years. In pursuing the objectives of the program, AILC will collaborate closely with the re-established International Legal Services Advisory Council, of which Sir Laurence Street is primary member. The committee will be concerned with identifying suitable areas for Australian legal cooperation and will recommend priorities for funding to the Attorney-General. At the same time as recommending those priorities, I think the Attorney-General expects a number of existing government programs to be amongst those to be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program is important in the continuing expansion of contacts and trade, particularly investment between Australia and Asia. It is particularly important because it goes very much to the foundation of business relationships between this country and the three countries involved. We are talking about setting up basic legal infrastructure in the three countries of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. When we talk about the need for a response in this area, we are talking about the direct interest of Australian business and, of course, those three countries which will be the subject of Australian investment and trade opportunities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks yesterday and those of the Prime Minister last night were both qualified. I said, correctly, that the compensation cost was impossible to quantify at this stage. The Prime Minister equally talked of probably a moderately sized amount, but over a long period. Those qualifications are appropriate. Nobody is in a position to make anything more than a guesstimate. The scope of those guesstimates between informed observers is bound to differ. We cannot know how many, if any, grants would be found invalid by a court. It is very difficult, as I said, to envisage any such grants being found invalid before 1975, but certainly, as the Prime Minister said, there are up to 11 in that category so far as pastoral leases are concerned between 1975 and 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether compensation will be payable in any of those cases depends on a number of factors which are necessarily unknown at this stage. Who has native title? Where? To what extent? Is the grant in question invalidated because compensation was not paid or because there was some purported procedural unfairness at the time? What amount will be appropriate for loss of native titleholders' rights, including special attachment to the land?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is entirely possible that the compensation bill will be relatively small. That remains my own view. Certainly it will be spread over a number of years. Neither I nor the Prime Minister was purporting to give definitive answers, as is perfectly clear from the context of each of our remarks. That the quantum of compensation is uncertain should come as no great revelation to the opposition or anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again referring to the discussion paper back in June, in paragraphs 8.8 to 8.13 of that paper that issue is dealt with in a clear and open and very frank way. Neither I nor the Prime Minister disagrees with the proposition that is contained here, which says that it is `impossible to make a confident estimate of the quantum of compensation payable in relation to past grants'. One's estimate would also have to depend on whether one has in mind compensation per se or the administrative and legal costs of setting up and running the institutions and processes that will be necessary to determine those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the fact that compensation&mdash;which is payable by governments, not by industries; so to that extent it ought not to be a matter of concern for the pastoralists in question&mdash;cannot be predicted with certainty is of course no reason at all to shy away from doing what is necessary to provide security for grants and just treatment of native titleholders. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are some residual areas that necessarily will remain uncertain even with the passage of this legislation&mdash;and compensation is manifestly one of those areas&mdash;undoubtedly the legislative package will create a great deal more certainty, infinitely more certainty, about the whole operation of the Mabo title exercise than would have been the case had the matter simply been left to be resolved on a case by case basis by the courts. That is why we have gone down the legislative track and that is why there is so much support for this result everywhere else in the Australian community except on the opposition benches.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth&mdash;state housing agreements for service housing were made between the 1940s and the 1970s. They were appropriate for the time but have become increasingly unsatisfactory for the provision of defence housing. The Commonwealth has been renegotiating these agreements as one of its initiatives to address the longstanding problems with the standard of defence housing. The broad proposal put to the states was for the Commonwealth and the states to share equally the ownership of the existing Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement service houses and the outstanding debt on those houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to jointly announce with the South Australian Minister for Housing, Mr Greg Crafter, last week that agreement had been reached on terms for renegotiation with South Australia. This agreement now means that the Commonwealth has successfully renegotiated Commonwealth-state housing agreements with all states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This agreement will bring many benefits to South Australia. The housing activity arising from this renegotiation will have significant economic benefits for South Australia. Over the next three years the Defence Housing Authority plans to spend around $50 million on the purchase of housing, land development and house construction in South Australia. The authority will spend substantial funds improving the houses it acquires from the state. Some of the houses are no longer suitable for defence needs. Over the next three years many will be progressively sold off but, of course, this will be done in an orderly manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Commonwealth's perspective, the renegotiation of the housing agreement has many benefits. It provides greater control over the management of defence housing, including a more responsive repairs and maintenance service to defence families. It also gives the Defence Housing Authority the flexibility to upgrade housing in the most effective manner. Ownership of the houses means that unsuitable houses can be sold to generate income for replacement dwellings. That will reduce the demand on other sources of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Renegotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is a win for both the state and the Commonwealth. Certainly from my perspective, the key outcome is that it furthers this government's aim to improve the quality of housing for all service families across Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter for the courts to determine. As I have said on numerous occasions, I think any claim based on non-Racial Discrimination Act clauses but rather on common law or fiduciary duty or rights of that kind, is highly unlikely to have much chance of success in persuading a court that the grant of the title in question was invalid for the reason that it failed to take into account these duties or common law rights of that kind.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that realistically&mdash;and the Prime Minister hinted as much last night&mdash;the only claims that are likely to give rise to even the possibility of compensation are those relating to 1975 to 1993 pastoral leases, of which there is a maximum of just 11. There is even a question mark as to how many of them are properly to be regarded as newly granted leases as distinct from renewals or having some element of continuity. It is probably only in relation to those that some sort of prima facie claim could be made based on the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. Equally again, it is extremely unclear as to whether or not, as I said in answer to a previous question, the High Court would regard in these situations the Racial Discrimination Act as going as far as invalidating the grant in question made during that period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am saying is it is perfectly possible to contemplate a situation where a group of Aboriginal people who can establish a longstanding connection with a particular piece of land in question might be able to persuade a court that they did in fact have native title, as it were, to that particular land. But the problem is that that particular native title would have been extinguished in whole or to the extent of its inconsistency with the grant in question by virtue of that other grant having been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is a matter of perhaps people being able to establish a prima facie claim to native title based on all those connections, but to be faced with the situation of it being extinguished. The only right that they would be able to assert under those circumstances would be to argue to a court that the grant that was made over their land purporting to extinguish it was, in fact, invalid because of the Racial Discrimination Act, some principle fiduciary duty or whatever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in relation to that point that I was saying that I do not think most lawyers&mdash;and I think most Aboriginal lawyers equally accept the validity of this&mdash;would think that there is very much substance to any such claim.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Woodley says the terms of reference of the inquiry are very wide because my advice is that the terms of reference have not been finalised yet. That is advice that I received only briefly, but, so far as I know, that is the case. There are ministerial consultations under way about what those terms of reference will be, so I cannot give any guarantees about that until at least the terms of reference are finalised and after that we will have to see what happens with the inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate that there has been considerable interest in this inquiry. I fully expect that the commission will have a very wide range of views put to it in submissions and public presentations. Honourable senators would know that the commission advertises each inquiry and draws up a list of prospective participants. My understanding is that a large list of individuals and organisations have expressed interest in the inquiry. In fact, some charities have welcomed the inquiry and have expressed their strong desire to put their views to this independent review. It is the independence of the review process that is, in this instance, seen to be the case for it to be conducted by the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charity sector of our society and economy receives a large amount of government assistance. It is entirely appropriate that from time to time there should be an independent review about how that money is being spent. The inquiry is likely to explore options for maximising the benefits to be gained from such assistance. For example, it may well lead to enabling a government to provide greater assistance without increases in outlays. It is also important that this inquiry may possibly inform the general public about the direction and effectiveness of their donations to charities and encourage more support. That responds to the second point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to questions without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill), the Leader of the National Party in the Senate (Senator Boswell) and Senators Alston, Crane, Ellison, Reynolds and Tambling this day relating to native title.</PARA>
<PARA>Today we have seen an absolutely appalling display of ignorance&mdash;whether calculated or otherwise is hard to tell. I think the high watermark of it was when Senator Gareth Evans was asked whether he was aware that on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had actually mentioned hundreds of millions of dollars. Of course, he was at great pains to suggest that he had been watching it and, therefore, presumably, he had a word perfect recollection of all that was said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that he was asked in an earlier question about the concept of pastoral leases and whether they absolutely extinguished native title. He said that this is a matter for determination by the High Court and that there are two possible options, one being that it does extinguish it permanently and the other being that it does it only to the extent of the inconsistency. He clearly did not even hear last night the following comments of Mr Keating to Paul Lyneham:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well what I said to the Aboriginal people I negotiated with last week, look, I will take to Cabinet the notion that, there are two notions, that a pastoral lease extinguishes Native Title absolutely, or a pastoral lease extinguishes Native Title to the extent that it is inconsistent with Native Title. That's what they asked me to take to Cabinet. This did introduce for some pastoralists some uncertainty, although, in fact the primacy of their lease was 100 per cent protected. But to remove it, the Aboriginal people made a judgment, really how much is in this for us, how many of these thin sliver of rights, of uncertain rights, would we actually get? And given that the Government then last night gave them a different offer to turn many pastoral leases owned by them into a form of Native Title . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what the Prime Minister was confirming was that the Aboriginal negotiators had clearly chosen not to have the question left open. In other words, the government had made a decision to go down the former path, that pastoral leases extinguish native title absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we have this minister coming in here and rabbiting on, completely oblivious to all that was said by his Prime Minister last night. All I can think of is that, since that time, he has been far too busy on the phone, probably ringing his buddy, Ali Alatas, the foreign minister of Indonesia, or his good friend Yasser Arafat, to check on latest developments in the Middle East, or perhaps his old mate Boutros Boutros-Ghali, or even Warren Christopher&mdash;or whoever else one calls if one wants to make sure that one's job application for Secretary-General to the UN is being properly processed, or perhaps simply to find out how one gets one's deposit back on a failed application for a Nobel Peace Prize. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that what we got was an appalling litany of inconsistencies from this minister. I refer in particular to the answer that he gave me. If ever there was an example of waffle, this is it. He was asked whether or not one can sell  if it is native title equivalent. His answer&mdash;this is classic talk&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bigglespeak, that will do. He answered:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are recreating, in a sense, something which was previously there but has been extinguished, as a matter of caution, I guess it is appropriate to call it native title equivalent rather than native title&mdash;although that is essentially a matter of lawyer's semantics and that view may not prevail in the final drafting of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he has no idea what the government's current position is in relation to that, although later on he said what will be spelt out in the legislation. Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the content of just what precisely is involved in native title will necessarily vary according to the context and the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, classic waffle. The point is whether or not it is inalienable. What he said was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there will be a power . . . for native titleholders to surrender their title to governments if they wish; for example, to facilitate commercial development. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, that means that, if they want to flog the land, they surrender the title to the government, the government reissues the title to those purchasers and the purchasers hand over the money to the native titleholders. In other words, they have sold the land&mdash;whether or not the minister technically describes it in that way. Then he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new native title equivalent will essentially involve current rights to operate a pastoral lease plus any rights&mdash;but no more than that&mdash;which are held under the customary law of the native titleholders.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, under customary law for native titleholders, they cannot alienate it. They cannot surrender it to the Commonwealth and pass it on and get their money through the back door. In other words, they cannot sell it commercially. Clearly, therefore, if we are being told, on the one hand, that it is inalienable and they cannot sell it why, on the other hand, were we being told by the Prime Minister that they  can?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional funding will be provided to prescribed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist native title holders in the making of claims.</PARA>
<PARA>The next point she made was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will contain provision for a national land acquisition and management fund, especially to meet the land needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples who are unable to benefit from the Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA>That refers to those who live in places where they are unable to claim. If we marry that with point 7&mdash;and no-one has told me that I am wrong on point 7; certainly, Senator Evans did not answer it&mdash;any claim is open, since 1788, and it is uncapped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Ms O'Donoghue put out this statement? Is she looking through rose-coloured glasses or has she read more into the legislation than has the Prime Minister? After all, the legislation is right in front of us. There has to be a reason why the head of ATSIC puts out a statement like that. All the questions answered today have not mentioned anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans mentioned earlier how good this government is for coming up with this situation. He claimed that it had been praised by the mining industry, Aboriginals, church groups and the like, but Lauchlan McIntosh of the mining industry certainly did not confirm what was said. Furthermore, I doubt whether the farming industry agreed with what the minister read into the statement. Certainly the major group of people that this government did not confer with was the taxpayers. The open-ended system for claims was not mentioned in the last election campaign. I do not know whether it will be $10 billion, $20 billion or $30 billion, but this government has opened up a bankcard without any limit. Senator Collins can giggle as much as he wants, but that is a fact. There is no cap. If Ms O'Donoghue is wrong in saying that there is no cap, why does Senator Gareth Evans or someone else not say so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point in the paper says that where pastoral leases have been acquired or are acquired by Aboriginal people, under the legislation the Aboriginal lessees will be able to convert pastoral leases into native title where it can be shown that native title would have existed but for the lease. That is the agenda of this government and it is the agenda of a lot of people to wipe out the Kimberleys in WA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins can giggle as much as he likes, but the point is that a lot of stations are being bought out with ATSIC money, which is taxpayers' money. Under this system the land can then be converted to native title and the pastoral industry will be extinguished from that place forever. That is part of the agenda of this government, and the previous defeated, disgraced Labor government of Western Australia had the same idea. If this proposed legislation sees the light of day, it will let that happen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion moved by Senator Alston. It is quite clear from the answers that Senator Gareth Evans gave in this chamber today that the government is asking the Australian taxpayer, the pastoral industry and the mining industry to sign a blank cheque with its proposed Mabo legislation. The government will not show us the legislation. We are being told all sorts of things about it. We are told that it will solve everything from native title problems to a headache. But we are not seeing any clear indication from this government as to the limits of native title or exactly what will be protected or validated and what will not be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reply to a question from Senator Boswell today, Senator Evans said quite clearly that in northern Queensland and northern Australia Aboriginals are still living on pastoral properties that they have always lived on, and in many cases they are the stock hands or live in the nearby town. They have not lost their link with the land. The pastoralists who hold a lease are not protected by virtue of the validation that will be given to the supposedly 11 leases that have a Racial Discrimination Act problem. They are still open to a common law claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question asked today in question time was: what will be the cost in compensation or what will be the effect on the pastoralists? Senator Evans said, `I can't tell you what the cost will be because we don't know'. Yet the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has been running around saying, `This solves these problems once and for all. This is an historic piece of legislation'. When we ask his minister in this place what will be the consequences of the legislation, how much it will cost us and who is affected, he says, `I don't know'. That is the answer to every question that is put to the minister. It is dreadfully true and I wish it were not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans was asked by Senator Tambling this afternoon what would be the effect of the conversion by Aboriginal groups of pastoral leases to native title land.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for the government is that as soon as these pastoral leases get converted to native title, no commercial lender will lend to them because a mortgage over that title would be thoroughly and utterly useless because native title can never be sold. So a mortgagee who takes a mortgage will get absolutely nothing. Nobody will lend to that person. Any necessity for working capital must be met by the taxpayer or directly by the native titleholders. We are talking about people who do not have a lot of money to put together&mdash;that is the whole basis of the government saying it needs some sort of social justice package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So who will fork out for the bill? It will be the taxpayer again. When asked how much it would cost, what answer did we get from Senator Evans? He said, `We don't know. We will have to look. We will have to see what the courts say. It will have to be done on a case by case basis'. He did anything but give a straight answer. The straight answer is that this proposed package of legislation has solved nothing. The government cannot answer any of these burning questions in relation to exactly what will be validated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans sits opposite and shakes his head. He well knows the truth, which is that the Australian public, the pastoral industry, the mining industry and governments, state and federal, are being asked to sign a blank cheque.

I invite Senator Reynolds to go back and read those writings. She should be aware that those writings are being widely read in the community and that that accounts for a high degree of nervousness about this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly appropriate for us to ask certain questions about really fundamental changes in the laws relating to titles in this country. That is the clear role of an opposition. As the government is bringing in legislation to make a fundamental change, I would have thought it not unfair to ask Senator Evans what proportion of the Australian land mass, in the government's assessment, will come under native title. Certainly, that can be answered only on the basis of an estimate. Mr Keating went over to Western Australia and said that he believed some 80 per cent of crown land in Western Australia&mdash;a vast amount of this nation&mdash;could become subject to native title claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that to be a perfectly fair question. I would have thought this was a perfectly fair question to ask a government which wanted to be honest and frank with the people&mdash;and I know that asking a Labor government to be honest and frank with the Australian people may be asking too much; certainly there is not much precedence for that. We have pressed that question with Senator Evans and we have received no answer whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians are taxpayers. Everyone concedes that compensation is going to be paid. The question is, of course, how much compensation. Is it going to be a matter of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars. The taxpayers of Australia are interested in that sort of question. This matter cannot be swept aside in the way that Senator Evans and Mr Keating have been trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these questions are asked of Labor ministers, we get the sort of reaction that we got from Senator Evans and Senator Ray yesterday when they called us rednecks. In the old days, rednecks were all Labor voters. Their necks were burnt because they were labouring hard in the fields and the mines. Members of the Labor Party used to respect that sort of person. But the modern Labor Party, full of the tertiary educated people of this world, simply does not care about those people, even though they are the people who will have to be taxed so that compensation can be paid. If the government does not want to ask that question in its party room, the opposition wants to ask it in this chamber because these people will be asked to pay the compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to Senator Evans that it is time the government was far more frank about this particular issue and made very clear the amount of land mass involved and the compensation paid. One only has to read the editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> to see the great uncertainties. The heading of the editorial is `Mabo deal still leaves uncertainty'. Senator Kernot, who has just voted to increase taxes on all Australian people, allows a budget to go through which will increase taxes on all Australians. I thought Senator Kernot would have been worried about mining developments in Queensland which will help to provide jobs and the compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one reads these editorials, one finds that, as a result of the statements by the Prime Minister, there is very great uncertainty as to whether major mining developments can be held up in this country and will ultimately not go ahead.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that we were faced with both an opportunity and a problem by the Mabo case. When the High Court brought down the Mabo case, we were faced with a marvellous opportunity for the first time in the country's history to achieve a genuine reconciliation with white Australians and black Australians. We were confronted with the opportunity for the first time in our history to redress a fundamental and 200-year-old wrong; that is, the principle of terra nullius.

We sought to reduce that uncertainty&mdash;not to get rid of it completely. That is impossible because there are too many unknowns still at the edges, in particular on the question of compensation, for all the reasons I spelt out fully, precisely and frankly when I spoke in question time. There are elements of residual uncertainty which simply are not capable of being resolved by anybody until they are dealt with on case by case basis. That is always the case with compensation issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Employment, Education and Training has presented a report to the Senate today on the data-matching program which the government has instituted in connection with a number of other departments to improve the level of public confidence in the department and the government's capacity to detect and deter fraudulent behaviour. There was enormous growth in computer-based record systems in 1980s. The perceived level of fraud has allowed some sections of the community to argue that government benefits are being directed to places where they should not be. This report indicates that the department has the capacity to recognise fraudulent behaviour and to identify means by which it can be detected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Interestingly enough, this scheme also has the capacity to identify where payments have not been made. That is where people have not been getting moneys that they are entitled to and as a consequence the necessary adjustments have to be made. This program has meant that individual departments have had enormous power to detect incorrect payments, but the various secrecy provisions in legislation up until 1990 restricted information flow between departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990-91 budget rectified this situation and enacted the Data-Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. The measures introduced in this legislation included the requirement for most people claiming government assistance to provide tax file numbers as a prerequisite for payment and increased computerised matching of data held by various government agencies. The first data exchange occurred in April 1991. The five government agencies involved were the Australian Taxation Office, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the executive summary of this report indicates, the data-matching program has provided DEET with an effective tool in identifying and stopping fraudulent activity. The department has been able to demonstrate that for an investment of $1.2 million, it has saved just under $1 million and identified a further $6.6 million in debts. The executive summary goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department expects to recover $5 million of this debt over the next 3 years. There is also a significant but unmeasured deterrent to fraud as a result of the Data-matching Program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These substantial savings and debts attest to the success of the Data-matching Program and such results are certain to continue should the program be extended beyond January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>The whole range of government agencies that this could apply to has meant there has been identification of discrepancies between various measures undertaken and the accuracy of information provided. Therefore, measures have to be taken to protect personal identity. The data involved with the Taxation Office has to be checked against the validity of data actually provided. This has serious privacy implications, and the Privacy Commissioner has had to be involved in regular audits of all the issues raised through this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This data-matching program clearly demonstrates that DEET is prepared to go to elaborate lengths to successfully protect and stop fraud and, under the watchful eye of the Privacy Commissioner, to examine carefully the information supplied to the individual. However, we cannot say that the same parallel applies when it comes to the department's capacity to enforce agreements to systems. On the one hand, enormous lengths are taken to enforce agreements with individuals; but when it comes to the payment of very large sums of money to states, the same level of attention is not paid to enforcement. The same level of attention is not paid to the capacity of state governments to implement agreements that they have entered into with the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we saw recently in Auditor-General's report No. 6 of 1993-94, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An audit commentary on aspects of the Commonwealth-state agreements</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in this parliament, the adequacy of current measures is very questionable indeed. In many cases funds allocated to states have not met the agreements entered into with the Commonwealth. Increasingly, particularly in Victoria, grave concern is being expressed about the level of funding that is going to national equity programs and is not being spent in accordance with the agreements entered into. The whole question of substitution arises in this regard whereby moneys which are provided to the states, and which are supposed to supplement moneys paid by the states for various educational programs, are not being spent effectively in accordance with agreements. There has been a case where Commonwealth moneys are replacing state moneys. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was indicated in those remarks at the time of that minority report coming before this chamber that this action would be resisted, it would fail and it was flawed both legally and politically.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not appropriate, under the principles of the parliamentary system in which we function, in terms of principles of comity, that there should be a mechanism whereby a member of parliament from one house can be dragged before a parliament in another jurisdiction.

But if we do accept that notion, it would be appropriate, I suppose, if we followed the precedent that would be set, that members of this chamber could be dragged before the state chambers at some future point.

Senator Carr simply cannot draw that conclusion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the second reading motion. The issues have been canvassed at length in this place and we do not want to unnecessarily take the time of the Senate. There are, however, a few points that should be made. The bills have come back to us, of course, in a different form from that in which they left us a week or so ago. They were then linked with the wholesale sales tax increases, and they have now been separated and changes have been made to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the government's handling of this matter has been nothing short of disgraceful. A week or so ago in this place, the Senate passed a resolution opposing the increase in sales tax on wine&mdash;and it did so for very good reasons. This in many ways is a fledgling Australian industry, but one with enormous potential as an export industry and with potential to provide jobs in Australia&mdash;jobs in an environment, I remind honourable senators, in which we still have nearly a million Australians out of work. It is a good industry; it is a high value added industry; it takes the best of our natural produce and the skills of our producers and creates wealth&mdash;and with it, as I said, jobs and all the social benefits that obviously flow from being able to employ more of our people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's attitude to this industry with such wonderful potential was: `Here is an opportunity for us to rip more revenue out of this youthful enterprise'. This was to meet the embarrassment that has really been caused as a result of the lies that went back before the last election. There was no consideration of the consequences to this industry. There was no willingness on the part of the government to listen to industry representatives on what would be the consequence of its intended taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is a debate that we have had and I remind you, Mr Deputy President, that this Senate was clear in its majority view that the new tax should not be imposed. The bill therefore went back to the House of Representatives with our message to that effect. It is what occurred after that that is so disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, what happened was that the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins&mdash;Treasurer for the time being, it would seem&mdash;blackmailed the industry, with the support of this government. Together they held a gun at the head of the industry&mdash;in fact, a double-barrelled gun&mdash;and they were not concerned about the consequences of what they were doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, they said to the industry, `Unless you are prepared to compromise, take what you know is not in the best interests of your industry, we will impose an excise'&mdash;with all the destructive effect that that would have on the industry&mdash;`and we can impose it without it having to go through the parliament for a year. So we are prepared to put your industry at such risk for a year simply in order to pressure you to our position'. It was nothing short of political blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, they said to the industry&mdash;the second barrel of their gun&mdash;`We do not care how long this process takes', knowing full well that the uncertainty was causing great damage to the industry in the marketplace. As everyone knows, the uncertainty has had a detrimental effect on sales. That was the second threat that they held over the industry&mdash;`We do not care how long it takes; we will bring you to heel. We do not care what the consequence will be to the industry. We do not care what the consequence will be to employment. That is not our interest. We are going to beat you whether you like it or not'. It was political blackmail of the worst type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, in the end the industry&mdash;and when I say `the industry' I mean at least some of the industry leaders&mdash;had no alternative but to capitulate and to say that it would accept what has been described as a compromise, even though it knows that it could have a destructive effect upon this vitally important and growing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those industry leaders were forced to accept this deal, knowing that it was not in the best interests of their industry, because the government threatened them that, if they did not, they would have this excise imposed without the opportunity of parliamentary scrutiny for a year and, furthermore, that the industry would be all but destroyed in the meantime by the uncertainty of the situation that was continuing. It is appalling behaviour by a government to simply try to win a political point. </PARA>

Therefore, we will stand by our position, which was right in principle from day one, that we will oppose this taxation, which is not in the interest of the industry in the narrow term and the national interest in the wider term. We announced immediately after the budget that we would oppose this tax. We were opposed to it then and we remain opposed to it now, even in its so-called compromised form. </PARA>

We deplore the fact that the industry has been forced to its knees by the intolerable behaviour of this government. We are not going to be a party to it.

There is a proposal that this matter be dealt with later in the day. We are honouring commitments we made about the order of business. The only surprise in any of this matter was that Senator Hill continued with a speech on the second reading, which I am entirely relaxed about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the whip for the opposition, I wish to make a point of explanation. Senator Faulkner is not quite correct in his belief that there was an understanding reached this morning that we would postpone this debate until a later hour this day. The arrangement was that we would see, when it came on, but that it was expected to be introduced after government business order of the day No.4, Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.1) and Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No.2). That was based on the assumption that the bills were going to be introduced after either item No. 2 or item No. 3. That did not occur, because the government did not have the bills ready to bring into the chamber, for some reason or other which we are not privy to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, it was the very clear intention, as far as I understand it, that we proceed immediately to the second reading consideration of these bills, which is what Senator Hill has done. Certainly, that is the understanding on our side. It was always intended that these bills receive the second reading consideration before the committee stage of government business order of the day No. 5, the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are quite surprised, as are other honourable senators in this chamber who wish to make a contribution on these bills. I note that Senator Margetts is in the chamber. I know that Senator Ellison, Senator Watson, Senator Ferguson and Senator Campbell also wish to make a contribution to the second reading debate and are here on the basis that it will proceed forthwith. I believe that the real reason why the government wishes to adjourn this is that it wants to rectify the problem it had in committee before lunch. I will not say anything more about it, but it certainly is not correct to say that there was an understanding that the debate would automatically be postponed until a later hour this day. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 focuses on implementing some 1993 Federal Election initiatives and initiatives announced in the 1993 Budget. The Bill also provides for some minor policy changes and technical amendments to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of social security administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to the 1993 Federal Election, the Government announced that it would introduce new payment arrangements for long term unemployed clients aged 60 and over, but below pension age. The commitment was made in recognition of the difficulties faced by older unemployed people in the current labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 20 March 1994, any person aged 60 and over but who has not reached pension age, is unemployed, has been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service for the last 12 months and who has been receiving income support payments for the last 12 months will be able to claim a Mature Age Allowance. The person will have to be in Australia and satisfy the age pension residency requirement of 10 years qualifying Australian residence. The person's partner might also be qualified to receive a Mature Age Partner Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transfer to the new Allowance will be voluntary. Unlike the conditions that apply to Newstart Allowance, a person being paid the Mature Age Allowance will not have to satisfy an activity test nor stay registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. However, a person might wish to remain registered so as to use any assistance the Commonwealth Employment Service provides. Mature Age Allowance will be paid at age pension rates and subject to the pension income and assets tests. Some of the other main features of the new Allowance are that allowees will have access to the pensioner earnings credit scheme and pensioner tax rebates will also apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that the need for the Mature Age Allowance could diminish when the economy recovers. To that end, legislation providing for the Allowance will be subject to a sunset clause of 30 June 1996 after which time no new claims may be lodged. Existing recipients will not be affected. Continuation of the arrangements will be reviewed in 1994-95 in the light of prevailing labour market conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also gives effect to an election commitment announced by the Prime Minister in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS> to provide an incentive for social security allowance recipients and their partners to earn moderate casual or part-time income without automatically affecting their income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Job Search, Newstart and Sickness Allowance clients being paid at the maximum rate will be able to build up credit of up to $500 that can be offset against income from employment. Couples will be able to build up a maximum credit of $500 each. For a single person, credit will accrue at the rate of $90 a fortnight. Credit for each member of a couple will accrue at $80 a fortnight. The credits will not be transferable between partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Credits may be used provided the person's earnings from employment and other income fall below the income test cut-out point for that person for the fortnight in question. For those earning above the cut-out points in a given fortnight, credits may not be accessed but will be "preserved" for up to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13 weeks and can be accessed at a later time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Newstart Allowance was introduced in July 1991 with the objective of assisting the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed and those with labour market disadvantages, to return to paid employment and so reduce their dependency on income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A requirement of Newstart's implementation was that an interim evaluation report be presented in the 1993-94 Budget context. The report indicated that Newstart has produced some impressive results, including 1.7 million job referrals, over 430,000 placements on labour market programs and 320,000 job placements. As part of the interim evaluation, a post implementation review was conducted. In general, the review found that both staff and clients see Newstart as an improvement on the old arrangements, but officers of the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service felt that the positive aspects could be better used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures to be implemented progressively from September 1993 to September 1994, will reinforce the key objective of the Newstart strategy, namely, to help those on social security payments to maintain their job search efforts and move into jobs. In summary, those measures will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">improve the selection processes for client contacts to ensure the early identification and assessment of clients with labour market disadvantages;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide more effective case management for all Newstart clients, particularly those with a labour market disadvantage;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enhance compliance and review activity to reinforce client obligations to make genuine efforts to find work, undertake training and generally improve job prospects;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">improve client assistance and service delivery; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">improve liaison between the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of some of these measures requires legislation and the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 provides the first step in doing this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 provides for the introduction from 1 January 1994 of a $200 Education Entry Payment for Newstart Allowance clients and Job Search Allowance clients under 18 who have been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service as unemployed for at least 12 months and who enrol in a full-time course of education that is an approved course under the AUSTUDY or ABSTUDY schemes. The payment will assist with the up-front costs of taking up study, such as enrolment fees, purchasing books, student union fees and course fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people, such as those who have lived or worked overseas, may be entitled to income support from another country. Presently, it is not a general requirement for the grant or continued payment of an Australian pension that people claim or pursue their entitlement from another country, even from countries with which Australia has social security agreements based on shared responsibility. From 20 March 1994, if the Secretary to the Department of Social Security thinks a person or their partner would be entitled to a payment from a specified country, it will be necessary for the person or their partner to take reasonable steps to obtain the maximum payment from that country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall result will be a reduced dependence on Australian social security pensions when payments are also available from specified countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned to ensure that the debt recovery provisions set out in the Social Security Act 1991 operate not only efficiently and effectively but with fairness. With those objectives in mind, the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 will amend the Social Security Act 1991 from 1 January 1994 to implement a number of initiatives announced in the 1993 Budget relating to debt recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance and Sickness Allowance clients are paid according to the number of days for which they are entitled to payment. If a client does not tell the Department they have started work or received income, any calculation of overpayment begins from the day after this `notifiable event' occurred. Amendments will provide for the calculation of the overpayment to start on the day the notifiable event occurs, rather than the day after and will bring the treatment of overpayments into line with the payment of arrears.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dual payments, for example, where a client obtains a replacement cheque (on the basis that the original cheque has not been received) but subsequently obtains value for not only the replacement cheque but also the original, will be recoverable in the same way as many other debts, for example, from continuing payments or by garnishee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recovery of debts arising from fraudulent negotiation of cheques by a third party will be streamlined  by allowing recovery using existing powers under the Social Security Act 1991. This will avoid the need for costly civil action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act 1991 generally excludes dual entitlement to social security income support and other government income support payments such as compensation and service pension. However, unless a client commits a breach of a provision of the Act or misrepresents their situation, a debt arises only where there are dual social security payments or concurrent payments of a social security payment and a service pension. Amendments will extend the debt recovery provisions to allow recovery of all payments covered by multiple entitlement exclusion provisions, such as AUSTUDY and war widows pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, fraudulently obtained payments can only be recovered from the Department of Social Security client who actually received them unless another Departmental client agrees to recovery from their own payment. The Department of Social Security has been criticised by the Courts in a number of cases&mdash;specifically, for not taking action against partners who were knowingly involved in payments being fraudulently obtained by Department of Social Security clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will allow a debt to be recovered from another person, usually a partner, where that person has benefited from and been knowingly involved in the fraudulent obtaining of monies by the Department of Social Security client, provided that the involvement of the other person has first been established through criminal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for a number of measures concerning the treatment of compensation payments for social security purposes. They are intended, generally, to preserve the integrity and effectiveness of the existing provisions. One of the more significant measures will be to bring within the provisions, lump sum compensation payments whether or not they contain an economic loss component. A great majority of lump sum compensation payments contain economic loss amounts. Those payments are, and will continue to be, covered by the compensation provisions. The so-called 50% rule will remain whereby half the total lump sum will continue to be disregarded for social security entitlement purposes. It is clear, however, that compensation settlements are being entered into such that they avoid, or attempt to avoid, the compensation provisions. The Government has acted and will continue to act to ensure that people who receive compensation payments use them for their support, at least for a reasonable period of time, before calling on the taxpayer funded social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important change is to use a new divisor within the statutory formula that deals with the treatment of lump sums. The employees (all persons) Average Weekly Earnings figure is to replace the "all male" figure. The all persons figure is more likely to reflect the level of ordinary wages in the occupational classifications most likely to sustain work related injuries and recognises the fact of women's participation in the workforce and the incidence of motor vehicle accidents across the general population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another change will limit the exemption from the provisions dealing with personal sickness and accident insurance policies. Some of these policies pay policy holders an amount less an amount of income support received from the Department of Social Security in the period covered by the policy. It is not acceptable that insurance companies should be able to shift part of their costs in this way onto the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also, among other things, standardises the treatment of wife pensioners in compensation cases, clarifies the `event' that might give rise to the entitlement to compensation and tackles certain cost-shifting type provisions in State and Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rent assistance waiting periods were abolished from March 1992 for nearly all eligible clients. However, at present, young people under 18 who have lodged a claim and are qualified for the homeless or independent rates of Job Search Allowance and Sickness Allowance must serve a waiting period of 18 weeks before rent assistance is payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to abolish the 18 week waiting period for this latter group from 20 March 1994. This measure will make it easier for these young people to access secure accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has decided that from 1 January 1994 all secondary school students born after 31 December 1977, apart from those students who attract AUSTUDY paid at the independent or away from home rate or who are homeless, will instead remain within the social security system until they turn 17. Most students will become eligible to attract Family Payment at the new rate that will apply from 1 January 1994 of $123.90 a fortnight for their care giver. Those secondary school students who are homeless will be eligible for Special Benefit. On their 17th birthday, secondary school students will be able to claim AUSTUDY. This Bill gives effect to that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Social Security issues millions of statutory notices each year to various groups of clients. Most of the notices require clients to notify certain relevant changes to their circumstances and an overpayment results if a client fails to do so. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal (the SSAT) has indicated what it regards as potential technical deficiencies in the Department's notices with the result that the SSAT has found against the Department in many overpayment cases on the grounds that the notices are deficient. Given that the cost implications for the Commonwealth are significant, probably in excess of $50 million per year, it is proposed that prompt legislative action be taken to resolve this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments contained in the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 make it clear that a notice will not be invalid merely because it may fail to specify the manner in which a person must comply with it or because it does not describe itself as a `recipient notification notice' or `recipient statement notice'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to protecting the revenue, these amendments are important as a matter of equity. Many people responded to these notices and gave the Department information that brought about a reduction in their social security payments. Others ignored the notices and failed to notify the Department of named events or changes in circumstances. It would be unfair to those who did comply with the notices to relieve others from the consequences of their failure to notify.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1991, the powers of the Secretary to the Department of Social Security to waive a debt have been guided by Ministerial Direction in two successive disallowable instruments tabled in and allowed by the Parliament. Only very recently, the Federal Court decided in Riddell v Secretary to the Department of Social Security to set aside the 1991 Ministerial Direction on the grounds that it was invalid and indicated that it would do the same to the 1992 Direction if it came before the Court. This has left decision makers and Tribunals with no guidelines on how to decide if a debt may be waived and, potentially, has significant cost implications for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill addresses these problems by amending the Social Security Act 1991 to include the grounds for waiver in the Act itself. One of the grounds in the Act will be more generous than previously. Waiver of a debt will occur where the debt arises solely because of administrative error of the Commonwealth and the money was received in good faith. Previously, it was also necessary that recovery would cause financial hardship before waiver could occur. On the other hand, there will now be no general power to waive because of special circumstances. The circumstances listed in the Bill provide a code for making waiver decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 provides for data-matching between specified agencies so as to detect where two inconsistent payments are made to a person by the same or more than one agency, to detect where inconsistent income data is held about one person by two or more agencies and to detect possible tax evasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ideas for changes or improvements to the Act are constantly being made as a result of the unusually large number of agencies with a direct interest in the Act and the level of scrutiny given by parliamentarians and others. As a result, the Act has been amended on several occasions since its enactment in 1990. The Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 makes further changes to the Act to improve the efficiency and accuracy of data-matching by, among other things, permitting tax file numbers to be used by assistance agencies in discussions with the Australian Taxation Office when following up discrepancies, better clarifying certain definitions and the source of authority for payments of Commonwealth assistance and correcting some minor oversights. However, the most significant change will be to repeal the sunset provision in the Act so as to permit the data-matching program to continue beyond 22 January 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 (the ESOS Act) to strengthen the protection afforded international students' pre-paid fees. The need for this was highlighted by the closure of the Australian Business College in Perth in February 1993. This closure and the absence of money from the special account meant that about 350 overseas students in Australia and up to 100 still off-shore lost moneys totalling up to $2.2 million. Because of the special circumstances of the closure, this loss was made good by a special Commonwealth appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth should not be placed in this situation again. The industry itself must look after its own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation is also required in the current sittings to address the act's 1 January 1994 sunset clause. There is now little medium term prospect of industry self-regulation or of state and territory regulation replacing Commonwealth regulation. Industry supports continuation of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will strengthen the ESOS act by requiring private education providers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) to maintain trust accounts (not just special accounts) for students' pre-paid funds;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) to adhere to limits on draw downs from those trust accounts to ensure that if they default there is enough for refunds;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) to adhere to more prescriptive refund provisions if they fail to provide the course, or if a student withdraws from the course; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) to be in an industry-run Tuition Assurance Scheme to guarantee that international students receive the courses paid for if a provider defaults.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the Tuition Assurance Scheme are being developed by a government/industry working group. They will be prescribed in the regulations under the act later this year. The scheme will be run and funded by the industry, although $3.1 million was appropriated in the 1993 Budget to provide Commonwealth financial assistance in its establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another major amendment will introduce prison penalties for current monetary penalties for certain breaches of the act. This follows from advice from authorities investigating the closure of the Australian Business College in Perth that penalties needed to be stiffened. Increasing the penalties to imprisonment allows the court to impose a monetary penalty in addition to, or instead of, the term of imprisonment in accordance with the formula provided in the Crimes Act 1914.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional amendments include: Allowing more flexibility in rolling back the financial regulation sections of the Act in favour of equivalent state and territory arrangements: Providing a sanction when a suspended provider ignores the act's requirement that it not recruit new overseas students: Changing the definition of an `overseas student' so that it clearly excludes those studying on a visitor's visa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is the product of extensive consultation with the international education industry, including seminars in major capital cities and discussions with the National Consultative Committee on International Education and Training Services. It has also been shaped by the attentions of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, especially the committee's December 1992 report on its Inquiry into the Operation of  the ESOS Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This place has been puzzling this afternoon, I must say. Firstly, for weeks the government has been saying to us that we are delaying its tax measures and it brings the wine tax bill in here today and then wants to adjourn it. It even went to a division to have it adjourned rather than debated and disposed of in this place. The way this government carries on its business is very puzzling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we find a government in such shambles this morning that it could not even raise its numbers on a vote so critical as a vote on these tax bills. It is interesting and fortuitous in some ways that it was on this particular issue that the government failed to rustle up the numbers because this issue was the test band which the government acknowledged was likely to be unconstitutional. Yet it wants the parliament to deal with something that is probably in an invalid form and wrong in principle. It deserved to lose the vote that it lost immediately before lunch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyway, the government has now said that it erred in its counting or in rustling its people and has sought leave to put my request to the vote again. We will grant leave, firstly, because we are a generous lot and, secondly, because we know that if we do not, it will go back to the House of Representatives and then come back here and that simply wastes time. It is this side of the chamber that is seeking to deal expeditiously with the government's taxation program, not the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other interesting thing is that when this vote is put this time we will be able to find out what the Greens do. Do the Greens agree that the government should bring to the parliament a bill which the government acknowledges is probably in an unconstitutional form in order that there might be a High Court test? Who will pay for that High Court test? Why is that necessary when it is so easy for the government to put this bill in a clearly unambiguously constitutional form? This amendment requests the government to split the bill into two parts so that the constitutional ambiguity is removed and so there can be no doubt. Is it not reasonable to expect that of the government? I would have thought so. If the Greens are going to vote against it, I would like to hear their explanation for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this bill is passed in this form a lot of money and time will be wasted and industry and processes of government will be disrupted, all because of a churlish Treasurer who was not prepared to acknowledge that he made a mistake in the first instance in relation to his omnibus bill and put it right when it came back to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the opportunity to see this vote again, in particular, to see what the Greens do and to see whether on this occasion Senator Faulkner has been able to count correctly and get his people in here for a vote that I would have thought he would regard as of critical importance, but obviously did not think so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to give that explanation. It was a problem, quite frankly, concerning the President of the Senate, who normally has a pair at this time on Wednesday mornings to enable him to consult with the Speaker of the House of Representatives on a regular basis. Normally the pairing arrangement is organised as a matter of routine to allow that to occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning, as honourable senators may be aware, there were some distractions involving the Speaker in the other place. The meeting did not take place. The pairing arrangement was not formally put in place by the staff members concerned as a consequence of the meeting not going ahead. The President, quite frankly, was five seconds away from the chamber and could have come in here but he believed he was paired and it was inappropriate for him to do so. That is how the mistake arose. It is just one of those things that happens from time to time in the best managed governments and in the best managed oppositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to Senator Hill for giving leave, hopefully on behalf of the opposition and others in this chamber. We are indebted to him, if not for the graciousness with which he did it. I suppose if I were him I would have taken the opportunity to give us a flick too, which he has done. The main thing is that the explanation has been given. That was the circumstance. It is one of those things that happens from time to time and I am grateful that we can save further time by enabling this vote now to be put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reiterate one fact, and Senator Gareth Evans's last statement has jogged my memory. He said that we do not want to waste any more time on this. I agree and that is why I am voting for the opposition's motion to split the bill. There will be a lot of time and a lot of expense wasted with the High Court action that will inevitably follow if this bill is not split. As I indicated earlier, who will be paying for that? It will be the taxpayers of Australia. It will not come out of Senator Evans's pocket; it will come out of the pockets of the taxpayers of Australia at a time when I believe that the government is very interested in a deficit reduction strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about saving time and if we are talking about certainty before the law, because all of these queer constitutional questions have been raised before the committee, we should be prudent.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule, page 7, item 8, Table 2 contained in proposed subsection 6AAA(6), omit from Column 1 of the Table "11(E)(3)".</PARA>
<PARA>This request, which has been circulated in my name, omits section 11(E)(3) from column 1 of the table. Section 11(E)(3) of the Excise Tariff Act refers to fuel oil, heating oil, lighting kerosene and power kerosene. Those are the only fuels that the act refers to. In effect, this amendment is requesting the House of Representatives to defeat the provision of this legislation that provides for a 1c increase in excise on those fuels in February of next year and a 1c increase in August of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure I am proposing substantially affects bunkering oil, which is required for ships. There has already been a 3c increase since budget night. The increase of 1c in February of next year will represent an increase of 12 per cent in the excise tax on bunker oil and the other oils I mentioned. The increase of 1c in August of next year will represent a further 11 per cent increase in that tax. I am suggesting to the committee that that is absolutely beyond the pale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From memory the current tax on those fuels is 5.44c per litre. Since budget night a 3c increase has been imposed and it is proposed that there will be two 1c increases next year. That is a 5c increase in total. That represents a 92 per cent increase on those fuels that I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might ask about the increase on the other fuels. Presumably, that will be a matter that will be debated when we come to the next bill. From memory that increase of 5c will represent something like a nine per cent increase in total. The minister will correct me if I am wrong. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an argument that if one is going along the path of a long-term deficit reduction strategy, one should not impose an unfair taxation burden on certain types of fuels. In my view, under those circumstances a special case can be advanced for the fuels I have mentioned&mdash;bunkering fuel, heating oil, lighting kerosene and power kerosene. </PARA>

Therefore, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 link the duration of the collection of the excise tariff with the ability and the willingness of government to look seriously at the serious situation of lead abatement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of Greens (WA) amendments demands some measure of gain for the pain imposed. For this reason we are attaching three conditions to the bill. The government has said that by making the tax conditional it can achieve real reductions in the lead levels found in petrol. These amendments put this commitment in writing. They use the government's timetable of achieving the goals by 1995. The government at least has to show that it has had an honest try. It also says that the government should work out a timetable to phase out leaded petrol completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second condition says that the government should set emission efficiency and safety standards on new vehicles at a level as high as those set elsewhere. Under the proposed amendments, it has until 1995 to do so. The third condition is that the government should set up moderately funded programs designed to implement the recommendations of its own ecologically sustainable development transport policy study by 1995. These include a range of measures designed to reduce the need for and use of private cars while increasing amenity and equity. This would be funded at the rate of 1c per litre. This in some way counteracts the scheduled reduction of funding for urban development and public transport of over $1.6 billion over the next four years. In addition, the amendments would exempt freight, shipping and rail from the increases, and these will be mentioned later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current levels of lead in petrol are controlled by state law. Maximum lead levels vary between 0.30 grams per litre and 0.84 grams per litre. Lead levels vary to match the standards. Internationally, many European nations set their levels at 1.5 grams per litre. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 0.15. The US maximum level is 0.026 and will drop to zero by 1995. Japan already sets a zero level for lead. The USEPA did a study with industry that was fully justified and the result was that lead levels could be reduced from 1.1 grams per litre to 0.1 grams per litre at a cost of 0.16c a litre, although this may not include constant octane requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petrol industry in Australia has given a non-justified costing of 2c a litre to drop lead to 0.15 grams per litre, whilst retaining the octane level. There was a round table discussion between industry, the Federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, and the states on 29 July, in which it was recommended that New South Wales and Victoria go to 0.2 grams per litre in 1994 and that other states go to 0.3, with all states setting a limit of 0.2 by 1995. Industry would be allowed to drop the octane level by one unit, making the  change  virtually  value  neutral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was the result the amendment requires. Currently, however, the Commonwealth has no direct powers over lead levels. It remains up to the states to implement the recommendations. The Commonwealth does have persuasive and coercive powers and potential powers for the proposed national EPA. Due to the uncertainty, the amendment will allow evidence that the government has genuinely consistently used its powers to try to attain those goals accepted by both houses in the event that it fails to attain the results. In many respects, the current problem is a result of the fact that cars using leaded petrol are not old; they are pre-1986. In the USA, legislation prohibited lead petrol engines from 1974. This means that its old polluting car fleet is 20, rather than eight, years old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial legislation in the USA was not about lead. It was about emission standards. Lead poisons catalytic converters, so it was banned. We are still far behind the USA in legislating for emission standards. Our standards put hydrocarbons at 0.93 grams per kilometre. Those in the USA are 0.25 grams per kilometre. Our standards for carbon monoxide are 9.3 grams per kilometre. Those of the United States are 2.1. Nitrogen oxides in Australia are 1.93. In the United States, they are 0.62. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States EPA is initiating another round of increased standards in 1994 which are liable to be far stricter than the existing ones. State laws, such as the California ultra low emission standards, are stricter still, moving incrementally from total hydrocarbon emission levels of 0.25 grams per millilitre in 1994 to 0.62 in 2003, averaged across the vehicle fleet. Several US states will adopt these standards by 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also sets standards for other emissions, such as formaldehyde at 0.008 grams per millilitre in methanol vehicles. It demands that two per cent of all vehicles supplied by the manufacturer must have zero emissions by 1998, increasing to 10 per cent by 2003. Similarly, Europe will intensify its standards in 1996 and 1999, at which point they will be among the strictest and they will be comparable with the California ultra low standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Auto manufacturers must meet these standards, and they do. Unleaded engines and petrol were available to meet legislated deadlines in the United States of America. The technology will be available to meet new US and European standards. In some cases, such as with the Sarich two-stroke engine, they are already capable of meeting these standards. Where standards were not required, as in Australia with lead, they were not offered. We are paying for that now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can duplicate the errors of the past or we can say, `us too', and demand that the best and cleanest technology required and available elsewhere is required here too. This will also have an effect on exports. Where we do not require technology to meet environmental standards, we often do not develop technology that can do so. When other nations do set standards, our exports are often restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has no real excuse for not setting standards that can be achieved elsewhere by global industry, such as the automotive industry. It does not cost anything and it is no burden on industry to sell us cars that it is already manufacturing for other markets. It is easier and cheaper to do things the best way from the beginning, rather than trying to fix them later. This is what the second condition will ensure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the full package that we are suggesting, in relation to ecologically sustainable cities, the government conducted a major policy study running up to the Earth Summit in 1992. It was called the ecologically sustainable development policy study. It was one of the most expensive policy exercises done in this country with extensive consultation between government, industry and the environment movement and with opportunities for public and academic input over a long period. It was supposed to set the framework for Australian policy into the next century, to set the direction the country would go. The transport working group set forward a number of recommendations after over a year of intensive effort. I therefore urge the chamber to support these requests for amendments to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will be opposing these requests, but not because anybody challenges the underlying objectives of trying to reduce lead levels in petrol, reduce emissions, increase fuel efficiency, et cetera. Nobody, at least on this side, is opposed to pursuing ecologically sustainable cities. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) has put a lot of his time and effort, intellectually and physically, into moving in that direction. It does not mean that carrying a resolution in the chamber in support of something is a practical way of achieving the desired objective. It may have some downsides that we need to be concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important distinction needs to be made between talking about something that is undeniably important and doing something important. Here we have that significant distinction, because there is no question about the importance of the issues which have been brought before us, not just as a result of these requests, but because the issues are inherent in the nature of the bills we are discussing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will talk briefly about lead levels. The Commonwealth cannot legislate for lead levels in petrol; it is a state responsibility. I realise the request is trying to come to grips with that difficult question, but that is where the inherent flaw in that part of the amendment lies. It seems to me that seeking to ensure that both houses of parliament acknowledge that the government has put all the pressure on the state governments to pass the necessary legislation is a very strange legislative mechanism. I would not want to be putting all my faith in the way either house of parliament might handle such an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 0.2 level is one that the government is pursuing anyway, as Senator Margetts knows. I forget whether she referred to it but I know that she is conscious of it from her knowledge in the area as a result of agreements reached at the lead round table. So we are trying to push in that direction, but I do not think this is the way to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern about ADRs for emissions and fuel efficiency. The Australian industry has significant concerns about the rapid implementation of such a proposal. It appears that it would be very expensive to have to adjust very quickly through our motor industry to seek to achieve world best practice in ADRs in the timetable we are talking about. There is a concern that this would significantly increase car prices, and that it would lead to a significant increase in the purchase and use of imported vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think this is the wrong instrument to be pursuing to seek to achieve the fuel efficiency objective. The emissions objective will not do what we want and will have a significant counterproductive impact on the motor vehicle industry in a way that I do not think the Senate would wish to see; the government certainly does not wish to see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the ecologically sustainable cities trust fund, there is a profound concern about the idea that we should, in a revenue measure like this, rather arbitrarily establish an amount that should go off to fund such a broadly described objective. There are a number of expenditure programs that we think would fit in with an ecologically sustainable city. An initiative the government is taking in cooperation with the South Australian and New South Wales governments, for example, is the better cities program. But we do not have a definition of whether people think that would fit in or not. I do not think it is the way we should be proceeding to pursue those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, put fairly briefly and concisely because we are seeking to get all the areas of legislation passed today, the government will not be supporting this request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make two points. The first is that it seems to me quite a legitimate approach from the Greens to the extent that the government did dress up this measure as an environmental move when in actual fact that was not its primary objective at all; it was a tax raising revenue measure, a revenue raiser. When an analysis was done immediately after the budget, even the government had to back away from its claim that it was principally environmental. If we are going to differentiate further between the fuels, leaded or unleaded, one way we can do it in an environmentally sound way is to reduce the tax on the unleaded. But the government was not going to do that. It wanted to gain further revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the second point I wanted to make, and that is that it was a revenue raising measure that was particularly going to hurt the less well-off in our community. It is this aspect, this regressivity in the budget, a Labor government attacking those whom it would claim to be primarily its own people, the lower income earners in our society, that so astonished so many Australians and that has contributed to that enormous slump in the opinion polls away from Labor. The one thing the so-called true believers did not expect was this government, immediately upon being re-elected&mdash;re-elected on lies, I might say&mdash;thanking the true believers and then coming in and attacking them with this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for Senator McMullan to shed crocodile tears; the true believers who thought they could trust the government and believe in it, the government let down in a big way in this budget. It particularly attacked the less well-off in the community by imposing a tax that hurt them more than the better off. It is as simple as that. They were very disappointed and they have expressed that through those opinion polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I wanted to make is that that has the effect, I think, of legitimising the debate, demonstrating that this is not an environmental measure by the government at all; it is a revenue measure and a measure that is going to particularly hurt the poor. As my colleague Senator Watson said, regrettably we have some concerns with the detail of this proposal. We do not agree with the leverage, which is really the design; it is a legitimate political measure for the Greens to promote. We do not believe that it is a legitimate leverage in terms of, in particular, what is in the best interests of the poor. Therefore, we are not prepared to support it on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We, of course, are committed very much to the same direction which has been outlined by the Greens. We also share their great concern that the increase in the excise on petroleum and the additional excise on leaded fuel were measures which were in the right direction in terms of the environment but were quite cynically being used by government as an increased source of revenue. We therefore sought to negotiate with government in relation to a package which would seek to address some of the problems which have been outlined by Senator Margetts this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel that the move to set lower levels of lead, while completely justified&mdash;and Senator Margetts is absolutely correct in pointing to the zero levels in Japan, to the level of 0.026 grams per litre in America and to similar low levels in many European countries&mdash;or the government's approach, which is simply to increase the excise, by themselves are not sufficient. We have sought to go down a somewhat different road, and that is to seek to encourage the government to provide a non-lead alternative to leaded fuels. I would like to outline the agreement which we understand the government has given because we believe that, at least to some extent, it does meet the concerns of the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically in relation to an alcohol-petrol mix called gasohol, the government has undertaken to provide $25 million over three years, starting in 1994-95, at a rate of $6 million in that year, $8 million in 1995-96 and $11 million in 1996-98 in the form of a bounty which, according to our agreement, is to be paid at the rate of 17.5c per litre. I am still waiting on Senator McMullan to, hopefully, confirm that that might be adjusted to 18c per litre. I hope that he will have a reply to that request by the time I am finished speaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bounty would be paid only on Australian produced alcohol to go into gasohol. It would also be directed towards new production, because this is an industry that we hope to see expand rapidly. That amount would be sufficient in most cases to meet the demand for bounty for those who would get into the industry. If funds were left over, there would be a rollover of funds from one year into the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The other condition that will apply to that bounty is that there will be a review of the bounty process at the end of fiscal 1995-96. Hopefully, by that time, if this industry goes as expected, one would see a burgeoning industry which is initially based on waste starch such as the molasses which is left over from sugar refining and one would see expanding into the Australian economy an alternative fuel at the same cost as unleaded fuel which has very considerable advantages. Not only does it remove lead; it reduces the emissions of carbon monoxide&mdash;something mentioned by Senator Margetts&mdash;nitrogen oxides, unburnt hydrocarbons, substantially reduces the emissions of greenhouse gases and, of course, moves us very substantially towards the establishment of an indigenous renewable fuel industry. That is one of the main mid-term objectives over the next 10 to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators might have noticed in one of today's newspapers an article saying that, by the year 2005, Australia will only be half as self-sufficient in petroleum as it is today. We have not discovered new petroleum reserves in the last 20 years. It is desperately necessary for this country to make a substantial shift, for economic as well as environmental reasons, to a sustainable fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the burgeoning of a new technology which will derive ethanol from cellulose materials, it is quite conceivable that, early in the next century, we could derive all of our transport fuels from renewable sources. This package, which has been agreed to by government, also includes $1.69 million in 1993-94 and $2.25 million in the following year, most of which will be targeted into the remaining technical problems in relation to the derivation of alcohol from cellulosic materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of standards for fuel, and in particular for alcohol-petrol mixes, has also been picked up in this agreement. In addition, there is funding of $4 million for a lead education program. That is essential because it is possible that half of those people out there who are now using leaded fuel in pre-1986 cars could immediately make the transition to unleaded fuel. They need to be informed that their make and model of car can make that transition without any change. There are additional sums for the assay of blood lead levels in the community and the development of standards. Also, very importantly, a small amount&mdash;half a million dollars 1993-94 and 1994-95&mdash;will be provided for an investigation of other devices which are claimed to be suitable for cars otherwise requiring either higher octane or leaded fuel. Even if all of these devices which are claimed to be satisfactory in this regard prove to be worthless, it will be well worth while the government finding that out and informing people. These devices cost some $200 or $300 and, if they are worthless, then people should know about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the issue of gasohol as an alternative fuel, interestingly, in view of the developments in the last 24 hours in which I have said a great deal about the potential for this burgeoning technology in Australia, I was approached this morning by the Japanese embassy for all information which I have available on this technology. That indicates the vast difference in approach to new technology between Japan on the one hand and this country, where we have had to bludgeon $35 million out of government for a program which carries with it not only the opportunity to address a very significant problem in relation to lead but also the potential to make us self-sufficient and greenhouse gas emission free with respect to transport fuels early in the next century.

We are mindful that unless a standard is adopted at the start it would be possible for the program to be jeopardised through the deliberate provision of fuel which does not meet the standard. The Government seems to be very mindful that any hitches in the use of the new fuel may reflect on the Government and for this reason also it should seek to adopt a proven standard as quickly as possible.</PARA>

Last night she at least acknowledged that the only reason they could negotiate and get any of the deals that they managed to gain from the government was that the opposition took a stance that enabled the Greens to have a base to negotiate from. Had we not taken that stance, there would have been no room for either Senator Chamarette or Senator Margetts to negotiate with the government over the various issues; there would not have been anywhere near enough votes. I am very pleased we were able to give Senator Chamarette that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past four or five weeks we have also seen the Democrats negotiate with the government, but I have not seen any acknowledgment from them of the fact that, if it were not for the stance that the coalition had taken, they would not have had the opportunity to negotiate exactly what they were able to from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment briefly on the Greens' amendments. I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Watson and with my leader, Senator Hill, that the practicality of putting those somewhat ideological amendments into practice is far too difficult. Also, in line with the other things that the Greens have managed, as they say, to negotiate, the impact of what they wish to do has to be taken fully into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that when the Greens voted to increase the excise on fuel they did not take into account the fact that the women in our society will be hurt most of all. The women in our society will suffer most.

But I know that Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts are very conscious of the effect that this will have on women. According to a study in one-car households, the woman's use of the car was much more likely to be cut back first. Also, in the case of two-car households, the car that a woman drives is more likely to be sold first. I know that this would help the Greens' cause in getting fewer vehicles on the road, but it seems to me to be very unfair that the women in our society should suffer.</PARA></TALK.START>

I can name North Rankin field off the north west coast of Western Australia as one. Virtually the whole of the North West Shelf has been discovered in the past 20 years. Twenty years only takes us back to 1973. That was the year of the big fuel price hike because we were scared throughout the world that we were going to run out of hydrocarbons. That was the reason that world parity pricing came in at the time. I think Doug Anthony flagged it at the time in the double dissolution of 1974. It was a pity that he flagged it before the dissolution because the coalition lost that election and then the Labor government brought parity pricing in anyhow. But that was a blatantly untrue statement and I think Senator Coulter ought to check his facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to Senator Coulter over the years, and especially over the past few days, talking about the grain alcohol technology that he says Australia should be using instead of the present hydrocarbon fuels that we are using. But that technology has been around since about 1942. It was developed during the last war to try to make up for the fuel shortage in Australia. To my knowledge it was revived in the 1960s and in about 1973 when we suffered a supposed petroleum shortage in the world. In fact, I can remember corresponding with a crowd of grain growers in the United States at length to find out whether we could do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer was that we could make our own fuel alcohol, but the cost was virtually twice what we were already paying. What is more, its performance was not so great, but I was prepared to put up with that. However, what turned me off it was the rate at which one could make the product per day. After importing a still or whatever they call it from the United States, we would be burning three times the amount we could make even if we ran the plant 24 hours&mdash;and it is quite easy to run a plant for 24 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this technology is around, but next Senator Coulter will be talking about going back to the gas-producer that was around during the war. Incidentally, when I was in Queensland a few months ago I saw one working up there. It was quite an antique. The point is that technology has been around. It has not been developed anywhere near fast enough to make it efficient for use in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Coulter should do a bit more homework before he trots in with these ideas. If the Western Australian Greens think the same, I suggest to them that they look into this technology. I can give them my records and my correspondence from about 1976. In fact, I was going to go to the United States then to have a look at the technology to gain a better understanding of it. An unfortunate situation happened in the family and I put off going, so I never got there. I have kept in contact with the technology, and I think Senator Coulter is playing with the fairies at the bottom of the garden if he expects too much of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the Western Australia Greens doing about the cost of fuel in Australia? Senator Margetts has gone on record in Western Australia as being the new senator for the Pilbara. I did not mind her visiting the Pilbara and giving me a bit of competition by being known as the senator for the Pilbara and the Kimberleys. But if she goes up there as often as I think she does&mdash;I suppose she has her own reasons for going to Karratha of all places&mdash;I wish she would listen to and learn from all the people up there instead of just the odd one or two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chamber should remember that Senator Margetts was elected from the preferences of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, as Senator Chris Evans reminded me today. Someone had said that she was elected on other preferences and he wanted to run in here and tell us, but I put the matter straight this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts has been elected on Liberal Party preferences in Western Australia so the Greens should really think about what they do to those inland areas that they claimed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Australian</EMPHASIS> to have a full understanding of. They should think about what they are going to do for them. Judging by the way the Greens have been voting on this and other bills, it seems they are going in exactly the opposite direction to the one Senator Margetts outlined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Western Australian</EMPHASIS> a couple of weeks ago. She said in that journal that the Greens would reduce costs in the country. I am watching Senator Margetts, and Western Australia is listening to what she says, as we approach this division to see exactly which way the Greens will vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens claimed in the media yesterday that they have got $144 million out of this budget for the people. That is out of a total of nearly $2 billion under this legislation. That is in a full financial year&mdash;and a very small one this year.

When Senator Margetts makes statements in the press, I suggest that she does her thinking and votes that way. </PARA>

The main game here is whether we can cut oil prices below the levels that the government would have the average consumer paying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to Senator Coulter that it is far better to have a discrepancy in price in the country if the price is only 65c a litre than if all prices are equal at 80c a litre. The issue is what price the consumer in the country has to pay? I think people listening to this broadcast should be aware that the Democrats have a real chance to do two things today. The first is to keep the government honest, a matter that was raised by my colleague Senator Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let it go on the record once again that if the government had been up front with its election promises, if it had indicated during the election period that it would impose a substantial excise on fuel, it would not be in government today. That is why people say time and again that this government lied its way into office. It did, and there is no question of that. I suspect that when Senator McMullan gets up to reply he will not answer that question because it cannot be answered. Senator McMullan did not go around in the four or five weeks of the election campaign and say, `Yes, here is the taxation agenda of the Labor Party. We are going to put up fuel excises and raise a massive amount of money'. So one of the issues the Australian Democrats have to address is whether they will keep the government honest. That was the great catchcry of the Democrats&mdash;keeping the bastards honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of accountability, honesty and ethics in government, governments should be required to keep their promises. There is no excuse for this government, having gone to an election saying that it would not increase taxes, imposing this massive increase in fuel excise. So the first issue the Democrats have to address is whether they will support us in our attempt to keep the government true to its election promises?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is the practical one of whether they will try to keep down one of the massive costs that particularly country people have to bear? I refer to the cost of fuel. Senator Coulter will have to vote for whether he wants to put up fuel prices. Senator Coulter drew our attention to the particular problems of country people, and those people should know that Senator Coulter and his colleagues, by standing with us on this particular issue, can make sure that fuel prices do not continue to rise and do not put a particularly heavy burden on country people. Those are the issues which Senator Coulter and his colleagues must address. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first instance, the proposition of an extra 2c levy by this government under the guise of an environmental measure, a health measure&mdash;that is, to encourage people to move from leaded petrol to another way of propelling themselves around the countryside&mdash;was immediately transparent. It was put forward not for that reason at all but rather as a revenue raising effort, which Senator Margetts and Senator Coulter identified. In fact, the instant it was proposed the Democrats identified that as being inequitable. The people who are driving such vehicles that apparently need to use leaded petrol would have had the choice of modifying their vehicle at great cost, selling a devalued car at a great loss, or meeting the extra imposition. That was the question we immediately addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter, at great personal endeavour, arrived at a situation where those people who had been placed by the government in this iniquitous position would have an alternative. To arrive at that alternative, Senator Coulter has delineated the negotiations which delivered a package which I feel proud to be associated with after Senator Coulter's considerable efforts on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that after those efforts we now have an opportunity for this country to participate in the many benefits that Senator Coulter outlined earlier. Having done that, then looking at the complete package itself, we believe that the primary concern, that of equity for the people so affected, had been addressed. The other concern, providing a path by which lead could be removed from the environment so that it would no longer affect the health of our children, had also been addressed by what Senator Coulter has managed to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bonus was the opportunity for further employment in rural and regional Australia for a burgeoning industry, for increased employment and for moving towards a sustainable industry which does not rely on the exploitation of non-renewable resources. Having done that, I think we can honestly say that we have addressed the original problems&mdash;and then some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the amendments proposed by Senator Margetts. I feel a little uncomfortable in being required to address all of the amendments as a package. There are particular ones which I want to be associated with very strongly&mdash;for example, 4(2)(d), which this is all linked to&mdash;and there is consideration of continued operation of amendments. This part seeks to be associated with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the passage through the Parliament of a bill for an Act to establish an ecologically sustainable cities trust fund for the purpose of implementing an ecologically sustainable transport and urban development policy and for related purposes, being an Act which:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)implements the recommendations of the Ecologically Sustainable Development Transport Working Group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This is the group which considered the very matters which are at the heart of what was purported to be the government's reason for introducing the 2c levy on leaded fuel to start with. That amendment does address that and it achieves those very aims which the government purported to achieve when it introduced its money grab&mdash;revenue grab. This is something that is worth supporting and should be endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the total package which gives me some trouble because it compromises the government's deficit reduction strategy. But I am prepared to put aside that disquiet for the purposes of endorsing and being seen to encourage the government to see the benefit of such amendments and to consider the merit of addressing such an attitude in future. I think it is very important that we all consider and carefully undertake an attitude change. It would mean that, rather than looking at a situation where we were continually dependent upon the car to such an extent that future governments could trap us as a community into being milch cows for revenue raising without alternatives, we would be liberated from the dependence upon motor vehicle transport as we know it now. That very important part of that amendment is one which needs to be read and read again and, I hope, read again next year in the budget formulation process that the government goes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must emphasise that the strategy of addressing all the problems that were brought about by the 2c money grab on leaded petrol has, in fact, been addressed by the package that was negotiated by Senator Coulter, which is by far the most sensible way to go. These amendments do address that in part. They also express this need to consider the other factors involved in our whole attitude towards transport. For that reason, I will be supporting these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few comments on the various arguments that have been put today. To Senator McMullan, I put a very simple question: why are we prepared to take second best? We know the technology is available in other countries and we know that it can be made available. So, as a parliament, why do we not have the guts to stand up and expect the best from industry, or why do we allow it to give us second best in that technology and available methods?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is an economic point in relation to that: if we cannot match United States standards, we will never be ready for export of this particular product&mdash;that is, engines and car manufacture&mdash;which is supposedly one of the kinds of things that government is expecting. If we are prepared to allow industry to hide behind inadequate processes and standards simply because we do not have the political will to expect and demand better from it, then it is up to the government to look very carefully at its real desire for industry to export. It is part of the integrated strategy that I was talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, I have heard about costs but nobody&mdash;apart from the Democrats, whom I thank for their words of support&mdash;is prepared to talk about the benefits accruing to such policies. They are obviously health benefits and environmental benefits, but they are also economic benefits associated with an integrated package of reduced car use and reduced lead production. The social cost of lead poisoning obviously is well known, which is why we are talking about this in such a public way. There are also a great deal of other benefits in medical costs that normally do not become obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to economic benefits, the government is talking about putting out an employment white paper. What I fear will come out from that kind of white paper is either a scheme for reducing wages and conditions in some regions, and paying people some kind of bounty to exploit in wages and conditions; or make-work schemes in infrastructure that the community or regions have not been necessarily involved with. But here we have the possibility for both employment creation and benefits to the community which will bring other benefits and cut down costs in the future. If we are looking at good employment strategies, why not think about those which have both environmental benefits and equity benefits, as the better cities program was designed to do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson said that ideologically sound ideas are too difficult. I think that has been the response from many people over many years. But if the United States can do it, and it is looking at the dollars, why can we not do so? If Japan can cut down emissions and get world best standards in many industries, why can we not do so&mdash;and there is a dollar in it for better emissions standards? Therefore, it is not whether or not we choose a good economy or good economic practices, or whether we choose a good environment; we can have both&mdash;and it has been clearly demonstrated that we can have both. We can reduce costs in many ways if we think better and not in a narrow way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Democrats for their integrated package with relation to ethanol.

We cannot put them off; we cannot pretend they do not exist; and we cannot pretend that dollars are in the way of us achieving them, because they are not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in the comments made by Senator Margetts. Given the force of that delivery, I presume that she will be supporting our amendment in terms of diesel excise. Senator Margetts was talking about pollutant fuels. She would be aware of the submission that was provided by the Australian bus and coach industry. It put a very good case for the Senate to reject the excise because of the impact that it would have on the bus and coach industry and in terms of environmental issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Margetts, to give her time to consider her position regarding the excise, of the fact that buses are far more friendly to the environment. Buses are six times more fuel efficient than passenger vehicles. Buses use lead-free diesel, and diesel results in fewer emissions and fewer greenhouse gases. Fuels which are even more friendly, such as LNG, are being actively trialled across Australia. In terms of congestion, buses are 14 times more efficient in carrying people than is the average car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the eloquence of Senator Margetts's address regarding the impact on the environment, I introduce these concepts to her in terms of her need to consider her remarks when we come to seeking to remove the excise in relation to buses and cars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot let Senator Watson's remarks pass without some comment. It is certainly true that some of the emissions from diesel are less than those from petrol engines. However, I point out to him that those who are experimenting with the diesohol mix&mdash;that is, 15 per cent alcohol in diesel&mdash;which, interestingly, is now being trialled in Sweden under Australian patents, found that the Australian diesel was so poor in quality that even in a very low concentration it could not be used to mix with the alcohol for export to Sweden. The experimenters had to import diesel from Sweden, mix it with the alcohol and then re-export it to Sweden. In our diesel we have very high levels of sulphur and also of polycyclic hydrocarbons, which are carcinogenic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government, with minimum notice, reintroduced measures to impose a sales tax on wine; with even less notice, adjourned debate at the second reading stage; and, with even less notice still, brought on the debate again. I think this gives some indication of the lack of order and preparedness in the government's presentation of its bills this afternoon. The imposts in these new bills are at a lower rate than the original 1993 budget imposts on the wine industry which ranged up to an increase of 55 per cent. In other words, the government has now structured the sales tax bills so as to put the matters beyond constitutional challenge. I only wish that it had adopted such a responsible attitude earlier today with the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 2).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a significant contradiction in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner). The government has been at pains to point out&mdash;and the minister points out in his second reading speech&mdash;that the government does not accept that any of the bills in this package impose tax. This has been a central thrust of what the government has been all about in terms of its presentation of the constitutional debate. However, within a few lines of the second reading speech, that statement is contradicted. It is amazing. The speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For constitutional reasons, the sales tax is imposed by 4 Acts.</PARA>
<PARA>Here are the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those Acts impose sales tax to the extent that it is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a duty of customs;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a duty of excise;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a tax on in situ . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on. So here in the government's second reading speech is an inherent contradiction of its own argument throughout the whole of this constitutional debate. We are seeing an internal inconsistency, a contradiction; one wonders really whether the government understands what it is legislating for. There is a great deal of confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 31 per cent rate of tax on alcoholic wines will apply between budget night and the end of October, but from the end of October there will be a decrease in the rate of tax to 22 per cent, which will operate for only eight months. How much wine will be sold between today and 1 November? Who is going to pay a rate of 31 per cent when in the next month they will pay the rate of 22 per cent&mdash;a clear difference of nine percentage points?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it does not stop there. From 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995 the rate will increase to 24 per cent and from 1995 onwards it will increase to 26 per cent. This government is trying to get most of its tax imposts introduced early to overcome debate closer to the next election. Today we are seeing part of a package which increases indirect taxes to pay for the income tax cuts. In other words, income tax cuts are being subsidised and financed as a result of increased indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had it not been for the stance taken by the Liberal and National party coalition, Australia would have had the highest taxes on wine anywhere in the world. The wine industry has to thank the Liberal and National party coalition for its stand on this. There have been significant reductions and they have been welcomed. From our perspective, the government promised no tax increases in this area, and it broke that election promise. In breaking that promise, at the same time it adopted thuggery and blackmail and tried to intimidate the industry. It tried to divide the industry between the small producers and the large producers. It was rather pathetic because the tactics employed actually did split the industry and they created divisions and concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's blackmail was to threaten to impose an excise proposal. An excise proposal is an increase in tax at a time when it does not have to have legislative support through this parliament. What would that do to the wine industry? It would decimate its sales because one would never know when the legislation would come in and get knocked off. This was the dilemma faced by the industry. It could not afford such a hiatus, and it buckled. It is not surprising because a lot of the wine producers were facing bankruptcy, peril and division amongst their colleagues. This is a terrible state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This division is typical of the Keating administration. We have seen it in Mabo, in the tax bills and in the thuggery of the negotiations and the blackmail that takes place. No wonder the industry is bitter and frustrated. We should remember that it was faced with that 55 per cent increase&mdash;a terrific impost. I only hope that the Greens and others will be able to produce a similar percentage reduction when we come to the excise duties. In that case people are facing not a 55 per cent increase but a 92 per cent increase in tax. This tax will severely impact on our export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indirect tax hikes of this magnitude are anathema to the Australian people and Australian business. We are really seeing a GST without the benefits to industry of the GST rebates. This government is imposing costs and making industry uncompetitive. I put it to the Senate that the Liberal and National party coalition will continue to oppose these increases if for no other reason than that we cannot endorse the sorts of tactics employed by the Labor Party in getting its alleged mandate on the books. It will not receive anywhere near its budget level of revenue. It will have a win but at great cost to the Australian community and at great cost to its own revenue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we are hoping to get this package of bills through tonight, I will keep my remarks as brief as possible. I found it very interesting listening to Senator Watson when he said that he acknowledges the damage that all of this is doing to the industry and the damage it has done to the industry. It is estimated that lost sales have amounted to $75 million. I certainly agree that the Labor Party embarked on a whole series of actions that can best be described as holding not one but two guns to the head of the industry. There was the threat, as has already been outlined, of an excise proposal, and there was also the threat of people stopping buying wine, which is what the community has been doing. So there was a financial impost that the wine industry found unbearable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I have to ask the Liberals why they want to prolong this matter. Why does the opposition end up in a position where it is totally out in the cold? If we do not support this package, as objectionable as we find the government's actions in terms of the means by which it was arrived at, we will be stretching out this agony for month after month. All the government will do is let this bill ricochet off to the House of Representatives where it will probably sit around. It does not have to bring it back for three months if it is defeated. Then we are looking at February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The busiest period for the wine industry is coming up shortly, with Christmas. Indeed, it makes about one-third of its sales between now and 25 December. It is extremely urgent that we give this industry some respite. So it is beyond me to understand why the Liberals continue to pursue this agenda. It was through their opposition that the industry was able to get into a position where there could be some resolution. But now there is some resolution across the entire industry, bar perhaps four per cent of its work force. I am not talking about just the winemakers, who have been united from the start, but also the grape growers, who have consulted amongst their industry and brought that section almost on board, and the retail sales people, who perhaps at the moment are the most desperate to get this package through because they are the ones whose pockets are being hit immediately. The winemakers are being hit particularly with cellar door sales, and as yet the grape growers do not really understand the financial impost of what has been going on over the last couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to suggest to members of the Liberal Party that now they are basically just acting as spoilers. They have lost this debate. Therefore, they are in a situation of digging themselves into a larger and larger hole by opposing this package which, I stress again, has been agreed to by the industry&mdash;an industry which, I suggest, is probably more united than it ever has been before. That is saying something about an industry that has already achieved an enormous amount without any government interference and without any direct government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one positive thing that has come out of all of this is that an industry plan will now be developed. If we look to the old saying that `every cloud has a silver lining', the silver lining in this, as well as the fact that we now have an industry that is united across its various sections, is that we will have an industry plan that will hopefully put in place something that the industry will be proud to work towards and which the government will accept and not try to tamper with again by any impost, be it tax or any other alterations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we must pass this package is so that sales can start again. Most of the wine that has not been sold over the last few weeks will not be sold. Consumers will not now go out and buy and drink the wine that they have not drunk over the past weeks. If they did, the whole country would end up legless. But planning can begin. The wine catalogues for Christmas are sitting there simply waiting for the prices to be put on them before they are sent out. Planting can resume. In the several areas in South Australia where it was stopped, the various processes involved with arranging those plantings will now go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot leave my remarks tonight without commenting on the activities of the Labor Party. I believe it had absolutely no idea of what its impost would do to this industry. The previous debates on the original bill showed that it had done no planning. Indeed, I cannot understand why the government has criticised us for listening to the wine industry, because it has no better source of information. Hopefully, after we have had this inquiry, all of us from all parties will be able to see where the wine industry is going, what support it needs and, hopefully, what interference it does not need in order to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could not challenge industry claims because it simply had no better source of information. As we went through the previous debate, it seemed that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) did not really know anything of the plan to increase the sales tax on wine until it was all decided, signed, sealed and printed. I believe the government stands condemned for what it has done to the Australian wine industry. Hopefully, it has now learnt some lessons about process and about how one goes about developing an industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims that have been made about the industry being forced to negotiate are quite true. I certainly do not condone the methods which the government used. But that does not mean that we now work around, or try to walk away from, the only means of getting this industry back on its feet. I urge the Liberals to think again, to stop this mindless opposition for the sake of opposing, and to look at what they are doing to one of Australia's most successful industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I have made clear over time and during the last debate the concerns of the Greens (WA) about the 31 per cent sales tax impost on the wine industry, especially in relation to regional development and those things that do work at regional level, the government's purported desire to get regional development up and going and its purported desire to support employment initiatives. We have made that quite clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also give the Senate some idea of the kind of difficulty that we have found ourselves in in the last week or so in relation to the pleas and messages we had been receiving from the wine industry right across Australia, particularly from Western Australia. I will read some of the messages that we have received. This plea is on behalf of the east coast of Tasmania winemakers and grape growers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please oppose this terrible deal that Mr Croser has organised with the labour party. The wine farmers in this area feel that the concerns of the small producer are not being met. The wine makers federation gave no indication or chance for any of its members to vote or have a say in these deals.</PARA>
<PARA>This message, which comes from Pemberton in Western Australia, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge you to stand firm against proposed increase in sales tax on wine. Brian Croser has "sold" small producers up the river through political and economic pressure by Dawkins. Concessions needed urgently by small winemakers to enable them to survive have not been adequately addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>The South West Development Authority said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wine industry is of critical importance in our rapidly expanding tourism activity in our region, and any additional impost will limit that growth. The wine industry is also a substantial employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capital investment required for the expansion of the wine industry will dry up with any tax increase.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are urged to oppose the tax increase.</PARA>
<PARA>A plea from Mudgee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please do not capitulate regarding wine tax proposal. We can't afford it and still survive.</PARA>
<PARA>A message received from the Margaret River area states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short we now urge you to withstand the pressures&mdash;which apparently pertain to represent this community and all other communities of small premium wine producers&mdash;but do not! Please do not allow the governments package to succeed as is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This one, from Gunyulgup in Western Australia, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Don't compromise integrity due to the pressure from those who don't care.</PARA>
<PARA>Another plea from the Margaret River states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry needs no cash grants, investment subsidies or any hidden sweeteners. What we do need is some understanding brought about by improved government-industry consultations.</PARA>
<PARA>This message, which comes from Elizabeth Bay in New South Wales, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our company is appalled at the decision purportedly entered on behalf of the wine industry by the Wine Makers Federation of Australia. Attached is a copy of my fax sent this morning to Mr Brian Croser. We would urge you to continue your support for rejection to the Government's measures.</PARA>
<PARA>Having said all that, we have become aware that much of the problem has been related to the fact that very few of the winegrowers and producers in Australia know of the details of the package that was offered to the industry. The circumstances of the forced commitment by a number of people acting on behalf of the wine industry did not allow time&mdash;perhaps it could have been better handled&mdash;for communicating many of those issues. Many of those issues still have not been resolved. However, what has finally come through is a message, but not from all these people. Some of them have not forgiven, and will not forgive, the Labor Party for the way that it has acted in this measure. They have asked me to speak out loudly about their hurt and anger at the way that they have been treated as an industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final quote is representative of what has now become, I suppose, a representative view of many parts of the industry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is really no other rational choice than to proceed with the recent Winemakers Federation of Australia's agreement with the Treasurer. No matter what transpires, the Treasurer will get increased taxation either as the wholesale tax, or an ad valorem excise. The industry cannot "win".</PARA>
<PARA>Is this the kind of negotiation and regional development strategy that this government wants? I am disgusted and so is the industry. It is not a win. It is a lose-lose situation. I hope that all those who were involved in this kind of dreadful exercise are ashamed of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reluctantly support the package. It has some benefits for some sectors. It does not fully address the problems of the industry. However, we have asked the government to make sure that the inquiry that is part of the package is not just for show. As such, I believe that the government will be announcing, as part of the minister's speech, the agreement that it has reached with the Greens in relation to the minimum requirement that we believe is necessary for a regional based study of the impacts of this kind of government policy on the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be watching the government like a hawk. I can tell the government that every sector of the wine industry&mdash;small and large growers and small and large producers&mdash;will also be watching it like a hawk to make sure that this study is representative, that it looks at regional implications, that it is fairly done and that the outcomes are properly considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I say that I believe that the Greens have once again been put in a very painful position. We feel for those people who are suffering. I would like to apologise to those people who may feel that we let them down by not continuing to hold out, even though they were hurting. Some people are still asking us to hold out on this legislation. In the end we had to make a decision on the balance, and the decision has fallen on the side of supporting the package and condemning the government for its method of operation in this manipulative process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can sympathise somewhat with Senator Margetts because when one considers the plight that this industry has been put in by the efforts of the government over the past two months, one can understand that when it comes down to a situation of blackmailing and bludgeoning the industry some people in the wine industry have found themselves in a desperate situation. I understood the concerns of Mr Croser and the people who belong to the Winemakers Federation when this government first came up with a 31 per cent sales tax on wine. I can understand the industry reaction and I can understand the grape growers reaction. I think the coalition was quite right to announce immediately that we would be opposing this tax. We have consistently opposed this legislation, and we will continue to oppose extra imposts on wine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we announced that we were going to oppose this legislation gave other people the opportunity to start negotiating. Unfortunately, the industry was blackmailed by the government with threats of an increase in excise and various other ways and means of making sure that, in the long run, it would get its way in some form or other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand that over that period of two months&mdash;and we all know about the drop in sales and the difficulties the industry was going through&mdash;something had to give. The way the government treated matters was that the people who were going to give first were the big wine makers who had the most to lose through their sales and who were in the strongest position to negotiate. We have a government that is prepared to negotiate with the big wine makers and big wine sellers but it is prepared to forget about the small grape grower and small wine producers so that it can raise revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not agree with Senator Lees when she says that the industry is more united than it has ever been. She is entitled to her point of view and maybe she has been talking to different people from those that I have been talking to. I tell the Senate that there are an enormous number of grape growers in South Australia who are still particularly unhappy with the package&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts says they support it. I was talking to people the other day who are still not supporting the legislation. People are still contacting me about this matter. When it comes to the crunch the people who will suffer the most, as always, will be the people at the grape growing end and at the primary production end. Those groups will be squeezed in the same way that any other primary producer in any other industry in Australia will be squeezed. Eventually they have to bear the brunt of any taxes or extra imposts that are placed on the industry. The wine makers, particularly the large wine makers, are in a situation where the government can put the squeeze on them. It is the grape growers who will be most effected because they cannot do anything about the prices that they receive for the commodity they produce. The wine makers will be the ones who will eventually decide what price they will pay for that commodity. If they feel they have to squeeze the grape growers, then they will squeeze them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor Government has allied itself to the major wine growers and major wine makers in order to put pressure on the smaller grape growers. I am quite sure&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not funny. I could have mentioned before, when Senator Murphy was talking, the effect the increase in the fuel tax would have on his island state of Tasmania. We know he will vote against it eventually. In South Australia we are particularly concerned because something like 60 per cent of the grapes that are crushed are crushed in South Australia. We are particularly concerned because it is a major industry in South Australia. It is a major industry that is doing well in South Australia. When there is a state that is in the economic situation that South Australia is in and an extra impost is going to be placed on the one industry that looks like it is succeeding and doing well, we find that the economy of South Australia is going to suffer even more greatly than it is at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing the government said in this budget was how this budget was all about jobs. I have read this over and over again and we heard again yesterday that this budget is about jobs. How on earth there is ever going to be any increase in jobs in the wine industry while there is an increase in costs and an increase in tax on the wine industry I am at a loss to understand. It will take this industry some time to recover from the impact this proposal will have on it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion I say that the way the government has handled this whole deal over the past two months, the way that it has blackmailed the industry, the way that it has been heavy handed with the industry and, in particular, with the big wine makers in order to get what it wants from those who it knows can afford to pay, is unacceptable. Some of the big wine makers have admitted that they can afford to pay. It is only the people at the lower end of the scale who are going to suffer. They are the ones that I am particularly concerned about. I am concerned about the Riverland of South Australia where we already have one of the lowest incomes per capita in Australia and struggling grape growers as well as struggling fruit growers. In the Clare Valley and the Barossa Valley many people are suffering because that area has among the lowest income per capita in Australia. The wine industry is undeserving of the extra imposts that will be placed on it. From the start we have been consistent in our opposition to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am so glad Senator Bolkus has reminded me. Senator Bolkus is holding up the election results. I ask Senator Bolkus: when the government went around during the election campaign where did it say it was going to raise the wine tax? Where did it say it was going to raise the fuel tax? Where did it say it was going to raise the wholesale sales tax? It did not say so once. It lied its way into office and it did not have the revenue in order to sustain its promises and so it imposed a whole range of taxes on the Australian economy, taxes which are going to cost jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it goes further than that. We have seen a degree of thuggery, vindictiveness and blackmail. As Senator Lees said, at the end of the day the balance has to be drawn. The wine producers have been singled out for particular attention. In the end it is quite clear from what the major spokespeople in the wine industry have said that they simply have to resolve this issue; it is thus far and no further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a real dilemma. I think Senator Lees and the Greens have put a particular view; we have all wrestled with this problem. It is worth recording the utterly disgraceful behaviour of the Labor Party. On this side of the chamber we are not going to condone blackmail and therefore we will be opposing this particular measure. At the end of the day it is a balance that has to be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has singled out this particular industry. I doubt whether it will ever forget what the Labor Party has done.

It has been absolutely appalling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise a couple of other matters. Not only has the wine industry been hit with these additional taxes; it has been hit with additional fuel taxes. This has been a double barrelled effect. The wine industry has not been singled out for the additional cost that the fuel tax rises will make. Nonetheless, this is an additional cost that the wine industry must bear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a lesson to the whole Australian community that we simply cannot trust members of the Labor Party. They lied their way into office; they were not honest with the people. Now they are faced with the problem of having to raise all this revenue.

If those opposite throw out the largess and make big people of themselves all the time, then, at the end of the day, that has to be paid for. This particular tax is one of the many taxes which have been imposed. I support the remarks of my colleagues. I absolutely abhor the blackmail that the Labor Party has practised in this area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel that some comments ought to be made in relation to this matter before it is finally put to rest one way or other. A good deal has been said about the ramifications of a tax for the wine industry. I will not go over that in detail. I want to concentrate on the position of the Western Australian winegrowers. Initially the position taken by the winegrowers in the west was that they were totally opposed to the proposal of an 11 per cent increase in wine tax. More recently, there have been press reports that the Western Australian winegrowers gave in and agreed with the proposal as put forward by the government today. I wish to advise the Senate that that is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week or so it was put to the Western Australian winegrowers that they should accept the deal struck by the federation with the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). They had no input, no warning. In fact, to my knowledge the only community meeting which has ever been held on this point in the country was held in the south west of Western Australia, at Margaret River, last Sunday. A meeting of more than 100 people, involving community people as well as winegrowers, passed a motion in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Margaret River/Swan Valley, Pemberton members of Great Southern wine communities are philosophically opposed to any increase in wholesale sales tax on wine. However, in the interests of industry stability we are prepared to accept an increase to 22 per cent from 1 November 1993 or at an earlier date if agreed by parliament, provided that an industry inquiry is instituted. No further wholesale sales tax increases are to be implemented without the approval of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That says that because of pressure brought to bear on them and the threat that it would destabilise the industry, they gave in to an increase to 22 per cent only. They did not agree to subsequent increases of two per cent for each year for the next three years. Nor did they agree to any retrospective ratification of an increase to 31 per cent since 17 August this year, when the budget was brought in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the dealings I have had with the growers there&mdash;and I have spoken to the president and a number of other people who were at that meeting in Margaret River last Sunday&mdash;I know that they would welcome an inquiry, but they feel that to increase taxes over the next three years prior to any inquiry or the result of any inquiry is prejudicial, to say the least, and is prejudging the issue in the extreme. In fact, honourable senators will note that in their motion they stated that there should be no further wholesale sales tax increase without the approval of parliament. They have all said to me that they welcome an inquiry. They have no problems with that. They have nothing to hide. But they all stressed to me that they had been coerced into this position. The law of contract states that duress or fraud can void a contract. In this case they had a good deal of duress. They had the threat from the Treasurer saying, `I will impose an excise on you if you do not agree.'</PARA>

That package, which does not form part of this bill but which forms the backdrop to the negotiations to bring it in, holds some inducement to the larger winegrowers because it provides for a capital write-off for acquisition of vines and vineyards.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I put it to the Senate that the interests of the larger winegrowers are different to those of the smaller winegrowers in Western Australia, whom I am here representing and speaking on behalf of today. Western Australia is in an unusual situation because it has so many small winegrowers. I am not criticising the large winegrowers because they want to acquire further vineyards and expand their production. That is natural; it is in the course of things. But I query whether this package is designed to protect the smaller winegrowers or whether it has been designed to induce the larger winegrowers to participate in this package and to bring their fellow winegrowers, the smaller ones, around to agreeing to this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small winegrower was like a grape being caught in a vice. On one side you had the Treasurer saying, `Stand and deliver or I will impose an excise'. On the other side you had other vested interests who had their own reasons for seeing this package come in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I address my comments to the press. I say to them, `Your reports that the Western Australian winegrowers gave in to this package are wrong. You should get your facts right and go back to the drawing board'. What I say to the people who say that the Western Australian winegrowers agree with this package is that they are absolutely wrong. The motion that I have read grudgingly concedes the two per cent increase and freely acknowledges `let us have an inquiry' but it does not go along with a package, or the heads of agreement that was entered into by the federation and the Treasurer. In fact, that motion was passed 98 to 2. All the small winegrowers backed it because they did not see that they had any choice. </PARA>
<PARA>A report which was commissioned by the state government of Western Australia concluded with the following remarks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By increasing the wine tax, growth in the wine industry will be lower. This will set back an industry which is increasingly generating exports and which is a major source of regional rather than centralised growth in Western Australia and Australia. Western Australian wineries which are smaller than those in the eastern states will be particularly vulnerable to reduction in revenue resulting from the tax.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate that whether it be two per cent or 11 per cent, it does not matter. Any increase in the tax on these small wine growers will be disastrous. In fact, as one small winegrower put to me, a bottle of wine has $2 tax on it but a cask of wine has 22c tax on it. It is the larger wine producers who produce the casks of wine. The small wine growers that I am talking about in the south-west of Australia produce bottled wine. Therefore, they suffer an already disproportionate rate of tax compared with cask wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record needs to be set straight. This was a very grubby deal which was put together. Anybody who says that the coalition is being obstructionist needs to look at themselves before they accuse us of being obstructionist in this matter. If others want to go along with grubby deals whereby small wine growers are coerced into agreeing, and if they want to go along with a threat to blackmail them and bring in an excise, let it be on their own heads. For the coalition's part, we see this as a corrupt political exercise whereby the small business men and women have been caught in a vice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say, these people are out of the ordinary because they do a lot more for the community than the average business does. In fact, at that meeting in Margaret River there were people like the refrigeration fellow who supplied the refrigeration on the vineyards and people from the tourist industry. In 1991, in the south-west region of Western Australia $84 million was spent by tourists on overnight stays. They went there mainly because of the vineyards and the pleasant environment that these wine growers have helped to create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the environment, I know that the Green senators would readily acknowledge that these people are also very environmentally conscious in the way they conduct their business. What do they get for it?  They get a stand and deliver approach by the Treasurer. They get coerced into accepting a deal which is totally unfair to them. The considerations which apply to them are different from those applying to the larger winegrowers. The coalition opposes this tax on well considered grounds which we have maintained consistently throughout the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These winegrowers are on the way up. They are trying to establish themselves. They are trying to get a sufficient toehold in the domestic market so that they can export. Eighty per cent of the work force they employ are young people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as an aside, when these winegrowers give their wine away for tastings at the cellar door, they get taxed on that as well. It is great!  They get taxed for giving wine away. </PARA>

<PARA>As I said, I will run through them briefly. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Watson for some of this detail. The first seeks to omit proposed subsection 6AAA(4) from pages 5 and 6 of the schedule. This proposed subsection provides that, where indexation will take effect, the increase in excise duty for petroleum products with a lead content greater than 13 milligrams per litre will be the product of the rate that last applied to those goods and the rate of indexation as published by the statistician plus the amount specified in table 1 in subsection 6AAA(4) of the bill. That would be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is to omit from page 6 of the schedule proposed subsection 6AAA(5). This subsection provides that, where indexation will not take effect, the increase in excise duty for petroleum products with a lead content greater than 13 milligrams per litre will be the sum of the rate that last applied to those goods and the amount specified in table 1 of subsection 6AAA(4) of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third is to omit from pages 6 and 7 of the schedule proposed subsection 6AAA(6). This subsection provides that where indexation will take effect the increase in excise duty for petroleum products with a lead content not exceeding 13 milligrams a litre will be the product of the rate that last applied to those goods and the rate of indexation as published by the statistician, plus the amount specified in table 2 in subsection 6AAA(6) of the act. I think that subsection has already been amended by Senator Harradine's amendment earlier which was to take out item 11(E)(2) from that schedule. As that has already been taken out, I think my amendment can remain in the form that we had earlier contemplated. If surprisingly we get the numbers, the balance of the provisions will be taken out. I think that is the correct interpretation. Certainly that is the advice that I have been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth is to omit from page 7 of the schedule proposed subsection 6AAA(7). This subsection provides that where indexation will take effect the increase in excise duty for petroleum products with a lead content not exceeding 13 milligrams a litre will be the sum of the rate that last applied to those goods and the amount specified in table 2 in subsection 6AAA(6) of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth is the omission from the definition of `indexation period' on page 8 of the schedule, subsections (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) and the substitution of subsections (1), (2) and (3). Section 6AAA(8) defines `indexation period' for the purposes of section 6AAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth is the omission from the definition of `relevant rate' on page 8 of the schedule subsections (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (7) and the substitution of subsection (2) or (3). This amendment modifies the definition of relevant rate for the purposes of section 6AAA. I say to those who do not understand it that if they just vote with us they know they will be getting rid of these awful excise increases! We hope that will give honourable senators greater confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh is the omission of item 10 from page 8 of the schedule. Item 10 amends paragraphs 11(A)(3)(b) of the schedule to the principal act&mdash;that is, gasoline&mdash;by omitting subparagraph (b) and introducing new subparagraphs (b) and (c) to introduce the differentiation between leaded and unleaded gasoline and providing for an increase in the excise duty of 3c per litre for both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eighth is the omission of item 11 from page 8 of the schedule. Item 11 amends paragraph 11(B)(3) of the schedule to the principal act relating to mineral turpentine to increase the excise duty by 3c per litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ninth is the omission of item 12 from page 8 of the schedule. Item 12 amends paragraph 11(C)(2) of the schedule of the principal act, relating to coal tar distillate suitable for use as gasoline substitutes, by omitting paragraph (2) and introducing two new subparagraphs (b) and (c) to introduce the differentiation between leaded and unleaded coal tar, distillates and providing for a 3c per litre increase in the excise for both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend those amendments to the Senate. As I said, they have the effect of removing substantially the increases that the government unwisely seeks to impose on the Australian public. Those increases will substantially add to business costs, detrimentally affect employment and also, as I said in an earlier debate, they will particularly affect the less well off in our community&mdash;the regressive part, again, of this budget. This Labor government does not seem to be particularly concerned if, through its tax changes, it hurts most the poor within our community through its tax changes. This is the chance for the Senate to get rid of these increases. I commend these amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have sought to break the government's item up into, as I said, separate subgroupings in order that the vote might be taken separately on each because there may well be a different result within the Senate on each. I want first to move my amendment No. 10, which has the effect of taking off the government's intended increase of 3c a litre and bringing it back to what it was previously, which was 0.26573c a litre, in relation to automotive diesel oil other than for use in rail or road transport services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might use this opportunity, to save a few minutes further on, to stress the point that, although we want to get excise off rail and off marine&mdash;there is a chance that we might get the numbers tonight to do that&mdash;it is also vitally important that it be taken off other areas as well. I am particularly thinking of road transport. I am thinking of all those small Australian haulage companies that work, I think, in one of the hardest fields. For small business people, they are forced to outlay large capital sums. They work incredible hours. They scrape by in my experience, if they get by at all, and they really need every opportunity to make a living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have the cost of their fuel increased further by this excise represents, I hope, a failure on the part of the government to understand the consequence to such small businesses. I would not have wanted to think the government would do it deliberately.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diesel, as I understand&mdash;others might know better than I&mdash;is an environmentally friendly fuel in any event.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to mention the road haulage industry because it is critically important to a country such as ours, with obviously a large land mass, with cities sparingly placed and with a minimum of rail. I would like to encourage more rail, but obviously there is enormous capital expenditure involved in extending rail. In many cases, as my friend Senator Panizza would confirm, there is no choice but to use road haulage for the purpose of getting product to market or goods and services out to farms and to regional areas. I hope that, on reflection, the committee will recognise that also and will vote down the increase in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others, I think, want to mention other particular industries that will be affected. Senator Tambling might be very keen to make a mention again of some industry in the Northern Territory, vitally dependent on fuel oil, which will be detrimentally affected by these increases.

So it is the consumers at one end and the producers at the other end who will have to pay for it. So their profit margin come down and more people lose their jobs.

If one takes a 10-tonne truck, which uses about 25 litres of fuel to go that 100 kilometres, my estimation is that the increase would mean the trip would cost an additional 75c. Dividing 10,000 kilograms by 75c makes it very hard to make up $3 on a trolley load of food. The figures do not stack up. Would Senator Panizza justify his figures a little further?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A better accountant than I did that calculation of $3 per shopping trolley. That is well documented. I know that the average truck operator, buying in bulk, would pay in the vicinity of 54c a litre. An additional 2c is a one twenty-seventh increase which, to me, without going into finer detail, is roughly a four per cent increase in the cost of fuel. That is a sizeable increase that has to be passed on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief, but there is just one issue that I wish to raise tonight. In question time today, I asked the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, a question regarding the tragic crash of the RAAF Boeing 707 aircraft and subsequent actions taken by the air force to notify pilots of the potential dangers of double asymmetric training. I asked this question because of my concern that there appears to be a misconception that only 707 aircraft are involved in the double asymmetric training when, in fact, Hercules and Orion aircraft also perform this procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his answer to my question, Senator Ray said that the RAAF will upgrade its Boeing 707 flight simulator and that tenders will be called next year. No mention was made of upgrading the Hercules and the Orion simulators and, on contacting Senator Ray's office this afternoon, it was confirmed that the Minister's answer only related to the 707 aircraft. However, I believe that, despite what Senator Ray said earlier today, Hercules and Orion aircraft regularly carry out double asymmetric training. As with the 707 simulator, neither the Hercules nor the Orion simulators are capable of simulating the conditions necessary for double asymmetric training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being from South Australia, I am particularly concerned about this situation as it affects Orion pilots based at the Edinburgh air force base in Adelaide. I certainly do not pretend to be an expert on this topic. However, I am informed that double asymmetric training forms a necessary part of training in emergency procedures for aircraft such as the Orion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated in my question to the minister, Orions regularly fly with one engine shut down to conserve fuel. This is because Orions in their surveillance work cover large distances often over oceans. Naturally, Orions are often flying low and at low speeds. With one engine deliberately shut down, there only needs to be one unplanned engine failure on the same wing for the pilot to need to recall the double asymmetric training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to make this sound overly dramatic but, firstly, if a second engine on the same wing does shut down, perhaps due to a bird strike or something similar, the normal procedure is to relight the other engine&mdash;the one that had been deliberately shut down. Secondly, as we have learned from the Boeing 707 crash, as long as the aircraft does not go below the minimum control speed, there is no reason why it cannot be flown safely. However, for the plane to be flown safely under such circumstances, obviously, the pilot must be familiar with the emergency procedures and the limits of the aircraft&mdash;the most important limit being the minimum control speed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wishing to play down the importance of this issue to 707 and Hercules aircraft, I think it is important to point out that Orion aircraft regularly fly low over water and land and at low speed; they fly long hours over vast distances; and, most importantly, they regularly operate with one engine deliberately shut down. Because of this, it stands to reason that Orions are the aircraft that are most likely to have two engines fail on one wing while they are flying at a low speed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, Australia has 19 Orions which would cost over $100 million each to replace; we also have 24 Hercules worth tens of millions of dollars each. By contrast, I believe we only have five Boeing 707s worth about $8 million each. Orions also have the largest crew of these three aircraft usually carrying 15 flight crew on board plus any passengers; yet there seems to be some doubt that the Orion simulator will also be updated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the RAAF is to improve the standard of double asymmetric training, the same standard must apply across the air force. Otherwise, how can the RAAF justify to Orion pilots that their need for a simulator is less than that of the 707 pilots? What would happen if, several years down the track, an Orion pilot who was prevented from taking part in double asymmetric training, accidentally and through lack of knowledge and practice, let a plane go below its minimum control speed and crashed, killing those on board? When the RAAF is sued by wives of 15 flight crew, how will it justify Boeing 707 pilots being able to practise double asymmetric training in a simulator but Orion pilots not being able to&mdash;and, worse than that, the Orion pilot not having known what to do because he or maybe she had never been allowed to do the training in the air?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very serious questions and, if I have understood Senator Ray's answer to my question correctly, I believe the outcome is most unsatisfactory and I am sure that Orion pilots will be justifiably very angry. To bring the RAAF in line with current practices, both in the military and civilian world, Hercules and Orion simulators must also be upgraded without delay. This will lead to a reduction in the need, or maybe the elimination of the need, for RAAF flight crew to undertake double asymmetric training in the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, while the simulators are being updated, the Minister for Defence and the RAAF hierarchy should ensure that all pilots&mdash;particularly Boeing 707, Orion and Hercules pilots&mdash;are formally notified of the chain of events which led to the tragic crash of the Boeing 707 in 1991. To this extent, I welcome Senator Ray's comments that written and video material is currently being prepared. But I would point out that it has been two whole years since the 707 crash and, as at yet, air force pilots, including those involved in double asymmetric training, have not received formal written advice as to the probable cause of the crash.  This begs the</PARA>
<PARA>question: what if another crash similar to that had occurred during this period or what if one happened tomorrow?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge Senator Ray's comments about the risks of double asymmetric training. But I think this only strengthens the arguments that, firstly, pilots are properly trained in this procedure, which the Boeing crash vividly demonstrates; and, secondly, as acknowledged by overseas Defence Forces and international airlines, it is preferable to practise this procedure in a simulator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while I welcome Senator Ray's statement that tenders will be called for a level 5 simulator for the 707 aircraft, I believe this is only the beginning of the process. There is no doubt that Australia lags behind international standards on double asymmetric training and, until they are all upgraded, the risk of a similar incident is not diminished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The new support arrangements for Woomera and Nurrungar were introduced in response to a Government directive that the Defence Commercial Support Program (CSP) would be implemented in the Woomera township. CSP is a Government initiative aimed at maximising the value for Commonwealth money spent on providing support services to Defence activities. In-House Options, such as that prepared by the Defence Support Centre Woomera, have been encouraged to allow Commonwealth employees to use their expertise to compete against commercial tenderers for CSP work. Encouraging In-House Options also broadens the range of options available to decision makers when awarding this work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The Area Administrator Woomera (AAW) has administered the Nurrungar Support Contract on behalf of the Commonwealth since 20/9/90. Prior to this, the contract was administered by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation at Salisbury, SA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The support contracts at Woomera were awarded using established CSP procedures. Under these procedures, a Source Selection Team studied the various commercial and In-House Options and made a recommendation to the appropriate Department of Defence delegate, the Deputy Secretary, Strategy and Intelligence (DEPSEC S&amp;I). The Woomera Source Selection Team did not include a representative of the Defence Support Centre Woomera so as to ensure no conflict of interest issues arose. The Source Selection Team did, however, seek expert technical assistance from DSCW employees when required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The contract under which SERCo provided support services to Nurrungar was not terminated; it expired on 30 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) The AAW, as the contract administrator and the senior Defence official in Woomera, oversaw the transition to the new contract arrangements. He did so in close consultation with the Defence Contracting Office in Adelaide which provided technical advice throughout the transition period. The AAW also assisted in the resolution of transition-related issues arising between the old contractor, SERCo, and the new contractor, ADI, when required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) &amp; (f) The termination conditions resulting from the expiry of the Nurrungar Support Contract are matters for the company and its employees and are detailed in an industrial agreement between SERCo and the relevant unions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The DSCW submitted its partially successful Preferred In-House Option in accordance with established CSP principles. As stated in (1) above, these principles encourage In-House Options so that Commonwealth employees can use their expertise to compete against commercial tenders for CSP work. In-House Options also broaden the range of options available to decision makers when awarding this work. The Source Selection process under which this work is allocated is designed to minimise the potential for conflicts of interest by separating the decision-making process from the formulation of In-House Options. This was the case at Woomera.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The three year moratorium imposed in 1989 on the manufacture, sale and importation of irradiated food has been extended until the National Food Authority makes a recommendation to the National Food Standards Council on a standard for food irradiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The National Food Authority is in the process of developing a standard for food irradiation which may prohibit or permit either generally or conditionally, the use of ionising radiation to treat food or particular classes of food.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) As all exporting countries and Australian importers are fully aware of the Australian moratorium and of the need to use alternative methods of processing to ensure food meets Australian microbiological standards, it is highly unlikely that irradiated food is available for sale in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Any preservative process applied to food (eg pasteurisation or cooking) will result in changes to its chemical structure and nutritional makeup. Whether changes which may occur as a result of irradiation are unfavourable is the subject of a Review of the Safety and Nutritional Adequacy of Irradiated Food, undertaken by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1992, at the request of the Commonwealth Government. The final report of this review is expected to be published by the WHO at the end of 1993 and will be publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Food irradiation is used to preserve food. Depending upon the dose administered, the effect can range from pest disinfestation, through elimination of storage organisms, akin to pasteurisation, to industrial sterility. Irradiation can destroy micro organisms present in food but it cannot destroy odours, taste or the off-appearance of spoiled food. The process cannot therefore be used to restore or enhance the appeal of foods which have deteriorated beyond saleable condition.</PARA>

The analysis was conducted by the Treasury using the Price, Revenue and Incidence Simulation Model, PRISMOD. The press release, which should be read in conjunction with the model's results, provides a description of the type of Budget measures included in the distributional analysis, the operation of the PRISMOD model and caveats on the interpretation of its results.
