<PARA>What I started to say on the suspension motion is that we have been recalled in farcical circumstances. The government, I think, has forgotten that this is the week before Christmas. This is the week when not only parliamentarians, who are not perhaps of such consequence, but the staff of this place and of the parliament&mdash;the clerks, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the security people, the transport people; and the staff of parliamentarians as well&mdash;have obviously made other arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government set down a legislative program for this particular session. It was due to end last week. In normal circumstances the business of the parliament could have been disposed of within that timetable. However, this government is so determined to get through this piece of legislation, whatever deficiencies might be incorporated within it, it has broken its timetable. It required that the parliament not only sit ridiculous hours last week but sit on Saturday, to the inconvenience of all the parties I have just mentioned&mdash;and now we are dragged back here on the week before Christmas as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the environment within which sound legislative decisions are made. I would have thought that was an understatement. The reason we have been dragged back here is that the government is concerned that what it calls its `fragile consensus' for the Mabo legislation might collapse if there were any delay. Mr President, we made the point last week that a fragile consensus is not a sensible foundation for legislation of this kind; legislation that has within it the potential to create such community disharmony and stress. We said last week that this legislation needed at least a sound foundation and that the government ought to go away and see whether it could build that sound foundation within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that that was a sensible and rational request. We have talked about setting up select committees that would enable the parliament to deal with that in a sensible way; committees that can go out into the community and talk to the people not only about the government's proposed piece of legislation, but also about what the states are either in the process of enacting or have enacted, how both can possibly mesh together and how it would be possible to build within this country a cooperative scheme to deal with native title as has been determined by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Native title as determined by the High Court is not in dispute and the need to comply with Commonwealth legislation such as the Racial Discrimination Act is not in dispute, but there are many management questions that arise out of the High Court decision on Mabo No. 2 that do need to be dealt with through a cooperative federal-state arrangement. If they are not, then uncertainty will continue and it will be at a cost to economic development, particularly pastoral, mining and tourism development. But it will also be at a cost to Aboriginal people who wish to have the concept of native title enacted in statutory law so that how it is to work, how it is to be claimed, how it is to be protected and so forth can be set down in the black letter laws of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret&mdash;I say this with the benefit of hindsight&mdash;that when Mabo No. 2 was put down we did not quite see the difficulties that it would raise. A sensible approach would have been&mdash;as was suggested to the Senate committee by Mr Caston QC&mdash;that the governments of Australia, both federal and state, immediately set up a royal commission and take it out of the political arena. A royal commission could have looked at all the technical, management and social issues that would arise out of Mabo and put a formula to the parliament out of the political environment within which there could be a state and federal program for implementing the changes into statutory law that are necessary as a result of that case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would have been a sensible approach, but apparently it was not thought of and time has gone by. I am still not sure that it might not be the best way to go now. But a royal commission, of course, is outside the hands of the parliament. What the parliament does have is the capacity to set up its own committees that can deal with the detail of these matters. I know that there is some concern that the committees of the parliament are too political&mdash;that they are just part and parcel of the political process. I do not think that is necessarily a weakness; in fact, it can be a strength, because it is the democratic process being implemented in another way. Constituencies express a voice through the parliamentarians in this place and I, for one, am not particularly afraid of that. A properly balanced select committee set up by this chamber, which has a fine record in these matters, would have had the opportunity, as I said, to go out into rural and regional Australia and talk to those who are most affected by Mabo No. 2 and to come back to this parliament with recommendations as to how Mabo No. 2 might be most effectively implemented through statutory law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government was not prepared to do that. The only reason is that it has said that Mr Keating has conducted his own process of inquiry. He has called upon and brought in only those whom he believes it is necessary for him to listen to. He has come to a determination on that basis. He is determined to ram that decision through the parliamentary process because otherwise there is a certain loss of face to him. That is an unsatisfactory way to do things. We all know that what he would like to do with this chamber is just have us act as a rubber stamp in these circumstances, but we are not prepared to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is not too late for the parliament to adjourn this matter, take it out of this farcical environment in which it is now placed and set up a select committee. This select committee could be properly representative of this chamber and therefore of the various viewpoints within the Australian community. This committee would have the capacity to commission expert advice; call upon such specialists as may be necessary to deal with the highly complex legal questions that this chamber has been wrestling with over the last few sitting days; deal with the problems of maintaining social cohesion through such a traumatic experience as seems to be developing in this process; and deal with the economic questions that will arise out of the fact that the title of pastoral leases is under question. There is uncertainty in future mining developments, which is not in the national interest at a time when we are trying to pull this country out of recession and provide jobs for the almost one million unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these matters could be dealt with in a sensible, rational way by calling upon the best possible advice that is available out there in the community; objective advice that is outside the parliamentary process but which can be brought into that process by means of a select committee of this parliament. Would that not be a sensible, rational way to deal with this matter? When this parliament meets again in early February&mdash;which is only two months away&mdash;the debate would be based upon better facts and better legal advice, and those uncertainties would be removed. I would hope that out of that process could come a legislative result that would be very much more in the interests of the Australian people than what we are getting&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the point being made is that the family is meeting at the end of the room again; that is, the three principal factions&mdash;the ALP, the Australian Democrats and the Greens. They are deciding whether to foist this on the Australian people today, even though what we know has occurred over the weekend is that the fragile consensus has collapsed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining community has now abandoned this process. The rural community has abandoned this process. The states are abandoning this process. I wonder whether the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) heard Premier Goss on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> radio this morning. Everyone recognises that this farce is leading only to bad law and the potential for social and community stress. What is occurring in this place today is not in the national interest&mdash;and the government knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a simple plea at this late stage to those that I hope could be a little independent of this government and little more rational and sensible than this government that is, of course, being driven by the ego of Mr Keating. I ask the Democrats and the Greens: Are they interested in sensible process? Are they interested in good quality law? Are they interested in social cohesion? Or do they want to put all those at risk by a process that has developed, as I said, into no more than a farce?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may be their last chance to get it right. I just say to them that they should take this last chance and say, `We want to end this silly nonsense and the harm that is being done to the staff and to the spirit of the parliament'. They should bring this to an end and allow us to do our job properly within reasonable time constraints. This is their chance. We will see now whether the Greens and the Democrats, having reflected upon the collapse of the so-called fragile consensus over the weekend, are now prepared to accept their national responsibility and support this motion. Let us do things in a sensible way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This attempt by the coalition is yet another example of how it wants to delay the substantive business of this house. It continues the tradition of the first three weeks in this parliamentary sittings when we had hardly five hours of dealing with substantive legislation. All the coalition is doing is obstructing and wasting time. The reality is that we have started to debate this bill constructively; amendments have been moved and have been either rejected or accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind the coalition that the Australian Democrats opposed the government's amendment to clause 24. If coalition senators had really wanted to get that principle up on behalf of the pastoralists and the mining industry, they should have joined the three National Party senators who crossed the floor. But they did not. They might now realise their mistake, but that is no reason to hold up the further consideration of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to get into this legislation and deal with it substantively. Aboriginal people have waited long enough. It is time that we did something to put a base of justice in our dealings with the Aboriginal community. If the coalition thinks it will tire us out, I believe that it has made a wrong judgment. This is one bill where an endurance test will work against the coalition. It has simply picked the wrong bill. If necessary, we will sit until New Year's Eve. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion, moved before the resumption of the committee of the whole on the bill, to provide for the reference of proposed amendments to the Native Title Bill 1993 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>If we ignore for the moment the sort of ideological response we get from the Senator Spindlers of this world, who want to pretend that nothing has changed over the weekend, we find that there have been some critical developments in this debate which make it abundantly clear that no-one, including the government, has the least idea of the legal implications of these clauses. We have already had three separate clauses deferred for further consideration. We have had the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) indicating that amendments are being drafted but that he cannot foreshadow them at this stage. Now we have an indication that the Democrats may be looking at further amendments. In other words, we are being asked to give a blank cheque to one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to come before this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position of the National Farmers Federation is a classic example of the dangers involved in proceeding any further down this path. Two weeks ago, the National Farmers Federation, and Mr Farley in particular, was arguing that the bill, unamended, had to be supported in the best interests of all concerned&mdash;presumably that included farmers and miners&mdash;and therefore there was no need for any amendments. Now we find that when the Democrats' refusal to support a particular amendment results in that amendment being defeated, the National Farmers Federation withdraws its support for the legislation, arguing that it creates too much uncertainty about land title and rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no-one out there, apart from the ideologues, who would argue that this legislation is sufficiently clear in purpose and intent to be allowed to proceed in its present form. We still have heaps of amendments to deal with. We still do not understand the full implications of them. The government can do its best on the run, but, as we have seen on three separate occasions, the government has had to defer consideration&mdash;on the second occasion on the initiative of Senator Chamarette, who, of her own volition, acknowledged that it would be wrong to proceed further with debate on that particular clause. In other words, there is an acknowledgment on both sides of the chamber that there are very great dangers in proceeding to deal with matters in the dark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether Senator Chamarette heard what I said; it is very important that we all appreciate this. After the government had been forced to defer consideration of one clause and we came to another clause, Senator Chamarette actually got up and moved that we defer consideration of that clause as well. All parties agreed with that. That is a classic indication that on both sides of the chamber there is an acknowledgment of the dangers involved in trying to get these things right on the run. In those circumstances, what is critically important, if those opposite are interested in fairness and justice, if they are interested in not just squeezing out&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anyone in this chamber is interested in fairness and justice and ensuring that any bill that goes through this parliament has the effect intended, surely those opposite would have to agree that the legal implications of this matter need further consideration. This morning, when Premier Goss was asked whether the deal was falling apart, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we're certainly very worried. I've got officers urgently trying this morning to find out what the hell is going on in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA>Later, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we understand there is hundreds of amendments or hundreds of pages of amendments being introduced into the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We may have to bail out of the process.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we're quite concerned that the whole package might be going off the rails.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have someone who was hitherto a strong supporter of the legislation. We have had Mr Farley, who made a fool of himself in front of the nation by giving a blank cheque to the bill, now realising that it needs amendments&mdash;amendments so vital that he has withdrawn support for the bill because the very same amendments for which he did not see a need two weeks ago have not gone through. So we have a situation where even one of the government's strongest supporters now recognises that it is absolutely imperative that the legal consequences of these amendments be exposed to further consideration. I know that honourable senators opposite do not give a damn about that; they are only interested in getting any bill through at any time. We are not. We are here to see that the matter is properly and carefully considered. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Mr President, you should point out to him that this is not a re-run of the previous motion. The previous motion was in relation to the whole of the Native Title Bill. This is in relation to the legal implications of certain amendments which have not yet been voted on. In those circumstances, we cannot possibly proceed on the basis that this is a repetitious motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Then, Mr President, let me deal with the terms of this motion, since it appears that we will be debating it for what is left of the half-hour. I have only this to say: there is no justification for adjourning the whole debate on the basis of a proliferation of amendments. We already have before us in the chamber all remaining government amendments we propose to move in the course of this debate&mdash;save and except for the possibility that it might be necessary to later respond in a corrective way to something not yet foreseen. I do not expect that to be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only three remaining government amendments before us. The first is government amendment No. 75 on the body corporate question, which goes to a number of different clauses but with the same basic theme. The second is government amendment No. 69A, which relates to clause 238. The third government amendment is No. 50A relating to clause 208. There are a number of Green and Democrat amendments in circulation. I believe that just about every amendment proposed to be circulated has already been circulated and we have all had ample opportunity to look at them. There is simply no substantive justification for what opposition senators are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the extraneous material that has been introduced by Senator Alston I simply say this: it is the case that as of two or three weeks ago the National Farmers Federation and similar groups were content with the terms of the Native Title Bill. However, they have since decided that they want further reassurance of a belt and braces kind in relation to two or three clauses. Also, a couple of problems were shown up by the Senate standing committee inquiry, particularly the definitional problem about water and the onshore application of the bill. It was necessary to clarify industry concerns about the water matter. While it was not necessary, it was, in our judgment, desirable to clarify industry concerns about clause 24 and related matters.

I made it absolutely clear and the government made it absolutely clear at all relevant stages of the discussion that we wanted this amendment, that we wanted the Democrats to vote for it, and that we would take whatever risk was associated with that amendment when it came to the third reading vote.

Any reasonable person would have seen that it was in the interests of the mining industry to pass the clause relating to the amendment to the arbitral process which the opposition served to defeat. Any reasonable and sensible person would have seen that it was manifestly in the interests of the legislation to pass the clause 24 pastoral industry and mining industry provision which the opposition&mdash;which the Liberals&mdash;again served to defeat.

So these matters are postponed and postponed because the government does not realise the consequences of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way the government will comprehend the consequences is by giving these amendments some decent consideration.

He has admitted the existence of that escape door and, despite acknowledging problems, he has left his colleagues to come out and say, `This bill is right'. Senator Gareth Evans sat here on Friday and Saturday.

The government will not fall in January: it will have the numbers in the House of Representatives. Labor members would not dare do anything other than what their leader told them. Their leader talks about forelock tugging. There is a lot of forelock tugging going on now with government members competing for the position of Treasurer. They all want to be Treasurer.

We would like to know how long the government intends that this farce should continue? Are we staying here after Christmas? What is the government's plan? Clearly, there is an enormous amount of work before the chamber. How many hundreds of amendments are still to be debated? I understand there are more amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I have every confidence that, if we do not waste any more time in the way we did this morning, given the number of substantive issues which remain&mdash;which are not impossibly large in number even though there are, of course, a great many amendments&mdash;a great many of the amendments are in fact technical in character and will not detain us. So far as the government is concerned, the government amendments are, as I said&mdash;subject to anything that I do not know about at the moment and cannot anticipate&mdash;all before the opposition as proposed on the original running sheet, with three additional ones that were the subject of separate circulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has before it I think just about all the amendments that I am aware of that are likely to be moved by the Greens and the Australian Democrats. Senator Hill fulminated a moment ago about another Green amendment&mdash;No. 33(b). If he looks carefully, he will see that it is exactly the same as 33(a) that was circulated yesterday; it has just had a change of letter to avoid possible confusion with an earlier amendment circulated either Thursday night or Friday morning and to avoid the possibility of confusion when we come to that in the debate. So it is exactly the same thing; just with a different letter on the top right-hand corner. One or two other smaller matters may emerge over the next couple of days, but basically I can say quite frankly and honestly that, to my knowledge, the chamber has in front of it just about all the material&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;About 98 per cent&mdash;how is that for `just about'? The opposition has about 98 per cent of the material it needs, and certainly any relevant material that may come in will be needed for items or clauses that will be reached much later in the debate. Under those circumstances&mdash;given the fact that the opposition has all the material and given that the number of substantive debates that remain are probably no more than 15 or 20 when we look at the different subject matter&mdash;I believe it is perfectly reasonable, in view of the time we have left today and the time we have tomorrow, to think in terms of concluding this debate in the Senate by dinnertime tomorrow. That is our intention; that is our target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are discussions taking place about the possibility of having a more orderly debate in order to secure that particular result with that as the target. I do not know whether it will be possible to reach agreement about that, but there are a great many hours of debate left today, tonight and through until the dinner break tomorrow&mdash;a great many hours. It is perfectly possible to contemplate an orderly debate of all substantive issues that need to be debated during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no agreement, although there are some discussions taking place. If the opposition is prepared to contribute to those discussions in the rational and constructive fashion that, despite its public posturing, it has shown on occasion in discussions about the process I have had outside this chamber; if we get some of the cooperation on the subject of orderly process that has been apparent privately from Senator Alston and Senator Hill, whatever honourable senators opposite say and carry on about publicly; if they are prepared to do publicly what they do privately and if they are prepared privately, perhaps in the next couple of hours, to help us a little more to get some order into this debate; then we can have some rational process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of quick introduction, can I say that I am constantly appalled at the way in which Senator Kernot thinks that discussion in this chamber is superfluous and that the real action is outside.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not in the business of promoting a filibuster. That has always been our position. We have therefore taken steps over a period of days to try to organise our program and our response in a considered and orderly way. We have nominated a number of people with special areas of responsibility to ensure that there is not unnecessary duplication and to make sure everyone contributes in a constructive way. I have a list here which I could show Senator Evans to give him an indication of that. It has the government's amendments grouped by subject matter, and we have allocated them to a number of individual senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made every attempt to ensure that the debate takes place in a constructive manner. I would have thought even Senator Evans would have the grace to concede that&mdash;even though Senator Kernot apparently does not think anything ought to be taking place in this chamber. I heard Senator Evans give credit to Senator Ellison the other day. We have raised matters which I think have led to a much higher standard of debate than is often the case in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that there is often the temptation for people on both sides of the chamber to just rabbit on; to wander in and make a contribution which covers precisely the same ground as others. Therefore, in terms of our position, I make it perfectly clear that we have never indicated that we expected or wanted the debate to be concluded by a particular point. We certainly did not want to truncate the debate. But we did want to ensure that no-one could accuse us of filibustering and that any contributions that were made, were made after proper consideration in particular specialised areas. That is what we have done to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the calibre of the contributions has been extraordinarily high, which reflects the seriousness of our attitude toward this bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Similarly, I have no aspirations. I go where my party takes me. Can I quickly say in response to Senator Alston that I acknowledge that the great majority of the debate we have had so far on the substantive issues has been fair enough. They have been difficult and complex issues which have required questions. It has been appropriate to seek information and responses and I think the debate has been conducted at a reasonably decent level so far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do want to say that a lot of the issues that we have debated go to the heart and core of the substantive issues involved in the legislation. It is perfectly possible, given the way in which the clauses are constructed, for a number of those issues to be raised on almost infinite occasions over the course of the next two days or more, if the decision were to be taken by the non-government parties to embark upon a general filibuster in an attempt to talk this out. Naturally, the government would be concerned at any sign of that happening and would wish to take steps accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, quite apart from that concern, there might be some virtue in structuring a debate around those clauses which do obviously demand detailed further consideration, with less time being devoted to those clauses which obviously do not demand that further consideration because they have not been the subject of any foreshadowed amendment or opposition. We will certainly continue to explore the possibility for a more rational ordering of this, bearing in mind the many hours that are left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are many other ways of wasting time and protracting proceedings than by filibustering on the particular substantive clauses. The procedural debate we had this morning, these personal exchanges and so on are obviously further contributions to that. We have already wasted an hour and a half of substantive debating time. Might I express the hope of this side of the chamber, and make a request to those on the other side, that they do understand the seriousness of purpose of the government in getting this legislation through; they do understand our determination to get it through this week; they do understand our willingness equally to debate substantively all the issues that need to be debated; and they will understand in all those things and will cooperate in at least getting a final result on this by the time we rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are perfectly prepared to sit further than beyond tomorrow night, should that prove to be necessary. We are absolutely determined to get this legislation by Christmas and we will take whatever steps necessary to do it.

When that amendment was put around the Senate on Saturday it had the notation 33A which did produce confusion because senators had both a short amendment and a long amendment with the 33A notation on it. The 33B notation has been put on the longer version. There is clearly a difference between those two. The only amendment that is relevant, as I understand it, is the one marked 33B.

If we have the opportunity along the way we will go through all the errors that he made in giving answers to questions. We are far from understanding what the issues are to be settled.

The government is presently disposed towards supporting the Greens amendment, subject as always to the way in which the debate goes.

They have said from day one that they are adopting an attitude of total hostility to it.

It is simply a matter of this being the only legislative process available to us. We are a legislature; we have to put together the numbers to deal with things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a discussion this morning about clause 11. As the minister will recall; when this matter was first raised with him, the initial question put to him was whether he had sought any legal advice with respect to this matter. As I understand it, the minister made some remarks about not having checked the archives. But he clearly indicated that in recent times the government did not see a problem with the operation of clause 11 of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that, because we on this side think there is a serious problem with clause 11, a number of matters were raised: whether it could be void due to uncertainty; its application vis-a-vis state laws; the mistakes that were made with the Racial Discrimination Act in terms of not understanding section 109; and that, despite the fact that the minister has raised some examples where the Commonwealth has adopted common law, as I understand it he was not able to raise an example of where the Commonwealth has adopted common law using the words of section 109, `the force of law of the Commonwealth'. That is a distinction I think we had some difficulty getting through. I am not trying to have this debate now; I am just trying to list for the minister the points that&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister raised some examples where the common law is incorporated by definition or for convenience sake by using the law of the states, but not an example where it has been by section 109. Subsequently, another case has come to mind&mdash;I think it is called In re Uren&mdash;where the court held that a law has to be enacted for it to have the force of the law of the Commonwealth. The question is raised then whether that simple one line saying that we give the common law the force of law of the Commonwealth is enough because that may not enact the Commonwealth law. In re Uren&mdash;and I invite the Minister to have a look at it&mdash;might actually mean that we do have to codify in statute any law before it is able to overtake state laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister obviously knows a lot more about this than I do because he has raised the question. There has been an ongoing debate about whether we can have state and federal common law. This particular case argued that, if we were to say that a body of Commonwealth common law existed, it would not be possible to use that under 109 to override a state statutory law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, a number of serious issues with respect to clause 11 have been raised. Accepting the fact that the minister either did not see those issues or think they have the importance we think they have, has he, subsequent to those matters being raised, sought some legal advice? Will he agree, prior to this matter coming back on, to give all members of the parliament the opportunity to see that legal advice well in advance so that, when we do come to clause 11, we will not just go through a rehash of `You think this; I think that' but we will use all the resources available to the parliament to inform ourselves as to the operation of clause 11?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask that not just because it would be a sensible way to proceed with the debate&mdash;and obviously it would be more informed&mdash;but, as the minister presumably understands, if he loses on clause 11 in the High Court of Australia, he has lost the whole thing. So it is a vitally important and central aspect of this bill that was dealt with at some length&mdash;and then postponed. I would not want other senators to think that this was just some flippant constitutional issue. This goes to the very guts of the bill. This is similar to the regulations in the Australia Card&mdash;bingo, we lose those, we lose the whole bill. This matter is in the interests of the whole chamber. So I ask: has the minister sought legal advice? If he has not, will he, and will he share that legal advice with the parliament?</PARA>

So I table it now, and that is available for circulation immediately. While tabling that, I also table for circulation information about reservations in state statutes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just hope that some of the people who are supporting this bill consider what they will do if it is struck down. I put to Senator Evans that, if he is going to put together bits of the advice for us to look at, presumably in anticipation of litigation, he will not include the bits that create doubt. So what he gives us will be, quite frankly, less than balanced and perhaps not as useful as it might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand how on plenty of occasions governments have said that they need to keep advice for a whole variety of reasons&mdash;and perhaps in anticipation of litigation is an accepted one. I do not think it is. But on this occasion, I put to the minister that he take back to his colleagues the view that, because this piece of legislation is so important&mdash;and as he says there is some urgency to get it through&mdash;they need to get it through and they need it to be valid. There is no point in getting it through and it not being valid. In fact, it would be just a disaster with the minister giving longer time for what he might call `the forces of darkness' to come out against this bill. That is what the government will do if it passes invalid legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, I would have thought that, if we want to sort these problems out and if the government is determined to have this particular response to Mabo No. 2 rather than another one, it is in the government's interest, in the interests of those who want this particular piece of legislation&mdash;I do not; I think there is another way to go&mdash;to put that advice on the table so we can see the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is sure that this is the appropriate response, let us see the legal advice that the government has so that we on this side can make a judgment. I know that Senator Evans will say, `You've already made up your mind'. But what about letting some other constitutional experts&mdash;the wider legal profession&mdash;look at this and make an assessment as to whether we are raising clause 11 as some form of delay in the debate or whether there is a genuine fundamental problem with this bill. The government would be better to find that out sooner rather than later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some questions with respect to clause 25. As I understand it, clause 25(1) under subdivision B applies if a `government party', after commencement of the subdivision, proposes to do any permissible future act under clause 25(2) in relation to an onshore place. I want to make a number of points about this. Firstly, a government party presumably includes a state. As a consequence of this, the Commonwealth law imposes a restriction on the ability of states to do permissible future acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, to find out what is a permissible future act&mdash;departmental officials may be able to advise the minister if I have this comprehensively right&mdash;one would have to look at clauses 220, 218, 219, 211, 212 and 227. That surely highlights one aspect of the complexity of this bill; that is, it is necessary to understand at least six other clauses of definitions, totalling almost three pages, in order to understand the term `permissible future act' in clause 25(1). Do I misunderstand, or is it the situation that some poor soul who is trying to get to the bottom of what can be done vis-a-vis clause 25(1) has to look at all of the clauses I mentioned?</PARA>

We are talking here about one of the central, pivotal clauses of the whole bill defining as it does the acts that are covered. Yes, it is the case that, in order to get a full understanding of how those acts are defined, one does need to go to all those other definitional provisions to which Senator Vanstone referred. That is in the nature of any complex piece of legislation. Try a tax act on some of these sorts of issues and see how complex that gets.

We certainly would not envisage that delay being anything like the full nine months for which the bill makes provision. I am advised that there is still a chance that the bill as a whole could be proclaimed, but I do not over-emphasise that because there are obviously quite a few hurdles yet to jump over.

For example, with clauses 21 and 22 in place, any mining or other relevant interest that was granted after 1 January would have to be granted on the principle that it could be done only in relation to native title if it could be done in respect to freehold title.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the minister is taking advice I make the point that it is all very well for people such as Senator Spindler to come in here with his heart on his sleeve and announce to the world that Aboriginal people have waited too long. That may well be the case but we do them no service by rushing through by Christmas a bill that ends up being unconstitutional or that they cannot work anyway because the rest of the things involved are not in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make the point&mdash;now that I have thought of it, I am slightly annoyed&mdash;that a certain type of sanctimony has been engaged in throughout this debate by parties all over the place&mdash;in particular, from the Australian Democrats who regularly say in their speeches, `Those of us who care about the rights of indigenous Australians'. The clear inference they are trying to make on a broadcast day is that others who do not agree with them&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, but the sign said `broadcast' and I assumed therefore that it was a broadcast day. Senator Kernot said it today, as she did the other day, in the hope it would be repeated. The Democrats can wear their hearts on their sleeves and run around saying, `We care about indigenous Australians, so it follows from that that everything we say is correct, everything we say is going to be held in place, everything we do is going to be constitutional and all the trappings to make this bill work will do so'. We are not talking about just getting a bit of coverage here and being the people who passed or did not pass the Native Title Bill. In the end this bill will go out into the legal marketplace and be used by people&mdash;and they have to have some idea how to go about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is important for us to know whether the regulations, the tribunal and all these other things are ready. Otherwise, all the Democrats' wearing their hearts on their sleeves looks horribly shallow. It is just an opportunity to get themselves a bit of media coverage and make a few digs at people who happen to have a different view from them as to the way things ought to proceed. Rather than puffing a whole lot of air about their good intentions, they would be better extending their minds to a bit of detail on the bill and contributing to the detailed discussion of it to try to tease out the problems, giving people an opportunity to fix them. That is why I asked the question: what work has gone into the establishment of the tribunal? Without it, obviously, there will be consequences for people using the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an issue we have debated already. The whole point of this particular provision about validation of past invalid acts is to, with a sweep of the legislative pen, validate any past act that may be invalid for the particular reason spelt out in the legislation, namely, the interaction of the existence of native title with some other law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of this is to give certainty right now, instantly, to anyone who believes it is conceivably possible that their particular interest might have been invalidated perhaps because it was granted after 1975 and in an area where there was very likely to be native title but no attention was paid to that possibility, as indeed it could not have been realistically because native title, of course, had not been identified by the High Court as being there. But there is just that question mark which exists&mdash;we have talked about it often enough in this chamber in question time; we have talked about it earlier in this debate. That is the reason. It does not depend upon any prior determination of invalidity or the non-existence of native title by the tribunal or anyone else, and that is the reason for it. It is a clarifying provision saying, `Anything which might be invalid is hereby validated'. The Commonwealth does that; it makes it possible for the states to do that in each of their own areas and that is one of the central themes of the legislation&mdash;to clarify that particular issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The validation impact of Division 2 can certainly apply straight away without the tribunal getting up, for the reasons that I have said. To the extent that someone wants to pursue a compensation claim arising out of that&mdash;and a compensation claim will depend on a determination of actual invalidity before one can get started&mdash;then the tribunal will have to be in effect. Realistically, the pursuit of a claim of that kind is some little time away, some months away, and certainly by then the tribunal would be in effect.

Senator Vanstone pointed out to the minister that, to get a definition of permissible future acts, we had to look at clauses 220, 218, defining respectively, `Permissible future act' and `Future acts'; 219, `Low impact future act'; 211, `Act'; 212, `Act affecting native title'; and 227 being a `lease' as set out in clause 219, the meaning of a `low impact future act'.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Alston then pointed out to Senator Evans quite clearly that subclause 227(c) on page 106 specifically says that anything described as a lease is deemed to be a lease whether it is the legal effect of the lease or not. In saying that this act gives certainty, the minister in charge, has again misled us&mdash;I have a whole list of instances where he has misled us in his answers&mdash;and has indicated that he does not comprehend or understand the act itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I can now go on and debate clause 25 and point out just how bad it is, before lunch we were highlighting the ineptitude of the manner of drafting&mdash;evidenced by the use of a term such as `permissible future act'. Presumably, the word `permissible' has been used because the draftsman is attempting to indicate that what is permissible with regard to native title is similar to what is permissible with regard to holders of freehold title. But that proves not to be the case at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 25, via clause 25(2), applies basically to mining and compulsory acquisition. It describes the types of acts that will have to go to a tribunal. As Senator Vanstone so adequately pointed out before lunch, that tribunal is not established. We do not have the criteria, as set out, as to who shall people it and how it shall operate. We are now told that on and by 1 January&mdash;the minister said, `With a bit of hope and luck, life is like that'; near enough is good enough&mdash;we might have one registry operating in Canberra. Canberra is pretty remote from the rest of Australia, but with a bit of hope and luck&mdash;that is what he said&mdash;we might have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians think that is totally inadequate, just as they think that a `permissible future act' has to be defined by reference to no less than six other sections is inadequate. A thorough working knowledge of what is meant by a lease is required by&mdash;the minister has already demonstrated that he does not understand it&mdash;and is the responsibility of every person who wants to operate in areas of exploration and to add to the wealth of this country in a way in which all Australians can share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 25(2) states that, subject to subsection 3, the acts which are permissible future acts&mdash;which are retrospective&mdash;are in respect of, firstly, the creation of a right to mine. That seems to be a pretty straightforward statement until the definition of `mine' in the definition section is read. The definition of `mine' is:</PARA>

That is par for the course from Senator Bishop. The language used here is very straightforward&mdash;`the creation of a right to mine, whether by grant of a mining lease or otherwise'. There are various ways in which these interests, whether they be formal mining leases or whether they be exploration licences or permits of various kinds, can be granted. Sometimes a full-scale mining right, for example, can be granted by way of legislation, with some specific purpose legislation for a particular mine in a particular location. All of these things are perfectly, readily ascertainable as a matter of straight commonsense statutory interpretation. There is hardly any need to spell that out.

It is a point that is of no particular utility to make, other than for posturing purposes, but then we are familiar with that.

If airborne exploration involved a specific permit to be conducted, presumably that particular permit would come within the scope of the act as a prima facie matter. But, if an activity involves merely airborne activity and not on the ground seismic activity or things of that kind, even the impairment of the native rights would be so comprehensively insignificant, so insubstantial and so totally marginal in their obvious impact that, for that reason alone, they would be excluded from the operation of the legislation the way it is drafted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very short point, and I have made it already before, is that a future act to come within the scope of this legislation has to, within the meaning of 218(1)(c)(i), affect native title. It has to affect native title before the legislation even begins to bite upon the act in question and before anyone has to make any judgment at all about the nature and extent of that impact which would have been, as I have already said, negligible. But here it cannot be construed by itself, from any rational perspective, as amounting to affecting native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is quite different from a situation where a mining lease is granted or where an exploration permit even is granted which involves perhaps very substantial physical intrusion into the area of the native title and some significant impact in that respect on the enjoyment of that title. When Senator Bishop talks simply of aerial surveying, it is only in the loosest terms that that would be regarded as being included in the definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My definition that I will be moving in clause 71 does introduce some content to the notion of `explore'. We did that at the request of the state government of Victoria. It says that `explore' means to conduct a geological, geophysical or geochemical survey or take samples for the purpose of analysis. There are some forms of geophysical surveys, as well as geological and geochemical ones, that would involve an impact or an effect on native title. There are other kinds&mdash;purely aerial surveys and so on&mdash;that would not be construed by any reasonable observer, or certainly any reasonable court or tribunal, as having that impact. A filing of a flight plan pursuant to some regulatory arrangement by the CAA is an example of drawing an absurdly long bow. It might give the honourable senator something to occupy the time of the chamber with for yet another few minutes, but it is not something that could rationally be regarded as impacting on native title, and therefore not rationally within the scope of the legislation. </PARA>

So let us be very precise: seismic studies are also done by aircraft and are certainly intrusive even under the minister's secondary definition. The Civil Aviation Authority is in fact bouncing waves off the surface, and it fits within the government's definition of `geophysical'. It is the government's definition and the government's bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily. They may be, given the terms of the particular mining lease, which are often quite inclusive of provisions of that kind. But there are other ways in which these rights can be granted. For a start, the concept of permissible future acts is of course a reference to those acts which are able to be set in train in relation to freehold land, applying the freehold test: if freehold land can be the subject without more activity by state, territory or Commonwealth governments, equally that activity can occur over land which is the subject of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also add that state mining acts do provide the detailed rights which tend to be associated with the granting of mining leases or different kinds of lesser interests in land that are associated with mining or pre-mining activity. Our legislation does not intrude into that particular domain at all. It is meant to be no more than a reference to it. I am reminded further that the definition of `mine' is itself inclusive rather than exclusive. It does not purport to cover the whole field of possible scope of mine activity. To the extent that state mining legislation has something to say on that subject, that would also no doubt be taken into account by any court or tribunal where this matter came as an issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That of course invokes the provisions of clause 11, about which we are still to have debate. But, nonetheless, I had a reason for mentioning right at the beginning the concept that a permissible future act was meant to denote that the same sorts of things could be done with respect to native title as could be done with respect to freehold title. That is a misnomer because Aboriginal title will give the proprietors of that land the right to exclude people from that land. That is the whole point we are discussing in clause 11. Despite clause 11, they will still have the right to exclude people from their land. That means that, although under this legislation we may be given the right to mine, under the minister's very explanation to me minutes ago, we do not necessarily have the right to the ancillary requirements of that mine.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 36, page 20, line 36, omit "must not", substitute "may".</PARA>
<PARA>As I understand it, we are debating cognately clauses 25 to 39. If there are other matters on other clauses, I am sure there will be time left for people to discuss them. This amendment refers to subclause 36(2). The Greens have always held the position that the Native Title Bill should not bring Aboriginal rights lower than those granted under the High Court decision, nor should it close off avenues that the High Court may decide in the future. The legislation is already doing just that, particularly in the area of mineral rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States of America and Canada, mineral ownership has often been found to be an integral part of native title and native title confers the right to control overdevelopment on native title land. This bill, and particularly this clause, closes off those options for Aboriginal people. This clause closes those doors by preventing native titleholders from sharing in any resource profits from their native title land. This will deprive many Aboriginal groups of their right to economic independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a signatory to international treaties that protect human rights and the cultures of indigenous people. The preamble to this legislation specifically states that the bill is intended to be consistent with those international conventions&mdash;such as the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Shortly we will be asked to sign the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. But to survive culturally, Aboriginal people require a strong economic base. This clause reduces the economic rights of Aboriginal people. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arbitral body must not determine a condition under paragraph (1)(c) that has the effect that native title parties are to be entitled to payments worked out by reference to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the amount of profits made; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) any income derived; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) any things produced;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">by any grantee party as a result of doing anything in relation to the land or waters concerned after the act is done.</PARA>
<PARA>Mark that well, because whatever development is occurring on that land is being done on native title land. Yet here we have in this bill, which is aimed at preserving native title rights&mdash;at least to the extent which they were given by the High Court and not undermining them&mdash;a clause that specifically writes out any basis for which Aboriginal people may receive advantage from the usage to which their native title land is put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause puts the bill in complete contradiction to the Northern Territory Land Rights Act and the New South Wales Land Rights Act, both of which allow control over development and royalty sharing of some sort. The Northern Territory government has already indicated that it intends to use this clause as a lever to change the Northern Territory Land Rights Act so that Northern Territory Aborigines will lose the right of veto. Is it the intention of this clause to open a pathway for erosion of the rights of Northern Territory Aboriginal people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of these factors, and the fact that this clause specifically goes against the draft UN declaration of the rights of indigenous people, the Greens are opposed to it as it stands and are proposing an amendment. The amendment simply leaves it open. It does not decide the matter but neither does it explicitly exclude the possibility that some form of negotiation may be entered into. It may well be in the interests of mining companies and those developers that seek to gain access to native title land that they have the freedom to be able to negotiate; and that some of the royalty benefits may accrue to the rightful traditional owners of that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I have presented and moved this amendment. I hope that the opposition is listening because, in the interests of justice, Aboriginal people have an entitlement not to be specifically excluded from this measure. As I understand it, the government is not prepared to support it. However, I would very much like to hear the minister's reasons for not supporting such a change or even for including such a clause which I believe is a discriminatory one within the confines of this legislation which is supposed to be preserving the rights of native title owners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to try to explain to Senator Chamarette why the government does not feel it is able to go down this path. I have already done so to some extent on an earlier amendment that was moved. In a sense, this is a second bite of the cherry. Maybe I can be a little more explicit the second time around on the problems that this gives rise to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, I think it needs to be appreciated that other property owners&mdash;apart from the situation that may exist in relation to Aboriginal title&mdash;are not entitled in any way to profit related payments when they do not have title to the minerals. The generally understood situation in this country is that ownership of minerals is reserved to the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court judgment made no mention of native titleholders owning minerals. It is unresolved as to whether it is possible for them to do so. It seems unlikely to the government that a decision of that kind would be made, not least because modern methods of extraction which are necessary to get to most ore bodies and to produce returns from most kinds of mining activity are clearly rather beyond the kinds of interests that were referred to in the High Court judgment. Our position is that it would be very difficult to justify making potentially available profit related payments to native titleholders when holders of other kinds of property interests which may be comparable in all sorts of ways simply do not get such payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of parenthesis, if it were the case that the High Court held at some time in the future that native title does extend to minerals, the bill provides for just terms to be paid for any acquisition that would then take place. That is in clause 51 of the bill. So native titleholders would become able, in appropriate cases, to make that claim for compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not in any way conclude the question as to whether native titleholders do own minerals. It is silent on that issue. Clause 197 of the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this Act, a law of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory may confirm:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) any existing ownership of natural resources by the Crown . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But that is only a right to confirm by legislation existing ownership of resources as that ownership is now enjoyed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem here, quite apart from basic issues of principle, is that the tribunals in this context would have to make a commercial assessment as to whether a percentage of projected profits would amount to greater or lesser compensation than was otherwise available under the other provisions for up-front payments that are provided for under the legislation. It would be a very difficult task for anyone in those circumstances to undertake the task effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make, again from the perspective of justice to Aboriginal people who might feel that their rights are being eroded by this process&mdash;I think wrongly because it is really a pretty large assumption that anything in the nature of mineral rights would ever be recognised as a matter of law&mdash;is that the government's proposed social justice package could provide for royalty equivalent payments to be made by government in certain circumstances, rather than have royalty or profit based payments imposed on mining companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's discussion paper, which was released last June, did canvass those options in detail.

The vast number of Australians are not entitled to this right and Senator Chamarette stood up in this parliament and said, `We want to apply a special series of rights to people who can claim native title'. One of the reasons why there is such widespread concern in the community about this bill and why support for this bill is eroding is that it severely compromises the great Australian value of one law for our people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In justification of this amendment, Senator Chamarette referred to a UN treaty. It seems to me that if we wish to advance the rights of all of our people&mdash;of course we do; we wish to advance all our people, not just special groups, in the appropriate march of democracy through the institutions of this country&mdash;we should do so by passing laws through this parliament, not by allowing Senator Evans to go off to the UN and sign treaties and provide constitutional heads of power. It is bad enough to refer to a treaty which we have already signed&mdash;not passed by this parliament&mdash;but it is now being said that we should adjust our laws to come into conformity with treaties which we have not even signed and which we do not even know the precise wording of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to Senator Chamarette that that sort of thinking is very dangerous thinking. I ask Senator Chamarette and her colleagues to think very carefully before they start referring to UN treaties. If they want to change the rights of people in this country, they should do what democrats do&mdash;I say that in a broad sense, not a party political sense&mdash;and put a law through this parliament and convince our people of it. But do not run off to the UN and try to acquire constitutional heads of power to alter the laws of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans opened up another great area of uncertainty when he spoke. I listened to his remarks very carefully and it seems to me that people will interpret his statement as being an invitation to Aboriginal people to go to the High Court and seek a ruling that they are entitled to the ownership of minerals and the rights which would flow from it. I was rather hoping that Senator Evans would make a clear statement, but he said in a simplistic manner that the High Court is above us all. Of course, it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament has the right to change laws, to make laws which suit our people, provided that they are in conformity with our constitution. We are quite entitled on matters of law, as Senator Evans knows, to override rulings of the High Court, provided that it is within our constitution. So the statement that Senator Evans made is simply not a correct statement. I believe it was an invitation to people to apply to the High Court to obtain these rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which raised very great concern&mdash;again I have to say to Senator Evans that this is why support for this bill is eroding&mdash;is that the government is setting up special rights for particular groups of people. Senator Evans said, `Well, you may not get the rights to mining profits and royalties through the normal processes of the law, but you may be able to get them through a social justice package paid for by all taxpayers'. The rest of us are not entitled to these things but, in answer to Senator Chamarette's question, Senator Evans said that it may be that if those native titleholders do not get it through a High Court decision&mdash;the way he has worded it, a lot of them may well be inclined to do so&mdash;they could perhaps get it through the government's social justice package. Of course, that would be paid for by all taxpayers. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A. A Stake in Industry</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.10 ATSIC has proposed that the Commonwealth legislate to provide for the payment of an amount equal to one third of the royalties raised from particular resource developments on native title land to the native title holders of that land. ATSIC suggests that the payments be made to a corporation which represents the particular native title holders and be utilised for capital infrastructure and/or investment in the resource project or the companies involved in the project. This proposal would not involve additional cost for companies involved in resource development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.11 The concept of providing Aboriginal land holders with access to royalty equivalents is well established and operates in different forms in the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia. It is consistent with long-standing Commonwealth Government policy and legislation in relation to resource development on Aboriginal land as evidenced in the Northern Territory. How these existing schemes relate to any new proposal would have to be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.12 The advantages of the ATSIC proposal include that it:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provides specific native title holders with a significant incentive to support resource development on their particular land;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">has the potential to remove the structural conflict between resource developers and native title holders provided the scheme does not leave open the possibility of extra unexpected claims against the resource developer; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">addresses the perception among indigenous people that they do not benefit significantly from resource development of their land, and can provide for economic benefits to flow to the native title holders beyond the term of the resource development lease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.13 The scheme would need to&mdash;and could&mdash;avoid problems perceived by industry with the statutory scheme under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.14 On the other hand:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the financial cost to governments could be significant over the long term, and arrangements could be complex;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">non-Aboriginal land holders could react negatively to what would be seen as discrimination (as other land holders are not entitled to a royalty equivalent);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there could be serious equity issues created because the scheme would not help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people without native title or who hold native title to land on which there is no resource development; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">while obviously beneficial, a royalty equivalent is an unreliable way of providing a cash flow to finance investments for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as it will fluctuate in line with factors over which the native title holders have no control or influence&mdash;including, for example, world commodity prices and the efficiency of individual companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.15 The questions of when such a scheme might start, and over which projects it would operate will need to be carefully considered. Would it, for example, only cover new projects and, if not, what would be the historical cut-off point? Decisions here would impact significantly on the total costs and benefits of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.16 At the same time there is a strong attraction in breaking down the false psychology which sees resource development and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander interests as being at odds, and in designing mechanisms which provide incentives for development. Accordingly, there is merit in canvassing modifications to the ATSIC proposals including: </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">rather than royalty equivalents, it may be preferable to create a revenue equivalents scheme based on allocation of a proportion of the royalties, taxes, fees, charges and economic rents collected by the community from all resource developments on native title land (i.e. not just mineral developments.) This could be regarded as logically consistent and would in fact broaden the scope for payments to include a share of revenue generated from tourist, fishing, forestry, pastoral interests and the like;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">should governments pursue the concept of a land fund (see paras 9.19 to 9.25 below), it would be possible to allocate some of the revenue equivalent payments to the proposed land fund. Such an arrangement would be broadly comparable with the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account (ABTA) which operates in the Northern Territory; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">among the advantages of such a scheme is that the benefits would flow to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who have maintained their connection with the land and those who have been dispossessed;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">on the other hand, the less the financial benefits to the native title holders, the less the direct stake in development. Also, the approach raises issues of financial equity between States; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">conceivably, the objective could be achieved without the use of revenue equivalents. For example, resource developers could be encouraged&mdash;and possibly facilitated by governments&mdash;to seek native titleholder participation through joint ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.17 A key question in relation to these proposals is cost. The purpose of this discussion paper is to explore concepts&mdash;at this stage no costing of schemes has been done. However, an essential point is that the overall cost would be very much in the hands of governments through decisions about the establishment of a scheme and the rates of revenue equivalents to be paid, etc.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of points made by the opposition and the minister ought to be addressed. The minister has referred constantly to royalties being based on a profit-sharing arrangement. It must be noted that profit sharing is one method only of calculating royalties. There are a number of methods used in various parts of the country. Royalties are a payment for the use of resources. The way royalties are calculated depends sometimes on the mineral or the resource that is being extracted and sometimes on the nature of the industry. It can vary from place to place and from circumstance to circumstance. It is not simply a profit-sharing arrangement because it is payment for the use of resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been constantly mentioned that there is one rule for Aboriginal people and another rule for everybody else; that does not hold true. Governments forgo such resource payments for a variety of reasons and for a variety of deals. This means that the payment for that resource is forgone for some commercial reasons, which are not necessarily in  legislation. It is usually done on a case-by-case basis. Governments, whether state or federal, have the ability to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, only 0.56 per cent of the average rate of royalties on mineral sands is collected in Western Australia compared with the rest of Australia. That is because of the number of deals where that royalty is forgone. The royalty is shared with the company that is mining the sand. There are a number of instances where this occurs. It is not a matter of there being one rule for the people extracting, or one rule for landowners and one rule for everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in Western Australia, royalty sharing or payments for resources are adjusted, almost on a case-by-case basis, often without the knowledge of anybody until somebody finds the secret records. This practice has involved both political parties. Royalties deals arise constantly, depending on the circumstance and depending on what the companies and government think is just, fair or proper at the time. The government says that this does not apply to land-holders, but we are talking about sharing in the benefits of a resource. It is perfectly clear that if it is seen to be appropriate to share in the benefits of that resource with the company extracting it, even forgoing payment of it for an entire year, then it is perfectly appropriate to share the benefits of those resources with people with native title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be helpful if I answer Senator Campbell's questions. The important thing to realise about the amendments to section 36 is that they apply only to the right to negotiate provisions of subdivision (b) of clause 25. In turn, in clause 25 it is made clear that the right to negotiate that we are talking about and the arbitral response that is triggered if that negotiation breaks down, applies only to certain limited situations. Those situations are, firstly, mining related situations and, secondly, compulsory acquisition for a third person. That is made clear in clause 25(2).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 25(2) is the way into this whole subdivision (b) about the right to negotiate and, eventually, when we get to section 36, arbitral determinations. So forestry development has no application in the context of these provisions. If people want to get agreement with native titleholders about a forestry development of the kind that Senator Campbell was contemplating, that is a reasonably straightforward matter. They can normally get a forestry development going only with the agreement of the freeholder owning the land in question. Then they can negotiate their commercial arrangement to their hearts' content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The freehold equivalent principle applies here. A forestry company can negotiate with the native titleholders as though they were freeholders. It would get its commercial deal negotiated and bedded down as a result. None of this would involve the application of this arbitral process one way or the other. I hope that has clarified the situation for Senator Campbell because I know there is a bit of confusion around as to the precise context in which this arbitral stuff works and about profit related payments being determined. It is only in the very limited context that I have described that that would be excluded. </PARA>

The situation of state governments negotiating for a royalty level which would allow the economic development of a mine&mdash;whether it be mineral sands or what have you&mdash;is quite different from the situation of a claim for profit sharing with respect to royalties.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot think of a more succinct way of replying than to say there is no foundation whatsoever for suggesting that the government has changed its mind, is considering changing its mind or may change its mind on the question of the specific vesting of mineral rights in native titleholders. That is no part of our thinking, for reasons that have been amply set out by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only point I made in reply to Senator Chamarette is that the High Court has not passed upon the question as to the extent to which, if at all, mineral rights could be regarded as being associated with native title, or at least some forms of native title. The High Court has not passed upon it. From what it has said, there is no reason whatsoever to think it would conclude that mineral rights are part of native title. The matter simply was not argued before them, so the issue has not been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I was saying is that the legislation does not rule out the possibility of that issue being tested at some time in the future. If it was tested in the future, in my own judgment, as the government's judgment, as to what the state of the law is&mdash;bearing in mind what the High Court said about the nature of native title and knowing what we do about what is necessary to achieve extraction in most forms of minerals these days other than surface outcrops&mdash;the notion of mineral rights below the surface existing as part of native title is a pretty highly implausible one. I do not think anyone should be getting too excited about the possibility of that occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was just simply saying to Senator Chamarette, as I have said on a number of other occasions&mdash;for example, in the context of extinguishment of native title and in the context of valid pastoral leases&mdash;that is an issue which simply has not been finally resolved by the High Court and which is left open by the terms of the legislation, and deliberately so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely the matter is even simpler than Senator Gareth Evans has explained it. This bill is talking about either the restoration of traditional rights to Aboriginals or compensation for them, in the simplest way of describing it. The Aboriginals simply never exercised a mining right. They have never mined silver, gold, lead, zinc or iron. Therefore, there is no traditional right to be re-established. They have not suffered the deprivation of any right or privilege that they exercised. Since they never exercised that privilege, it is therefore quite illogical to depart from the normal course of legal pattern in this country and grant them rights de novo. If they are going to be granted rights de novo, let us go to the North American system and let all landowners have title to what is underneath the soil.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is in hope rather than in expectation, but I will make one final attempt to persuade Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts. To give benefits to people, someone has to raise the necessary money. A piece of paper was being circulated around here today on what the mining veto has cost the government and miners of the Northern Territory. It has cost billions of dollars in wealth not being created; therefore, that wealth has not been able to be passed on to all Australians. If the Greens can tell me how we can meet the needs of people who are on social welfare and other types of benefits by stopping the creation of wealth and jobs, I would very much like to hear their explanation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the Greens want the best of both worlds, and they are being totally impractical. They want to be able to pass benefits on to Aboriginal people, people on social welfare and the underprivileged. But, we have to have a society that can create those benefits before we can pass them back. The government does not have a big bucket of money it can go and dip into to pass out to people. I know it is hard to understand&mdash;and the Greens might not like or even accept it&mdash;but it is a fact of life that, to be able to pass financial benefits on, one has to allow for some wealth creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Greens stop Australia's mining industry&mdash;which employs, I think, about 470,000 people and creates $20 billion in export wealth&mdash;they are harming people who live in remote and regional Australia, including our first Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just happen to have those figures that Senator Boswell was looking for. In relation to this amendment, I do not think the Greens have their hearts in the right place at all. I believe that they are attempting to harvest votes today&mdash;just a few extra votes that may help to hold them in this position after the next election round. That is simply the only cynical reason they have moved this amendment. We had a very similar situation last Saturday that was voted down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it were not for Northern Territory land rights, production of minerals would have been worth $600 million more&mdash;I am not saying $600 million in total&mdash;in 1993 alone. They also cost 4,480 jobs, which is about six per cent of the current work force in the Northern Territory. Further to that, the most likely estimate of this cost by the Centre for International Economics is that an additional $2,390 million of income could have been generated since the introduction of land rights; in other words, $2.390 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the situation is not fixed in the Northern Territory, that cost will rise to $8,000 million in the future, which is $8 billion. To give honourable senators an example of how this fits into the context&mdash;I am sure Senator Jones is interested in this being next door in Queensland&mdash;that $8 billion would be worth four times the annual production of gold in Australia or four wheat crops. Even if the problems with current land rights were rectified, the report indicated that the income forgone would still be a minimum of $2 billion, and that is more than one Australian wool clip a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment shows that the Greens attempt to be nice to the Aborigines just for the sake of getting a few extra votes. Senator Chamarette can shake her head as much as she likes. If she is prepared to move an amendment to give all freehold land-holders in Australia mineral rights, I might support her. That would be a very personal and very biased view towards freehold land-holders. But if they want to move this amendment, they should apply it to everyone, not just a few people. As I have said in this place before, I believe that all Australians should be treated the same before the law in Australia, and anywhere else for that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because I do want to move this amendment, although I know that we do not have the numbers. I want to reply to some of the charges that have been made as to the meaning of this amendment; I believe it needs clarification. The right of veto has not been under discussion; it was simply the capacity to enter into negotiations about profit sharing. It gives the mining companies or the developers an actual bargaining base that could be in their interests as much as in the interests of the native titleholders. It is simply leaving the option open. It is not a discussion of right of veto. That is why Senator Crane's objection is not appropriate. We have not raised that, although we would love to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that when everybody talks about how the mining veto has been such a disaster in the Northern Territory, they fail to mention that in Western Australia owners of all freehold rural land&mdash;be it used for wheat, sheep, wineries, orchards or parkland grazing&mdash;have a veto over mining and mining exploration. This does not seem to have impeded the economic progress of Western Australia. That veto is present; we are not discussing it at the moment and the amendment of the Greens has nothing to do with the mining veto. However, it is relevant in the sense that the actual negotiation powers with the companies under consideration are limited if there is an explicit denial of a capacity to set a determination relating to sharing of royalties. It is also a relevant factor in terms of compensation. That is what the Greens are presenting. There is a cut-down of negotiation rights if, within this bill, there is an explicit exclusion of any capacity to discuss terms of profit sharing that would benefit both parties in the discussion, not simply the native titleholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wanted to correct the impression that we were given by Senator MacGibbon that Aboriginal people have never shown any interest in mining. In fact, the world's oldest mine&mdash;the ochre mine at Wilgi-Mia&mdash;is 20,000 years old and has been managed on an ecologically sustainable basis for 20,000 years. Repeatedly, Aboriginal people have said that they are not opposed to mining development. They do not have a universal position. They do not necessarily come from the same position as the Greens in relation to mining. We believe that they deserve the right of self-determination in those matters. That is why we want the option left open rather than closed. </PARA>

Should a mining company not get a freehold land-holder's permission to go on to that land, they can apply to the wardens court. The wardens court will hear both sides of the argument and will sometimes grant permission to enter. A company can also do the same when it wants to peg a mineral lease.

That is just not within the tribunal's range of arbitral powers under clause 36. Clause 36 deals with only the situations I have described that come out of clause 25(2); that is, the consequences of the right to negotiate being given in two particular situations: first in relation to mining; and, secondly, in relation to compulsory acquisition on behalf of third persons.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the overwhelming majority of cases, particularly those where there is no capacity for a tribunal to determine it, in practice one would reasonably expect that agreement to be reached. Senator Campbell is partially right in saying that a tribunal cannot make a determination on a forestry related matter if it happens to come up through that compulsory acquisition route; I am not disagreeing with that. But to take the further step of saying that a right to negotiate is not there in that situation is not so. Native titleholders would be in the same circumstances as ordinary freeholders, and there is no tribunal anywhere that enables ordinary freeholders to get an arbitration on a profit related solution to a failed negotiation. If we were to give such a solution to native titleholders, that would be doing something different from that which is available to ordinary freeholders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While obviously it is more helpful all round if there is that kind of cooperation through state titles offices, it is not necessary for the purpose of the effective operation of the bill for that to be a part of its central administration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond quickly to this matter and then return to the substance of clauses 25 to 39. It is a complete misconception to think that the Commonwealth or any tribunal established by the Commonwealth needs to have a complete title registry of its own or even have access to it.

Moreover, it is one that I would like to see sought to be immunised from court intervention in the sense that it would not take too smart a lawyer on behalf of a claimant to be able to draft a mandamus or prohibition action of a kind pursuant to these provisions of Commonwealth law if there were any attempt to close that off.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Ian Macdonald gives someone the benefit of his considered wisdom on this matter, he ought to think very hard about the implications of all that, so far as a title exercise and a defensive exercise by land-holders in respect of whom a claim is made is concerned. None of these points make any sense at all. They are just an example of the half-baked, crazy, throwaway lines we have been getting from Western Australia, in particular, and so many people on the other side of this particular argument.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am making some preliminary remarks and then I will be asking the minister some questions. It is only after the state processes have been gone through that a state government can form an intention to acquire. That is what then triggers this notification process, whereby notice has to be given and two months has to elapse to see whether anyone objects. After that, there is a period for mediation; it is four months if it is a prospecting and exploration licence and six months if it is a mining lease or acquisition. That then makes this process blow out to six to eight months. After that, if there is no resolution to that mediation, it then goes for determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is then a period of four months again within which a decision is to be made for prospecting and exploration licences and six months for mining leases and acquisitions. After that, if the act is disapproved, then the minister still has a discretion because an appeal, more or less, can be made to the minister who can then overturn the decision. So there is another hurdle, so to speak. The decision is to be made within two months after the determination. All of that, at the worst case scenario, is a process of some 16 months, and I have not allowed in that for a party which says that it is entitled to be involved in all this and there is a dispute resolution under clauses 60 and 61, if I recall correctly, in relation to parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delay with this process was complained about by the mining industry because in that time the international market could go sour and the venture might then be called off or financiers might say, `Look, this is just too long; it's too strung out' and the project just would not go ahead. Alternatively, a developer which is not BHP or a multinational could just say, `Look, I can't afford all this. It's costing me hundreds of thousands of dollars in lawyers' fees and this process is just too long'. So that then is a distinct disadvantage to development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those preliminary remarks, let me ask the minister in relation specifically to clause 25(2)(b) as to what is called extending the area to which it relates. My question to the minister is this: there may be a situation where there is a mine which has a licence or lease after the tribunal has approved it&mdash;this is after the whole process has been gone through&mdash;which then fails to comply with the terms of the tenement or lease, that is, it does not mine it and it fails for some reason. Miner B may come along and say to the state government, `Look, we will take over that mine because the first lot has failed, and we think it should be forfeited'. In that case would that action be caught by 25(2)(b), the variation of a right or the extension of an area, in any way? Would the second venture have to go through the process again that the first venture went through? Would it have to go back again to the tribunal, back through that process, back to negotiate? If anybody objected, would it give the native titleholder a second bite at the apple?</PARA>

It is not two months on top of that, I am advised. Still, 14 months is a significant time frame&mdash;about as long as this committee stage debate seems like going on present indications, and maybe in that context it is not too bad.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can answer it now. Tell me if I have not answered the whole of your question, but my understanding is that if the variation involves an extension of the area it is true, a person would have to go through another right to negotiate. If it involves a different person on the miner's side, if it involves a variation in the mining interest, the legal personality involved in the mining side, the answer is no, the person would not have to start again or repeat any of these processes, apparently. That can be quite important in the context of joint venture arrangements and so on changing, which is I guess the main reason why one would not want to have a further protraction of these proceedings following on variations of that kind.

<PARA>I intervene with this matter because the debate that flows from what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said is totally relevant. We just witnessed an ignorant Prime Minister attacking not only the coalition but also the processes of the Senate itself. This Prime Minister fails to understand the functioning of a house of review. In fact, we know from his previous statements that if he had his way we would be abolished but, if he could not get away with an abolition, then we would simply be treated as a rubber stamp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just heard from the Prime Minister that a filibuster has been occurring in this place for almost a full day. Yet he is obviously not communicating with his minister here. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) acknowledged this morning that there has not been a filibuster; that there has been a proper conduct of a difficult and complex debate which is raising serious social issues and legal issues in the way in which this Senate is structured to conduct such debates. When the chamber has before it over 200 amendments in a debate as complex as this, they do take time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could abandon our responsibilities as a house of review and do what the Prime Minister wants and simply rubber-stamp this bill through, but we are not prepared to do so. Perhaps that is a good thing because the Prime Minister&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans ought to hear this&mdash;says that he is prepared to debate this bill as long as is necessary. He said that the Senate will get up on Christmas Eve and come back on Boxing Day. Well, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we understand that Senator Gareth Evans is in the process of negotiating a guillotine with the Greens and the Australian Democrats. That would not surprise us because, whenever we have had a serious debate that has taken some time in this place, in the end the Greens and the Democrats&mdash;no matter what they have said in the past&mdash;have said, `We'll agree to cut short the debate. We want to go home. We'll guillotine it. We are not interested in the very serious issues'. And so they have brought the debate to a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting to hear the Prime Minister's attitude towards the state Premiers. He regarded the views of the Premiers, as they were put this afternoon&mdash;that this bill should be withdrawn and that it should be taken to the next COAG meeting for serious debate between the states and the Commonwealth&mdash;as irrelevant to the total process. The Prime Minister has bagged the state Premiers; he has bagged AMIC; and he is now bagging the NFF. He bags anyone or any group that does not hold his particular view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that gets to the core of this whole problem. What the Prime Minister is doing at the moment is encouraging division in this country. He is encouraging confrontation and, albeit whether deliberately or not, the Greens and the Democrats are unfortunately part of that process. What we have put on this side of the chamber is that this is such a complex, difficult issue&mdash;an issue that can cause such social dislocation in the community&mdash;that the Prime Minister ought to be going out of his way to draw together interested parties; that is, the states, the Commonwealth, industry and the Aboriginal community. He should draw them all together, take time and use whatever proper processes are necessary&mdash;whether that be through a royal commission, a Senate select committee or whatever&mdash;to seek to build a cooperative attitude to the matter and to try to build a consensus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that, of course, is not the attitude of the Prime Minister. He has said, `I've looked at this matter. In fact, I've been dealing with it for a year. It requires no more consensus than what my view is'. As a matter of interest, the Prime Minister also said that the bill is totally clear and that there are no issues requiring further clarification because he has been looking at it for a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that when the Prime Minister was asked some specific questions at the end of the press conference in relation to the bill he could not answer any of them. He became embarrassed, attacked the coalition again, attacked the Senate again and then walked out of the press conference. He could not answer a simple question on the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to speak for very long on this occasion, but I do want to pick up a couple of points that have been made in the debate up until now on this group of clauses and make reference to some points that were made in the suspension motion. The first point I want to raise with respect to the debate on the suspension motion is that concerning honourable senators on the other side saying that we should not engage in any delays and that a debate on the clauses which we are now in the middle of is a delay and a filibuster. That is the aspect that I want to raise because the integrity of people who want to raise detailed points, as I and other senators have, has been questioned by the remarks of, for example, Senator Collins, Senator Bolkus, et al. I take the opportunity whenever that accusation is made to reinforce the point. This group of clauses is of no lesser value than any other group of clauses in the bill.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But instead of a sense of historical moment, debate on the bill in the Senate has elicited mean-spirited opportunism and truculent inflexibility.</PARA>

We all know that people on this side of the chamber have a different view as to how to respond to Mabo No. 2. Everyone understands that. I do not think there is any animosity or aggro about it. We just have a different view.

Coming from the honourable senator whose first contribution was to come in here today and simply lambaste people on this side, it is not really worth pursuing his point. I will stick to the point I was making: it does not matter what one's view is as to whether this is the appropriate response to Mabo No. 2 or not. This bill, I presume, will be passed. These people here have decided it will be passed and, in that sense, our job is not done until we have it in the best form possible. That happens not just by moving amendments&mdash;some people think the only way to achieve improvements in this place is to move an amendment here or there&mdash;but sometimes by drawing attention to problems that all parties might want to fix.

If there is an agreement situation and the claimant offers to forgo native title, how can a claimant do that without a determination being made?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that is a fair question in the sense that if one is entering into an agreement one would want that to be enforceable and one would want the conferring of title flowing from it to be utilised in the way that has been suggested. To achieve the necessary degree of certainty one would wish to wait until the determination has been made and the body corporate has been established to be the vehicle through which some of these things are done. As a practical matter, I guess that is right. Technically, native title rights do exist and are able to be exercised before they are actually deemed to exist by the tribunal. The tribunal process is a matter of recognition rather than the creation of the right in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that if there were a high degree of confidence of all concerned that this was unequivocally a case of legitimate native title rights being held, if one wanted to get on with the business of doing something as a matter of urgency and one were prepared to enter into an agreement with the people concerned, and if there were a formalising of that agreement to everybody's satisfactory, there is no inhibition posed by this legislation on such an agreement proceeding with the claimant. I think that addresses the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of agreement, I am advised that there would be no technical inhibition either in proceeding by way of compulsory acquisition against a complainant. It is a rather odd situation and I suppose no state would want to find itself in the position of shelling out funds on a compulsory acquisition basis in relation to a claim that is not yet determined unless everyone had a very high degree of confidence that it was simply a matter of formalising the obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot really add much to that.

There are fast track ways of achieving the same result. </PARA>

The whole point of requiring applicants to register is in order to establish some kind of priority in terms of whom one deals with. To the extent that one can deal with an applicant, and has dealt with an applicant, and reach an agreement with a particular applicant whose claim is registered, then that would continue to stick, as I understand the legislation, notwithstanding some subsequent applicant coming in and a subsequent course of events leading to some revision as to which claimant has the finally determined native title status. But because of the need to get some degree of certainty, from the point of view of other interests with whom native titleholders are dealing, that is why some status is vested in those who make a formal application and who get their claim registered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. That interjection was not in good taste, Senator Crane. If one is negotiating, that is, for an agreement, or if one is going through a compulsory acquisition process and dealing with claims that have been determined, there is no problem under the legislation because even if a subsequent claimant comes along, that determination can be varied only on the basis of very good evidence&mdash;and that provision is set out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It still is the case that it is not impossible for a government&mdash;or whoever&mdash;to negotiate with such a claimant, but in the context of a compulsory acquisition normally the notice would be given, the acquisition would be made and the question of who would be entitled to subsequent compensation would need to be resolved&mdash;and probably would depend upon a determination being reached. Equally, if one is contemplating an agreement being reached, it is probably the case that one would not sensibly pay out money pursuant to that agreement unless one was satisfied that the person had a higher status than that of merely a registered claimant. It is possible to anticipate a condition being set under those circumstances that the claimant have the determination resolved in his favour before the payment is made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is true. But when one is dealing with a particular claimant who has not yet been the subject of a determination, the process for getting a determination does not take endlessly long. It takes some time, as we discussed earlier, but one could proceed to get the determination and just have an indemnity arrangement, perhaps, that was conditional upon the determination being resolved favourably for that claimant.

<PARA>The Greens' amendment to clause 31A stems from the failure of our amendment to clause 36(2). There is one change in wording to the amendment as circulated. The word `must' in the first line is replaced by the word `may'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment represents a statement of intent. It is a fairly weak statement but it prevents clause 36(2) which gives the impression that this parliament is agreeing to legislation which limits any negotiation aspects relating to mining and other developments so that there is no possibility of negotiating profit sharing. This simply puts it back in the negotiating section rather than the arbitral bodies determination process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there was some misunderstanding in the discussion that occurred when we were debating clause 36(2). This clearly puts it in the perspective which we have in mind. The concern of the Greens is still very much there: the fact that there is nothing within clause 36(2) that requires negotiation to occur; that a time limit may simply expire without all the relevant aspects being covered. This particular amendment, 31A, allows for discussion and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, this amendment provides for fairness. It responds to the fact that in the United States and Canada mining companies are well used to such negotiating arrangements with indigenous people. This amendment gives companies the liberty to do the same here. It facilitates negotiations and agreements being made. This reframing of the amendment virtually rules out any of the concerns about veto or right of consent. It simply offsets the negative implications of clause 36(2), under which negotiation cannot occur. It says `may' rather than `must', so I urge the chamber to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Throughout the debate on the previous Green amendment I said that there was a capacity to negotiate profit based or royalty equivalent arrangements, and that nothing in the bill inhibited that possibility. Therefore, it would be a little churlish for the government not to accede to this amendment, and we do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were troubled by the language in which it was originally circulated, because the reference to negotiations having to&mdash;in the sense of compulsion&mdash;address such issues. That opened up the spectre of mandamus, prohibition, and so on, simply to get something onto the negotiating table without any requirement that it be the subject of actual agreement between the parties, let alone a subsequent arbitral process. That seemed to us to open up a quite unnecessary further legal minefield. With the language now modified to make it clear that this kind of agreement is not excluded if it can be reached between the parties, we have no objection to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we said earlier, the fact that there is a quite different underlying legal regime in Australia as compared with North America&mdash;the US and Canada&mdash;and as a result it is not easy to simply translate to an Australian context some of the legal regimes that are in the practices that are in place there, in particular, the non-recognition in Australia of mineral rights and so on, creates a quite different legal background against which these issues are properly looked at. All that said, nonetheless, the notion of royalty equivalent is rather well established in various bits of legislation, including state legislation, around the place. It is not a foreign concept that there should be a proper based agreement in appropriate cases. Just to acknowledge the existence of a capacity to negotiate and reach agreements about that is something that does not add any degree of difficulty to the bill and we support it accordingly. </PARA>

It is simply creating a right to negotiate&mdash;nothing further than that. I believe it is in the interests of fairness. It is not any superior rights and it has nothing to do, unfortunately, with the relationship of native title to the minerals under the ground.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question really relates to the whole theme behind the bill, but I think it is relevant to this area. Would the minister agree that, under the bill, native title rights are equated to freehold rights? The minister said earlier that, when compulsorily acquiring land, everything had to be done in the same way as for freehold.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a matter of actually equating them to freehold rights, it is just that, in various parts of the bill, the freehold test is applied as a benchmark measure of whether governments or others can do things in relation to native titleholders. In a variety of those contexts&mdash;remember one of them was riparian right situations and native titleholders having some rights to the use of rivers&mdash;there was a reference to what rights in relation to the river the owner of an adjacent freehold title would be able to possess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about various kinds of government action being taken&mdash;whether by way of granting certain interests over land or whether or not certain acquisition strategies could be pursued&mdash;the test in these cases is, `What could government do with equivalent land that was held by a freehold holder?'. That is not to say, by any means, that all native title rights are going to be regarded as freehold equivalent with all the exclusive possession and considerations that go with that. A number of native title rights may be held to be much less substantial than that. They might simply involve access rights, hunting, gathering, foraging and so on. In that situation there will be something conspicuously short of freehold rights being exercised, but nonetheless in order to ensure that those interests, which are very important to the people in question, are properly protected, the limitation of the freehold equivalent test is built in at various key parts of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I am advised that one of the reasons for this is simply to provide certainty for land management regimes and the people who apply them, as to what can and cannot be done. If what one could do varied in accordance with the particular content of the native title right in question&mdash;which might be very substantially variable, depending on the determination made by the tribunal in each case&mdash;there would be a constant element of uncertainty as to the circumstances under which we could grant leases, licenses, permits and so on. But if we have a rule of thumb test of this kind, it introduces that degree of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The quantum of the compensation and so on that will flow in particular cases for some impairment of the rights in question will depend on a rather close analysis of what the nature of those rights are and the extent to which they are being impaired. In that context, there will be quite a big difference between rights that are in the nature of freehold rights which are interfered with and rights which are of a much lesser status. If we were just talking about hunting or foraging rights, or something of this kind, when it comes to the compensation question there will be no effective interference, in practice, with those rights and therefore no compensation at all would be payable. That is a perfectly conceivable situation. I hope I have made that clear. It is a test in order to give certainty to land managers. It is not a description of what the weight, the content or the compensability of a particular native title interest may be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As with all residual discretionary provisions found in statutes, they are never as wide-ranging as they appear at first sight because they are subject to administrative law principles and, in particular, the criterion of relevance. Any Commonwealth minister who insisted upon some utterly, manifestly irrelevant criterion or requirement having to be satisfied would expose himself to action under administrative law to bring him or her back to the field. It is a precautionary residual discretion designed, as draftsmen usually write these things, to ensure that anything manifestly relevant that they forget is picked up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This area is a particularly sensitive area for the states, naturally, because it deals with the recognition of their arbitral body. The point I make is that, whilst it is a very sensitive area, it should be carefully catered for. I take the minister's point on administrative law; he is, of course, correct. But the problem we have is that it is easier to argue that the minister concerned failed to take into account relevant criteria than to argue that he considered something which was irrelevant, because we can never really know what the minister addressed himself to, although it might be apparent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see this as a problem in the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. For instance, if the tribunal were to make decisions which the Commonwealth did not like, the Commonwealth minister could then revoke recognition. The point I am making is: could that be a relevant criterion? It makes it very difficult for the states to address the failure to recognise situations in an administrative fashion. It is very difficult to get cases up under administrative law when they are brought on the basis that an irrelevant consideration was taken into account. The minister could say, `These things were considered and this is the answer', but, without being too cynical, there could well be other things playing on a minister's mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the truth of the matter is that, in practice, there will be cooperative discussion behind the establishment of any of these tribunals. My understanding is there have already been cooperative discussions of that kind with Queensland and New South Wales. This is simply a way of ensuring that the product of that cooperative discussion, even if it is not precisely confined to criteria (1) to (8), can be taken into account in the establishment of the body. I know it refers only to the opinion or the consideration of the Commonwealth minister, but as a practical matter, we are talking about bodies being established through a consultative, cooperative process.

Ultimately, it has to be the subject of determination. If that subsequent claimant comes along later, the process can presumably, in relation to negotiations, be stretched out to that extent. It will become more apparent when we get to debate&mdash;if we ever do&mdash;clauses 56 and 57 that, as I have intimated previously, there will be tough provisions governing frivolous and vexatious claims and, more than that, claims which cannot withstand prima facie credibility scrutiny against that sort of test.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing more that I can say. These things have to speak for themselves. I remind Senator Kemp again&mdash;and it is in the amendment that has been circulated and that will come up for discussion&mdash;that it is not only the concept of `frivolous and vexatious' that is ground for declining registration; it is also the concept of not being able to make out a prima facie case. I think that is a more useful test in some ways than the frivolous and vexatious claim, because it goes directly to the substance and quality of the claim, the supporting documentation and so on. For that reason we are not proposing that the registrar apply that test. It is a matter which involves judgment about sufficiency of evidence and so on and, as such, is better made by a presiding member. But I think this is an important further guarantee, as it were, in the way in which the bill will operate and it is one that ought to be applauded by those who are concerned to get maximum certainty as fast as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do think Senator Kemp was overstating somewhat the adverse implications for fundraising, investment, finance and so on of having a native title claim. He can say these things, but he should look at the way in which the rest of the bill is constructed&mdash;certainly, the absence of a veto right over mining developments and the capacity for the tribunal to make a determination which, in turn, is subject to override by the relevant government. All of those things should give very considerable comfort to developers and those who finance them that these native title claims should not be regarded as operating to fundamentally inhibit any major economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded that at any stage of an inquiry relating to an application&mdash;not just at the time of registration&mdash;the tribunal may dismiss an application if it is satisfied that it is frivolous or vexatious. So even if it gets past a threshold test, when the inquiry gets started and it becomes apparent that the promised evidentiary material is simply not forthcoming or whatever, there is an opportunity again to draw down the curtain. That is covered under clause 140. Similarly, not being able to make out a prima facie case is also applicable at later stages in the proceeding rather than just at the threshold. In all those circumstances, I honestly think that we have gone as far as we can to satisfy that kind of concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not get any reassurance from what the minister has said on that matter and, obviously, he cannot give any more. If a number of claimants are looking at claiming for the same native title, even if they have to put in an affidavit, the minister has not described to the committee any active disincentive for someone to lodge what, on the face of it, would look like a very valid and sensible claim, even if that person or group of people did not have that claim.

But in this case, I cannot remember the minister saying that there is any penalty if people put their name to a claim and say that they have had a long association with the land, and if they put down all of the criteria that fulfilled that application&mdash;knowing full well that they were not the facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reassured. I had wanted to raise a matter on clause 26 before Senator Vanstone sped us forward to clause 27. My question related to clause 236(2)(g), the recognised state and territory bodies. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) knows, the Commonwealth minister has to be consulted on appointments to the arbitral body. There is obvious concern about why the federal minister would need to be consulted on those appointments. Furthermore, with the power to de-recognise an arbitral body, the minister effectively has the power of veto on every single appointment to it. To me, that is a gross infringement of a state government's right to appoint people to a body that is making important decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply cannot see why that provision is in there if, as the minister says, the states are being encouraged to use their arbitral bodies. Supposedly, decisions should be devolved as much as possible, yet this creates a system whereby the federal minister has an effective veto over the appointments to that body. If the government is genuinely about staying out of matters as long as the states do the right thing, why is there an effective veto over every appointment to the arbitral body?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think `effective veto' is putting it much too highly. The language of the paragraph should be read in its own terms. It is a requirement for consultation, not for approval, and any attempt to exercise other powers over the whole tribunal simply because of dissatisfaction would pretty obviously run into not only political difficulties but legal difficulties as well in terms of criteria and relevance, except in perhaps some very exceptional case. Might I also remind Senator Campbell that there is provision for cross-appointments from state to Commonwealth tribunals, and that the Commonwealth has undertaken to happily consult in that particular context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to make is the one I sought to make earlier to Senator Vanstone, that the creation of these state arbitral bodies and tribunals is premised on the assumption of cooperation and the establishment of a working relationship. I am told that there have been signs of that developing amicably in the initial discussions about these bodies that have taken place with two states, Queensland and New South Wales, and one would hope and expect that that spirit would carry through. Obviously it is desirable to get people with appropriate qualifications and appropriate sensitivity. It is appropriate that views about just those considerations be swapped, but it is not intended that any veto be applied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were unable to persuade others who were likely to contribute to a majority on this matter that the change was worth making&mdash;that is the short answer for that. We would not have had the numerical support for it. I think the amendment was not a terribly substantial matter concerning clause 25(4). The original clause in the legislation reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the Commonwealth Minister considers the act will have minimal effect on any native title concerned . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment was to substitute `land' for the words `native title' so that it read `minimal effect on any land concerned'. I suppose that the use of the word `land' is a more objective test. It does not necessarily presume the existence of native title, which might not be clear until the determination process has been gone through. That is why we thought there might be some virtue in having a lesser test just to look at the land, rather than at the native title which implies the particular kind of usage of that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We discovered that the support was not there for that amendment and so there was no particular point in moving it. The concept is essentially the same. One has to look at the impact on the land itself in order to look in turn at what the impact on the native title for that patch of land would be. We have to be looking at the same sort of thing. It might have made it a bit easier to satisfy in practice if we limited it to looking at the impact on the land rather than the title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in the day it seemed to me that the minister was confused between what were public works and private works. The whole aspect of a state agreement is that it is based basically on private works. I would not go so far as to say that is exclusive, but certainly there would be no state agreement unless it were substantially based on private works. If a state agreement is put together after certain potential has been discovered, will it be subject to tribunal veto?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is possible for that sequence of events to unfold in that way. One of the things that native title involves is a capacity to negotiate and ultimately seek arbitration if negotiations fail on these matters. It is within the competence of the arbitral tribunal to determine that the mine, in this case, not go ahead. But the intention underlying the whole legislative structure is to try to create an environment in which significant national interest or significant economic developments are not inhibited but, rather, can proceed on the basis of appropriate conditions, appropriate compensation and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the minister was not suggesting that I am not objective. There was certainly that insinuation, but I will not take offence at this time. The minister has just told us, in effect, that no major mining company will even bother to look further into the Western Australian situation, in particular, where there have been many large discoveries of a variety of minerals, because the only way that they can develop and become fruitful is if there is certainty. I did not raise this point because I knew it was well canvassed today and I understand that quite clearly.

That will be to the disadvantage of all Australians but, in particular, to the disadvantage of those people who live locally in those areas.

We have so many yeses and noes all tangled up that it will drive mining away. It has been brought to my attention that a number of chief executives of a number of mining companies have said that they will go offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next question is in relation to state agreements. I remind the minister that places such as Paraburdoo, Tom Price and Goldsworthy are mining towns. They were constructed and put there by the mining companies. A number of those towns have now been transferred to public control and there is a system in place whereby individuals are buying the houses. So there is a transfer, I guess, to a more traditional system. Will the tribunal have the right to vary a proposed agreement which has been reached between the state and the mining company in the sense that it might say, `You can do X amount of mining, but you cannot build a mining town there.'? Will it have that power? In other words, can it vary the agreement?</PARA>

What will happen? Brazil, Argentina or some other nation will have a number of Australian mining companies over there just as quickly as they can get there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask a few specific questions of Senator Evans. I remind him that I have not really participated in this debate, although I suppose I should have. The situation I outline is real, not hypothetical. Most of the Queensland coalmining leases were taken over areas that held either grazing leases or were freehold. The companies at the time, instead of buying the properties, paid compensation to the landowners to surrender the properties to the Crown; which meant that even under the Mabo decision, grazing and freehold leases had extinguished native title. We now have a situation where that land has become crown land. The mining companies were issued leases and surface rights&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly our understanding of the High Court decision on this that extinguishment means extinguishment, and not a capacity to revive. That is why we had to make explicit statutory provision for the revival of native title in the context of future grants of mining interests. We worked on the assumption that any grant of a mining interest, just as with the freehold or pastoral lease before it, would accomplish the extinguishment as a matter of common law. So if one wants to keep it from being non-extinguished, one has to say so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where there was crown land&mdash;and in some cases there has been crown land where this has occurred&mdash;the state government itself, going back into the 1970s, gave various leases of 10 years plus 10 years, or 20 years plus 20 years. It did this for its own requirements. It thought that at the end of the period it may well be able to extract a better deal from the companies that were there or even go out and make another one. Presumably at the end of the 20 years, which was there for a specific state requirement, this then enables native title to be claimed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise another point so that the minister can answer two questions in one. As the minister knows, a lot of those leases were for specific purposes. For example, we could mine for coal but we could not extract gas. So when a lease on crown land was offered for 10 years plus 10 years, at the end of that 10-year period, or even in the interim period, a decision was made to give someone either an exploration licence or an authority prospect, whatever it is called in the various states, to extract gas. How would that be affected under this particular legislation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, whatever the purpose of the lease and whatever the duration of the lease, it is our judgment that once these kinds of leases are granted, as a matter of common law, native title is extinguished. That has been the situation in the past. It will not be the situation in the future. In the future, once the lease is granted, it will suppress the native title operation only for as long as the lease continues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When such a lease was granted in the past&mdash;whether it had been for partial extraction of just one kind of mineral and that had been supplemented by an overlay lease of some kind at a later stage for, say, gas, when it was previously for coal&mdash;it would not make any difference. The threshold rule to remember is that extinction means extinction. It is gone; it is dead. It cannot come back; it cannot revive. Everything else follows from that. There is a small element of doubt&mdash;which I have mentioned a number of times in responding to the Greens, concerns about this&mdash;because it has not been decided by the High Court once and for all that that is so. But the overwhelming probability is that it will prove to be so as far as past valid grants are concerned. I think everything follows from that basic premise. </PARA>

Maybe this is saying no more than what Senator Vanstone was saying, but in a situation where decision is made, money is paid to the trustee to hold the money in trust until such time as the question of the determination of title is resolved and then the government says it is not going to go ahead with the act in question, under those circumstances the trustee would pay the money back to the government and no longer hold it because there is no longer any anticipated impairment of the native title when determined. Under those circumstances, it would be ruled out from the government then jumping back in and doing the act in question anyway. If people go through this cycle of making the determination, putting the money into trust, deciding against it and paying the money back via the trustee, they cannot avoid going through all those hurdles all over again before they do the act in question.</PARA></TALK.START>

Even though the state is talking about the same proposal completely, the Commonwealth government has provided no mechanism for the money to somehow be put back in trust or to bypass going through that procedure again.

I recall a provision where, when dealing with a mine, for example, if the mine area and the mine proposal remain the same but the personnel of the mine applicants change&mdash;because there is a change in joint venture arrangements or a change in the nature of the partnership involved&mdash;it is possible for the process to proceed without starting again.</PARA></TALK.START>

All of those are massive resource developments which have had a long foundation period, in some cases taking up to 10 to 15 years to get them through.

Clearly, to have to go through the whole process again two or three years down the track would be an even greater disincentive to economic development.

That is provided for in clause 56(1)(c). That will remain more or less the same when this clause is amended. I cannot recall whether the numbering will be the same. Clause 56(1)(c) states that the application has to `state the name and address of the person who is to be taken to be the claimant'. Realistically, one has to be able to operate through some individual or some corporate entity as the vehicle for signing up to negotiations at the end of the day once one has a determined status.

But is the minister's answer still the same&mdash;that a traditional nomadic family group that may not be super-sweet with ATSIC, or be remotely interested in it, and does not hear about this until after two months is just dead meat and locked out? The government has no provision to handle such a group. If ever the minister practised and did not get something in on time, there would have been a facility for him to get his out of time matter up.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some questions on clause 31, or at least they are consequential on 31, because they relate to the definition on page 104. I refer to the act attracting the expedited procedure; it is a very narrow procedure. Where the notice states that the expedited procedure should apply and the native title parties do not object within two months, the act may be done without the right to negotiate procedure. Given the definition in clause 222 on page 104 of all the things that the act cannot do in order to be an act attracting the expedited procedure, can the minister give me a couple of examples of what he imagines we would be able to do under the expedited procedure arrangements?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assumption is that most forms of exploration licence would probably come within this sort of category, or at least attract the potential for this sort of provision to apply. We are talking about something a little bit more than what was previously described as `low impact activity': camping, beekeeping, car rallies&mdash;some essentially transient activity of that kind, which should not properly attract these provisions at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are cases of an intermediate class which clearly do not, by their nature, involve major impairment. They may involve a quite short-term presence; for example, seismic or general exploration activity&mdash;rock chopping that geologists do or outcrop surveying or something of that kind. Provided that activity does not interfere with sites of particular significance or with community life and provided that it does not create a major disturbance, it is possible for that to go ahead and attract the expedited procedure, for which provision is made in clause 31. There is still provision for objection and so on to it, but not the whole box and dice of processes that apply when a major substantive impact is involved. </PARA>

We told the Australian Democrats that we did not like it before, they know we do not like it and they said that they were not going to pursue it with great vigour. The bill deals with the effect on native title of past invalid grants and future grants, as we know. To make provision in the bill now for the effect of past valid grants would be to venture into rather more controversial territory. This amendment, for example, deals only with the effect of past valid mining grants for which it provides non-extinguishment.</PARA></TALK.START>

I imagine they would not. Therefore, it is better to leave the effective past valid grants to the common law. That is a fine spirited response. See what happens when I stick to the script? An amendment of this sort would create significant uncertainty, at least in the minds of those in the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point about trespassing onto territory and of the impact of valid grants is that to do it systematically and comprehensively would involve some major redrafting of a number of different areas of the bill. We are content to rest with the notion, so far as the extinguishment issue is concerned, that it is a matter for the courts to determine. We believe that the law is pretty clear on this. The High Court intimated in the leading judgment of Justice Brennan, and in the other relevant judgments that touched upon this, that the principle of extinguishment would apply. But there is some reason for doubt and it is appropriate that it should be the subject of litigation to test that matter once and for all. We have said that on many occasions. </PARA>

The minister is not required to formally give reasons, as such, for his decision. But he is subject, as all these sorts of decisions are, to normal administrative law process.

I said that I am proceeding on the assumption that normal administrative law principles would apply in this situation. I said as much about one minute ago in answer to the last question. It is not terribly usual for provisions empowering ministers or anyone else in the executive to give reasons. There are as many examples of that kind of clause as not.

In examining the question of whether or not to overrule, is there criteria that the minister must apply? Does he have to go back to the criteria that the tribunal adopted? How does he know?

There is no provision for such a decision to be taken on the approach by one or other of the parties. In a sense, it is anticipated here that the kind of decision that would be made and the kind of criteria that would be applied would not be of the kind going to the interests of the individual parties but rather to overriding national interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the negotiations over the McArthur River mine project earlier this year, the government's native title proposals were still being developed. The Northern Territory government and the McArthur River mine, the MRM, put to the Commonwealth that early action was needed to ensure the validity of the McArthur River mine leases. They told us this could not await the development of a national solution to native title because the company was approaching a critical decision on funding and that, for this purpose, international investors had to be certain of the validity of these land titles. We agreed to a legislative scheme under which the leases would be validated by legislation passed by the Northern Territory assembly. However, we put it to the Northern Territory government that, in keeping with developing national policy, the leases should not extinguish native title. In a letter dated 25 May 1993 to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While my government will support legislation to validate the McArthur River leases, we will not support the unnecessary extinguishment of native title. Should you legislate as you indicate, we reserve the option of remedial action with reference to a wider Mabo context.</PARA>
<PARA>In the event, the Northern Territory legislation made no provision for the effect of the validation on any remaining native title and, in effect, left this to the common law. To provide certainty, and in keeping with the reservation that was made in the Prime Minister's letter of 25 May, clause 44 of this bill brings the McArthur River leases in line with all other mining leases which are to be validated by means of this bill. In other words, the non-extinguishment principle applies. This means that the holders of any remaining native title in respect of the mining leases validated by the Northern Territory legislation will not be at a disadvantage in comparison with native titleholders affected by the validation provisions of the bill before the Senate. </PARA>

As the means sought to be achieved by this measure have already been covered by other provisions of the bill, clause 44 would in effect be totally unnecessary. I believe that the evidence given by the general manager of Mount Isa Mines for the McArthur River project, Mr Peter Freund, at the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in Darwin last month very specifically addressed that matter and drew it to the attention of the committee and thereby the government.

We were prepared to act to help out the project and make sure that it could go ahead in the circumstances in which we found it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This clause is all about the situation where people who would otherwise be native titleholders of the land in question but for the probable extinguishment of that title as a result of common law principles applying to the lease can nonetheless get that native title back if they are the owners of the pastoral lease now in question and if they have that status as satisfying the criteria that they need to satisfy to be determined to be a native titleholder.

That is the one that involves the de facto revival of native title, the native title equivalent, notwithstanding its probable formal extinguishment in situations where a pastoral lease is acquired or is owned by a particular Aboriginal group which would otherwise have the native title. That is what it means. Those opposite might have some policy objection to it, but I do not think there is too much argument about what it means.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Just because a person is sitting on a pastoral lease, if he has no common law connection with the land in question that he is sitting on, he cannot convert that to native title. It is only if he would otherwise be able to establish a native title claim. Clause 45(1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section applies if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) when the application is made, a pastoral lease is held over the area by:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) any of the persons who made the application claiming to hold the native title or any other persons with whom they claim to hold the title; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)a trustee, on trust for any of those persons; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)a company . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is not just enough to claim the thing to enjoy the status, then, of taking over. The applicant has to be established by the tribunal to have the appropriate status and has to be determined to be, in effect, a native titleholder. I keep saying `in effect' because this is premised on the assumption that the actual native title has been extinguished as a result of the conferral of the pastoral lease. </PARA>

In terms of the establishment of native title, if it concerns an Aboriginal holder who satisfies the requirements of Mabo No. 2 to establish native title then that is clear. What I am trying to establish is the statute provision of establishing native title, which I do not believe one can divorce from the complexities of it. If the minister wants to tell me that I need to ask this question in releation to some other part of the bill then that is fine and I will do it there.

The particular scenario he is painting is that native title equivalent holders who own pastoral leases may choose to sell their leases, for whatever reason, and Senator Minchin wants to know what the status of the native title claim would be thereafter. It would be an unlikely circumstance in which it would be sold; I think we have to make that the working assumption. It is not that there is a legal inhibition on them doing so.

We have established that if native title can be proved by Aboriginals who own a station then native title exists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not what I said before. If people want to convert a pastoral lease in which the presumption of extinguishment applies to a native title equivalent, the pastoral lease must be vested in them. If it is a matter simply of occupying a statutory reservation area and someone else's pastoral lease, where it is possible, as I said before, that some residue of native title applies because it can co-exist with that statutory or common law reservation, I guess the native title claimants could seek a determination as to whether they do have native title over the area of the reservation.

I do not believe the minister has thought through the ramifications of where reservations are being held. I am certainly not opposed to those reservations. In fact, I support them.

It is unworkable to provide justice and equity in Western Australia, the Northern Territory and South Australia. It needs to go back to the drawing board and be put in a form where it meets those objectives. Otherwise&mdash;and I have already had this said to me by a number of elders in Western Australia&mdash;it is going to cause massive and dangerous conflict in a number of communities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very big unresolved question as to what kind of native title, if any, would be regarded as surviving in those circumstances. It is the case that, quite apart from the small geographical proportion of a pastoral property on which there might be some statutory reservation or common law right based on occupancy established, some Aboriginal reservations do extend to traversing, hunting and activity of that kind on the lease as a whole. It is conceivable, although this certainly remains to be resolved by the High Court, that to the extent that the complete economic enjoyment of the lease could still proceed consistently with that limited right being enjoyed by the native titleholders, there might be a native title right defined in those terms&mdash;the right to hunt, gather, camp or something of that kind. That is possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the courts were to uphold that possibility, that would still be a rather limited kind of right. Any other character to the right would have been extinguished by the grant of the original lease. If the lease were to be surrendered to the Crown, the only kind of native title right that would be left in these circumstances is the very limited version that we are talking about that would not have greater character than that. Certainly there would be complete subjection to the ordinary laws of the state in that respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One would hope so, but that would really be to pursue a false dream. The amendment makes clear that where there exists public utilities, such as water supplies, on pastoral leases where native title is recognised under this clause, they will remain the property of the relevant government. It is a bit hard to see how that impacts adversely on the interests of native titleholders or anybody else. Be that as it may, I note the Greens' position and ask them to reconsider. I hope they will, but I have no great confidence that, in the circumstances, that is likely. So maybe that is another issue that will have to be subject to review at some later stage next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far amendment 16 is concerned, the Greens possibly have underestimated the extent to which the real impact of what they are trying to say in that amendment is covered by our amendment 20. Government amendment 20 to clause 45 does make it clear, in determining whether native title exists over land, that any extinguishment caused by acts done under the lease are to be disregarded. Acts done under the lease could include the fencing off of areas thus preventing future access to the land by the native titleholders&mdash;in other words, the sort of situation that I think Senator Chamarette has in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble with Senator Chamarette's amendment, which also addresses the situation of exclusion from a pastoral lease, is that we read it as just simply going too far, in effect providing for conversion to native title in these pastoral lease situations, even though the Aboriginal people in question have not had a continuous connection with the land. It is an understandable attempt to deal with situations where at some stage or another people were forced off the land, but we see that a continuing connection of some kind, not necessarily physical, with the area in question in accordance with their customs and laws still needing to be established. We think it goes too far to strip away all of those criteria. There are clear criteria in the common law and we believe they should have some force and effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, I have to say that we have difficulty with amendment 17, which addresses the question of escape from obligation arising under the ordinary terms of the pastoral lease. We see the effect of this provision&mdash;whether it is intended I do not know&mdash;as enabling those of acquired native title to surrender the native title by converting a pastoral lease and thereby escaping from any obligations arising from the pastoral lease. It is certainly not our intention that by converting a pastoral lease into native title the owners would be able to renounce the pastoral lease and then escape from the obligations which the pastoral lease carries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pastoral industry is obviously a very important export earner. We are committed to its future development. We are committed to rational and equitable treatment of all people occupying these leases. Aboriginal owners are an important part of the industry and they should regard themselves as having as much of an interest and obligation as fellow owners in the industry to ensuring that their fellows live up to their obligations in areas such as feral animal and pest control. They are very important obligations to be preserved and we see the terminology of this amendment as undercutting those obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a technical problem about this amendment. The states cannot be required to accept the surrender of a lease where its terms do not provide for this. The Commonwealth under those circumstances would have to acquire the underlying estate from the state in order to accept the surrender itself. I have tried to give some reasoned explanation for our position on those amendments. Regrettably, we cannot accept them and ask the committee to vote against them accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are five amendments before the chair. In relation to government amendment 20, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) gave fencing off as an example of the type of act that might be covered by the amendment. In a situation where land had been fenced off 50 or 100 years ago, would the mere fact of fencing off, however long ago it might have been, constitute exclusion? I ask the minister what else would need to be shown, given that he says that one would need to demonstrate a continuing association with the land. Surely the mere fact that land was fenced off at some time in the past is not sufficient.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be if the extinguishment of native title was, in effect, produced by such an action. That is the way my notes read. I am not entirely sure what that means in this context. Let me just discuss it with my advisers. The context in which a fencing could produce an extinguishment&mdash;this is using the word `extinguishment' in a rather different sense from the sense in which we have been using it so far, as attached to the grant of a particular interest in land&mdash;is really a loss of a capacity to claim a common-law right by virtue of losing a connection with the land in question. That means a drifting away, a losing of any sense of a kind of connection with the land that matters and still matters if a common-law claim is to be established. But the mere fact of fencing off by itself would not necessarily create that kind of a situation. It depends entirely on what the practical effect of that fencing has been. If, no matter what the fencing is, people have still been moving over the land, camping, hunting and doing various things there, it would simply be a matter of fact to identify what the implications of that have been.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other sorts of situations here that are mentioned in my note as being possible examples of the sort of thing that should be disregarded are the granting of easements or temporary pastoral leases to neighbouring properties.

When the lease is sold, you are left with a lot of land and some improvements, but the improvements are on land which is basically controlled by the body corporate or the native titleholders, so effectively the bank is selling a lease on some land which other people have control of. The strength of the collateral in most pastoral leases these days is pretty low. But the strength of the collateral the government is offering the banks is such that it is quite incredible to think it could even be considered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Otherwise than by this process, at conversion? Ordinary native title which is achieved by way of determination can be surrendered to the Crown, but is otherwise inalienable. I just checked on whether it is also applied to the native title equivalent situation that you could obtain in the context of a pastoral lease, and that is also surrenderable to the Crown. But it is otherwise inalienable. But remember: that is the native title interest, as distinct from the leasehold interest. The lease itself&mdash;which may well carry with it, and usually does, full-scale exclusive occupancy rights&mdash;is alienable, either voluntarily or in effect compulsorily, if it is a bank resumption in the event of a mortgage failing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to establish how an inalienable title stands in commercial terms, say, in the case of a pastoral lease. How can collateral be obtained for the development of that property? If the title is inalienable, how can it be offered as security? That is the crux of my question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question seems to be: if you have got a successful native title claim over previously vacant land, where there is no question of a continuing pastoral lease, what kind of collateral is available for the native titleholders to put up so as to attract a financial institution to lend on the strength of that? I suppose the short answer is that that collateral would not be especially attractive because it is inalienable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There will be other sources of finance presumably from ATSIC or possibly, conceivably, a land fund; although, whether that will be available to support improvements or whatever on land, as distinct from the purchase of land itself, is yet to be determined. However, there are some inhibitions. It is not intended that native title thus granted be able to be easily given away. It can be surrendered to the Crown, but that is it; otherwise, it is inalienable. The other situation we have been talking about relates to what one can do with a pastoral lease when one has a native title equivalent in association with a pastoral lease. That is a very different situation from a pure native title situation over land that does not have any leasehold interest associated with it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for clearing that up. But as far as that answer goes, I can see some problems for people who are holding a native title in getting to a position of commercial independence. My next question follows on from that. As I understand it, under the Mabo decision, if the traditional owners were to leave the area the native title would be extinguished. What is the position when native titleholders leave their area, particularly when the title is held by a body corporate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The mere fact that native title has been determined to exist and the mere fact that that native title interest happens to be vested in a body corporate which is in the existing statute, or the mere fact that it is held in some other way but with a body corporate playing a role as an agent and so on for native titleholders, would not affect the possibility of that native title being over time extinguished by loss of connection with the land over which the title has been obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible that in the future, just as has happened in the past, native title will be extinguished, will be lost, will just disappear in a situation where the relevant and necessary connection with the land, be it physical or spiritual or whatever, is in fact lost. I suppose it would be difficult to envisage that happening in a future where it is a matter of native title being newly established and determined and vested in a body corporate and so on, because it is hardly likely that people are going to let that go. However, it could be a very small community; maybe the members of it die out; maybe there is no-one left to maintain the continuity and in that way the native title is lost. That can happen in the future just as has happened in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the minister that it would be something that was rare rather than infrequent but it does establish the fact that there is more than one way in which native title could be extinguished: one is what he explained before, that is, when it can be sold to the government; the second one is where the connection is broken by virtue of the fact that the traditional owners decided to leave for whatever reason. There are two questions that arise from that. After leaving, for whatever reason, what would be a reasonable period of time before the native title would be extinguished, and are there any other ways by which native title can be extinguished?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot answer that question directly because the High Court has not given us a total set of guidelines for the way in which this will operate. This is a matter to be developed, I suppose, on a case-by-case adjudication by the High Court and, indeed, by the tribunals as to what will constitute the acquisition of native title and what might also constitute the loss of it. I simply cannot anticipate that. We are talking about common law with only one real case spelling it out and it is necessarily a process of evolution hereafter. I would like to be able to help the honourable senator further but I simply cannot. We have not been given enough guidance by the High Court so far to be able to reply fully to him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What this highlights is that we are now dealing with the government's response to the High Court decision, and that response has gone far beyond the High Court decision in many areas. I am saying to the minister that there are a lot of areas where he has felt it not necessary to be guided by the Mabo decision. I am not making a judgment in this comment one way or the other about that, but I am asking the minister, in view of the fact that he said that when extinguishment would be something for the tribunal to assess, whether there is any provision in the bill&mdash;and if there is, maybe he can help us&mdash;where that can actually happen. The position of the tribunal and the framework within which they can operate are spelt out pretty clearly, but I do not see any provision in the bill where they actually have that authority.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tribunal's job is to determine the status of claims that are made, applications that are made, for native title. All I am saying is that, in the course of determining those sorts of claims, some ground rules are bound to evolve about what kind of connection is sufficient to constitute a native title that ought to be recognised. No doubt there will also emerge some decisions about what kind of loss of connection with the particular land will lose what would otherwise perhaps constitute native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the tribunal has got the power under the legislation as drafted to specifically make a judgment that a newly granted native title right at some future time has been lost. I am not saying that it is in the bill in that form, but what I am saying is that the process of case by case determination of what constitutes a valid native title claim is bound to give us some guidelines, one presumes, over time as to the sort of connection that is necessary and what circumstances will lose that necessary connection. The court itself will no doubt have something to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded that actually we were talking about that earlier today, in relation to clause 12. There is provision to seek a revocation of an approved determination of native title. One such circumstance is where events have taken place since the determination was made that have caused the determination to be no longer correct, or the interests of justice require the variation or revocation of the determination. I suppose one such situation might be a small community where all the surviving members of it in fact die out without a continuity of a family line or some other physical manifestation of the interests in question. Under those circumstances a mining company or a pastoralist, or whatever, might seek a revocation of perhaps the native title right which remains notionally held in a body corporate but which no longer has any facts on which to bite. In that sort of circumstance maybe a body of case law that would affect that would evolve over time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge what the minister says in terms of clause 12. I have got to say I have great difficulty trying to work out precisely what it means and how it would be applied. But what it highlights is, once again, the enormous complexity which exists in terms of this bill. I think it also highlights that, even to the point that we have got to now in terms of the complexity and the inconsistencies, really to proceed further with this bill is just getting the minister deeper and deeper into water. It is time really to stop and have a look and reassess this legislation because it is very seriously flawed, as has been noted by many of the questions, and of course acknowledged by a lot out in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
