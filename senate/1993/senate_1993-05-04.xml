<PROCTEXT><PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His Excellency the Governor-General entered the chamber and, being seated, with the President on his right hand, commanded that a message be sent to the House of Representatives intimating that His Excellency desired the attendance of honourable members in the Senate chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members having come with their Speaker, His Excellency was pleased to deliver the following speech:</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable Members of the Parliament of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On March 13 the Labor Government received a mandate to continue the program of economic and social reform on which depend the future wellbeing of the nation and the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government sees as its primary task the encouragement of a strong and durable recovery from recession, assistance to those who have suffered as a consequence of the recession and a search for solutions to the increasing problem of long-term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The achievement of these goals very much depends on the successful completion of reforms undertaken by previous Labor governments over the past 10 years. Programs designed to make Australia a more creative and innovative manufacturing country, and one able to compete in the world are now showing unmistakable signs of success. In this next term the Government will continue with those economic reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will undertake, in particular, a major overhaul of the industrial relations system in such a way as to make Australian workplaces more flexible and competitive without reducing the wages, conditions and security of Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will continue to foster the economic integration of Australia with the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, and to encourage in the region an open and non-discriminatory trading environment. The  rewards for Australia and Asia are potentially immense, both for present and future generations of Australians, and the Government will make every effort on every relevant front to succeed in these endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that economic success should serve social ends, and indeed that economic success is substantially dependent on creating a fair and just society. It is the Government's continuing aim to extend opportunity while providing assistance to those who fall on hard times. The social safety net, including the universal health system, Medicare, in Australia will be maintained and strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a hallmark of successful, modern societies that education and training is both of a high quality and accessible to all. In this term, the new Australian National Training Authority will dramatically improve Australia's system of vocational training and, thereby, vastly extend the realm of educational and professional opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government takes the view that Australia's success as a robust social democracy and a strong and competitive economy  depends in no small way on a heightened sense of common national goals and nationhood. It believes our efforts to become a leading manufacturer and exporter of manufactures, no less than the rapid completion of major infrastructure projects, or the achievement of a lasting reconciliation with the Aboriginal people of Australia, or the extension of child-care facilities to Australian working families are directly related to our sense of a national Australian identity and a shared faith in our ability to achieve our goals.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has placed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues high on the nation's agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While much has been achieved in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in recent years, a great deal remains to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflecting the importance it attaches to  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, the Government is establishing an Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs with a policy advising capability within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission are now located in the Prime Minister's portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission has confirmed the faith shown in its creation. It remains the Government's primary adviser on indigenous issues, and the main Commonwealth body operating in the field of indigenous affairs. The Government will introduce amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 arising from the recent review of the legislation by Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The achievement of a lasting reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and the wider community will continue to be one of the Government's highest priorities. An effective partnership between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other Australians is fundamental to Australia's standing as a contemporary nation committed to human rights and social justice, and to the forging of a distinctive Australian identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will continue to promote a deeper understanding by all Australians of the history, cultures, past dispossession and continuing disadvantage of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, to foster an ongoing national commitment to cooperate to address that disadvantage and, after consulting the community, will advise on whether a formal document or documents of reconciliation would benefit the Australian community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is steadfast in its resolve to implement its commitments given in response to the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and will encourage the States and Territories to implement their commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court's decision on native title, known as the Mabo decision and handed down on 3 June 1992, overturned the myth of terra nullius and held that Australia's common law recognises a form of native title which survived European settlement. The nation's response to the decision is of fundamental importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and to the process of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to the view that the Mabo decision presents us with a genuine basis for reconciliation. This is, in the Government's view, a unique opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mabo decision goes to the core of the issue: dispossession. The High Court recognition of native title has profound consequences not just for land management but for contemporary issues of social justice and the process of reconciliation. The Mabo judgment is, in the Government's view, recognition of an historic truth and creates the best chance we have ever had for a nationally agreed and durable settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that this decision must, therefore, lead to us entering the 21st century with the fundamental relationship between the nation and its indigenous people rebuilt on fair and just foundations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has already initiated consultations on the decision, and will work to achieve a national response which takes into account the legitimate aspirations of all land holders, including native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Arts and Culture</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to bringing cultural concerns into the mainstream of decision making is reflected in the appointment of the minister with responsibility for arts and cultural development to a Cabinet position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will continue to give a high priority to the review of its role in Australia's cultural life, developing a cultural policy to be released by the end of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises its responsibility to maintain and develop Australian culture. It will encourage and assist what is distinctly Australian in our cultural life and it will do this in combination with two other goals. It will aim to conserve our heritage in all its diversity, recognising the heritage of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and that of the many ethnic, regional and social groups which make up our society. It will also aim to give all Australians, whatever their background, age, or wherever they live, access to varied cultural experiences and understandings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the arts, the Government will pursue these goals through continued strong support for its existing programs and through a series of new initiatives, some directed specifically at children and youth, which aim to promote excellence and innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will also pursue its cultural goals through a continuing commitment to the development of a distinctly Australian film and television industry. As a further stimulus to the creative endeavours of Australian film and television program-makers, the Government will give increased support in the key areas of script development, producer and marketing support and, importantly, Australian children's television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation's cultural heritage must be accessible to all Australians. A landmark step here will be the development of the National Museum of Australia. The Government will also pursue other important initiatives, including establishing the Foundation for Australian Cultural Development, which are designed to help all Australians locate themselves within their country's rich, ancient and diverse cultural landscape.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australian Economy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing unemployment remains the ultimate focus of all the Government's economic policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental to progress on this front will be the continued application of policy  settings that achieve the maximum sustainable rate of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all else, growth holds the key to reducing unemployment to more acceptable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years the Government has used fiscal policy to deliver a substantial boost to the economy. This has helped to stabilise activity and support the early stages of recovery. As the recovery proceeds and, in particular, private investment returns to more normal levels, the Government will withdraw that fiscal stimulus. The Government's aim is to reduce the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will also continue to keep inflation low. The considerable reduction in inflation which has occurred in recent years has resulted in lower inflationary expectations in the community and has enabled interest rates to be reduced to their lowest level in over twenty years. In turn, this provides a sound basis for encouraging the recovery which is now underway. Keeping inflation below that of our major trading partners will help to maintain Australia's competitiveness in world markets and therefore help to boost exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lowering inflation has not been without considerable cost, and it is therefore all the more important to ensure that the gains are not lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maintaining and raising competitiveness in world markets also depends on making the economy more efficient and raising productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, the Government remains fully committed to restructuring the Australian economy. To date, much has been achieved in microeconomic reform but much remains to be done particularly in cooperation with the States in areas such as electricity, gas, water and transportation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Open competition is central to the drive for increased efficiency and productivity. In transferring responsibility for competition  policy to the Treasury portfolio, the Government recognises the importance of effective competition for economic performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the National Competition Policy Review will be received shortly and the Government intends that they should be addressed vigorously by the Commonwealth and the States in order to develop open, integrated markets across the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will pay particular attention to the availability of finance, particularly to support innovation and product development and especially for small to medium sized businesses. For example, the Government will expand the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank and the Reserve Bank will strengthen its monitoring of bank lending to business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the superannuation area, the Government will reintroduce legislation to give effect to the improved prudential arrangements announced in the October 1992 Statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strengthening Super Security</EMPHASIS>. The new prudential framework will give added protection to superannuation savings, and encourage the development of a more efficient and responsive superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As another major initiative in financial supervision, the Government will update and further strengthen the regulation of the life insurance industry through amendments to the Life Insurance Act 1945 and related measures. These changes will not only enhance solvency and financial requirements for life offices, but also address many of the recommendations on consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's initiatives in superannuation and insurance, taken together, represent a major advance in consumer protection in the financial services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this Parliament, the Government will continue its reforms to the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has already legislated for the reductions in personal income tax rates  that will take effect during the life of this Parliament. The Government also intends to introduce legislation to give effect to the tax measures announced in the Prime Minister's statement of 9 February 1993, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS>. These measures include the reduction in the company tax rate, the changed timing for company tax payments, the general investment allowance and tax concessions for child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taken together, all these tax measures will improve both the equity of the tax system and the attractiveness of Australia as a location for the additional corporate investment which is essential for strong growth in employment.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Constitutional Reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government intends to continue the process of promoting discussion and debate on the appropriateness of having an Australian Head of State, chosen by Australians. To this end, the Government is setting up a broadly based committee of eminent Australians to advise on the minimum changes which would need to be made to the Constitution to achieve that result. The Government has invited the States and the Federal Opposition to participate in the work of the committee. After the committee's report, and the process of debate which will follow, the Government will consider whether there is sufficient consensus in the community to justify a referendum, which would enable Australia to become a republic by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is not opposed to examining other aspects of constitutional reform, but these should be considered separately and on their own merits.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Defence</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consolidation of Australia's national defence capabilities will continue to be the cornerstone of the Government's defence policy. Australian Defence Force activities will involve continuing close cooperation with our neighbours and allies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strategic review is currently under way and a Defence White Paper will be published  next year outlining force structure and investment priorities for the 1990s. The program of long-term restructuring already in train will result in a more capable self-reliant Defence Force and increasing involvement of Australian industry in equipping and maintaining the Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment in defence capital equipment and facilities will see nearly $2 billion invested in Australia each year over the next ten years. The first Collins-class submarine will be launched later this year. This is a significant landmark in Australian defence industry construction and demonstrates the skills and ability of the Australian workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's review of defence policy for industry, completed last year, will see a renewed focus on defence industry exports. The Commercial Support Program will continue to have a high priority as the Government seeks to increase private sector involvement with the Australian Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of defence infrastructure in the north and west will remain a priority with the continued development of RAAF Base Scherger near Weipa, the relocation of elements of the Army to Darwin and Townsville and the expansion of the Navy presence in the west.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High priority will continue to be given to enhancing the living conditions of Service personnel by upgrading military bases and barracks as well as Defence housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Organisation will continue to play its part in the process of microeconomic reform. Success in this is essential if the Government is to achieve its objective of creating a more efficient and capable force for the defence of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Employment, Education and Training</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is the greatest problem that we face. Reducing unemployment and assisting those who are unemployed is the Government's  first priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that the problem of long-term unemployment will require special attention over the next three years. The incidence of long-term unemployment has risen sharply and experience from the 1980s indicates that it will not fall quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Government will not accept long-term unemployment as an insoluble problem. As employment growth picks up, it is essential that those who have been unemployed for a long time are given the assistance they need to obtain jobs. As a first step, the Government will review all labour market programs to ensure that funds are directed to those programs which are the most effective at getting people jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the problem, we also acknowledge that new policies and practices may have to be developed. The Government has begun work on these issues and will seek the assistance of business, unions, community groups and other interested people in finding solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people who are unemployed face a special set of problems. These were discussed at the Youth Employment and Training Summit in Canberra last year. In response to the issues raised, the Government announced a National Employment and Training Plan for Young Australians with measures costing $770 million over three years. The Government will review the success of those measures in the coming months to ensure they are delivering to young people the vocational education, training and employment experience that was intended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that unemployed people are given every opportunity to maintain links with the labour market. The Government will introduce a number of changes to income test and waiting period arrangements for Job Search, Newstart and Sickness Allowance which will better enable these recipients to supplement their income support payments through part-time and casual employment. This will encourage them to maintain links with the  labour market, thereby improving their chances of gaining ongoing substantial employment as the economy improves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the difficulties older unemployed people face in gaining employment the Government will be introducing a provisional age pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's reforms in education and training have substantially increased participation in schools and higher education. We have also put in place arrangements which will allow for the expansion and upgrading of vocational education and training. The Commonwealth has passed legislation to establish the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) and Commonwealth and State funding is to be directed through ANTA from 1 January 1994. The Government will build on this expanded base and ensure that our education and training policies enable Australia's workforce to become a major source of competitive advantage while providing individuals with the knowledge and skills that they need to live a fulfilling life. The Government will also ensure that recent moves to improve links among the various education sectors are strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to a major review of programs to redress the educational disadvantage of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. This review will shape the face of indigenous education for the lead up to the Centenary of Australian Federation in 2001.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Environment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The environment is now of mainstream concern throughout the Australian community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the overall context of implementing the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development, during this term the Government will continue to implement a comprehensive range of environmental  protection programs including: strengthening Commonwealth involvement in conserving water resources, including those of the Murray-Darling river system;  working towards a nationally comprehensive and representative system of parks and reserves using consistent management principles;  developing the National Pollutant Inventory in cooperation with the States and Territories;  preparing national standards for air and water quality through the establishment of the National Environment Protection Authority;  and taking effective measures to address the issue of environmental lead levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to international environment issues, the Government will place priority on the further development of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, noting the particular interests engendered by our high level of economic dependence on energy intensive activities. Australia will promote acceptance under the Convention of cooperative approaches between the parties to achieving comprehensive greenhouse gas emission controls. The Government will ratify the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and continue to respond positively to the other outcomes of the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consolidation of Australia's economic integration into the Asia Pacific Region especially by further developing regional economic cooperation and trade and investment liberalisation through APEC, by active pursuit of bilateral trade expansion strategies, and by further building Australia's official trade and diplomatic presence in the region will be a high priority for the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of measures to promote closer economic relations with Asia and, in particular, to assist Australian exports to the region, the Government, in cooperation with the private sector, will establish the Asian Economic Centre. The Centre will increase business knowledge of economic  developments in major export markets in Asia and will operate with the close involvement of the private sector to ensure its service meets business requirements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am required to rule on two matters of privilege raised with me by senators since the Senate last met. Pursuant to standing order 81 and privilege resolution 4, I am required to determine whether a motion to refer the matters to the Privileges Committee should have precedence over other business, having regard to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(a)the principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for senators against improper acts tending substantially to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b)the existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By letter dated 29 January 1993 Senator Walters has raised with me a matter of privilege. The essence of the matter raised by Senator Walters is that a person has allegedly threatened to publish certain supposed information concerning Opposition members of parliament if the Opposition members adopt a certain policy in relation to X-rated videos. Senator Walters refers to certain press reports containing the alleged threats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possible contempt of parliament contained in the matter raised by Senator Walters is that of seeking by threats to influence senators in their conduct as senators. This is one of the well-known contempts of parliament, and is referred to in privilege resolution 6 under the heading `Improper Influence of Senators'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alleged threat is directed to Opposition members generally and not to any particular person, but it is well established that a threat to unnamed members, or to a group or category of members, or to members in general, can be a contempt just as can a threat to particular members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alleged threat as reported is also directed to Opposition members of parliament generally, and does not distinguish between members and senators. If the threat as reported were made, it could be regarded as being directed to senators as well as members of the House of Representatives. This is so particularly having regard to the fact that senators could, and probably would, participate in the formulation of any policies relating to X-rated videos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The formulation of such a policy by a group of senators clearly falls within their duties as senators and their conduct as senators within the terms of privilege resolution 6. A threat such as the one reported obviously has the potential substantially to obstruct senators in the performance of their functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter raised by Senator Walters therefore is clearly capable of being regarded by the Senate as meeting criterion (a) which I am required to take into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to criterion (b), the availability of another remedy for the act which is the subject of the complaint, if there is another remedy, is not clearly or readily available. It may be that, if the alleged threat were made, a prosecution for certain criminal offences could ensue, but it would be a difficult and uncertain process for senators to bring about such a prosecution. A civil suit undertaken after the alleged threat had been carried out and the supposed information published would not be a satisfactory remedy. I therefore think that there is not a readily available other remedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By letter dated 20 April 1993, Senator Reynolds, as chair of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Telecommunications Technologies, has also raised with me a matter of privilege pursuant to standing order 81.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter relates to a letter addressed to the committee by a spokesperson of a company called Eros Foundation. One paragraph of the letter contains what appears to be a threat that unless the committee makes some `reassessment' of its findings, actions for damages will be undertaken, presumably against the committee or individual members of the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this interpretation of the paragraph is correct, the paragraph would clearly be capable of being held to be a threat made against a Senate committee and its members in the performance of their duty and therefore a contempt. It is well established that a threat to take legal action made with the purpose of influencing a committee or its members, or actually taking legal action for that purpose, can constitute a contempt.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 9 January 1993, of the Rt Hon. Sir Paul Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck KG, GCMG, GCVO, Governor-General of Australia from 1969 to 1974, member for Curtin from 1949 to 1969, Minister for External Affairs from 1964 to 1969, Minister for Defence from 1963 to 1964 and Minister for Territories from 1951 to 1963; and that the Senate places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Paul Hasluck was born on 1 April 1905 at Perth, Western Australia and educated at the Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia. He began his working life in 1922 as a journalist for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, where he distinguished himself by twice winning that State's Lovekin prize for journalism. From there he took up a post as a temporary lecturer in history at the University of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He joined the Department of External Affairs in 1941. In his six years in the department, he travelled on diplomatic assignments to Canada, New Zealand, the United States and Britain, culminating in the post of counsellor in charge of the Australian mission to the United Nations in New York. Sir Paul resigned in 1947 and returned to the University of Western Australia as a reader in history, contracting to write two volumes of the official war history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year 1949 saw him enter Federal politics. He stood for and won the seat of Curtin and became the Minister for Territories some 15 months later, remaining in that portfolio until 1963. He subsequently became, as the motion states, Minister for Defence and Minister for External Affairs. He held the seat of Curtin for 20 years and was on the front bench of successive Liberal/Coalition governments for 18 of those years. It was a distinguished parliamentary career by any reckoning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not have the privilege of knowing Sir Paul personally, but as it happens my senior adviser, Geoff Bentley, worked as his Private Secretary in the mid-1960s. Mr Bentley recently wrote for my department a memoir on Sir Paul as external affairs Minister, from which I think it is worth quoting a few passages:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Paul was a tireless worker and prepared much of his own briefing, often calling for files to work on himself. He was among those of our ministers who have demanded the highest standards and who have achieved them. He believed in careful research and precision and clarity in drafting; unexplained acronyms were a particular hate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seemingly formal and aloof, Hasluck was personally modest and unassuming with little time for humbug and pomposity. In a quiet and unobtrusive way he encouraged many younger officers. Away from work he enjoyed a yarn&mdash;particularly about rugby&mdash;and he and those around him were genuinely at ease visiting aid projects in the backblocks of Thailand and Vietnam. It was not surprising then that he enjoyed the easiest of rapport with Asian leaders. He was concerned&mdash;at times too concerned&mdash;not to impose Australia's will on Asian decision making, and by today's standards might be thought less than persistent in pursuit of our agenda. On one occasion he complained that a division head wanted him to put an Asian president on the ropes when, first up, he only wanted to get to know the fellow. That evening, at the president's banquet in Hasluck's honour, they both played in the band.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our world then was dominated by an unpredictable Sukarno and Indonesia's "Confrontation" of Malaysia, Singapore's separation from Malaysia, British military withdrawal east of Suez, Chairman Mao and the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, involvement in Vietnam and the theology that our northern neighbours were dominoes in danger of falling before the communist menace.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then, as now, work in and on the Asian region was demanding and professionally satisfying. Despite the testing issues, the early post-colonial period was marked by warm relationships. Apart from Australian MPs being able to call routinely on the likes of the Tunku and Lee Kuan Yew, we had access and expertise that both the Americans and British envied. Our embassies joined the top rung in most Asian countries and perhaps for the first time it was recognised that Australia could carve out its "destiny" in the region. Looking back, life must have been simpler and the foreign policy agenda not so vast. After all the then Department of External Affairs, including the forerunners of AIDAB and the Overseas Property Group, occupied a mere three floors in one of the 4 blocks of the present Foreign Affairs and Trade building and boasted just one photocopier. It was with few resources at his disposal that Sir Paul Hasluck laid some of the groundwork for where we are in Asia today.</PARA>
<PARA>That memoir ought to be acknowledged. Sir Paul went on to serve as Governor-General of Australia from 1969 to 1974. It was also during this period that he was able to complete the second of the volumes of the official war history that he had contracted to do back in 1947. From 1974 onwards he returned to his writing and produced several works&mdash;historical pieces; essays; his popular autobiography entitled, rather implausibly, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mucking About</EMPHASIS>; and a number of books of poetry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Journalist, lecturer, writer, public servant, diplomat, politician and vice regal representative&mdash;in all roles Sir Paul Hasluck maintained the highest standards of integrity, honesty and loyalty. He worked unstintingly in the service of Australia and the Australian people. He will be remembered as a great, indeed an outstanding, Australian. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his wife, Alexandra, and to the family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Opposition senators I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Evans) in expressing our regret at the death in January at the age of 87 of former Governor-General and Minister, Sir Paul Hasluck. Sir Paul Hasluck's life was one of most distinguished service and contribution to the Australian community in all of his various careers&mdash;as a journalist, diplomat, historian, author, Minister and Governor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul began his career as a journalist with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. As I understand it, in 1941, at the urging of an old friend and journalist colleague, John Curtin, he joined the Department of External Affairs and was a senior member of the Australian delegation to the San Francisco conference, which led to the formation of the United Nations. In 1946 he was appointed Counsellor in Charge of the Australian mission to the United Nations. He became a Liberal member of Parliament in 1949 and represented the people of the division of Curtin for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within 15 months of being elected, Sir Paul was appointed Minister for Territories in the Menzies Government, a position which he held for 12 years from 1951 to 1963. During this time he played an important role in the eventual independence of Papua New Guinea. After a short period as Minister for Defence, from 1963 to 1964, Sir Paul was given the external affairs portfolio, and he held this ministry from 1964 to 1969. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible, according to some, that, but for his reluctance to engage in what some refer to as number crunching in politics, he might well have become Prime Minister in January 1968. Sir Paul was appointed Governor-General in 1969 and retired in 1974. In all of his roles&mdash;journalist, author, historian, diplomat, Minister and Governor-General&mdash;Sir Paul was distinguished by his great integrity and formidable intellect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think he could be fairly described as a reformer. In many respects, particularly in his concern for Aboriginal welfare and in his interest in the Asia-Pacific region, he was well ahead of his time. When he spoke of his own career, it was his work as Minister for Territories, particularly in Aboriginal welfare, which gave him most satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In international relations he held the view that the problems of peace were global and that it was Australia's role to ensure that the Asia-Pacific region was not forgotten by the great powers. Another factor which influenced policy making at the time was the perceived need to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of newly independent states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sir Paul's internationalist approach and his focus on Asia really form the basis on which Australian foreign policy has since developed. It was a revolutionary redirection in our outlook and a fundamental reassessment of our place in the world. There are few Australians whose talents have been so diverse and who have contributed so richly to the development of our nation. On behalf of coalition senators, I extend our most sincere condolences to his widow and family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to offer the condolences of the Australian Democrats to the family of Sir Paul Hasluck, who died in Perth on 10 January this year. It will not surprise honourable senators to know that I never met Sir Paul during his long and distinguished life. In fact, to me he was an important figure in an era when I believe I was just becoming a little more politically conscious. He was someone whose contribution to this nation was already passing into history by that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking over the many things that have been written about and by Sir Paul Hasluck, it is clear that he was motivated by clear principles, many of which I feel a strong identification with. For his time, the young Paul Hasluck was unusually sensitive to, and aware of, the plight of Aboriginal people. It has been said that he supported what was then called assimilation on the grounds that the alternative would have been some form of apartheid. As questionable as his preference may look from the vantage point of 1993, I think there is no question that his motives were humane and honourable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Minister and Governor-General, Sir Paul showed an unusually deep and philosophical grasp of the importance of a strong parliamentary democracy and Public Service. One of the ironies of history is the suggestion that had he been Governor-General at the time of the 1975 constitutional crisis, it would have been resolved in a more appropriate way. The irony lies, of course, in the fact that he was appointed by a Liberal-National government, while his controversial successor was a Labor appointee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul's parliamentary philosophy valued the competition of ideas but recognised the need for an overarching unity of purpose and commitment to national development. In his first speech, he warmly acknowledged the positive influence of his friend and former colleague, John Curtin. His incapacity or unwillingness to submerge himself in the rough and tumble of parliamentary politics was seen by some as a weakness and by others as a virtue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to extend my sympathies to Sir Paul Hasluck's family and associate myself and National Party senators with the condolence motion moved by the Government. Sir Paul Hasluck was a skilled historian, a fine statesman, and a loving husband and father. He started his career as a journalist and entered public life in 1941 when he joined the Department of External Affairs after a chance meeting with his old friend, John Curtin. The department in those days had eight professional staff and occupied about 10 rooms in the West Block building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1946, Sir Paul led the Australian mission to the United Nations but resigned from the department the following year after a dispute with the then leader of the government, H.V. Evatt. Sir Paul drifted into Parliament in 1949 after the West Australian Liberal and Country League asked him to stand for the seat of Curtin. He accepted the invitation after some indecision and began to build his career as one of the most unusual and thoughtful politicians of his time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul's attitude to his new profession was tempered by his deep scepticism about the value of the conventional rewards of political life. He realised very early in his career that the pomps of this world are fleeting and that political fame and glory melt away. He said in his autobiography:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suffered from a lack of identity with those who seemed to find politics wholly satisfying, and who felt that a political triumph, achieved by any means, was the chief end of man.</PARA>
<PARA>He developed a reputation as a diffident man who disliked speaking to the media and at one stage the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> complained that he `behaved like a Trappist monk'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul's first ministerial portfolio was the Territories ministry which he held from 1951 to 1963. His greatest achievement in the portfolio was undoubtedly the expansion of representative government in Papua New Guinea, both at the local and at the territorial level. His policies were controversial but laid the groundwork for the successful democracy that Papua New Guinea has today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul was appointed Minister for External Affairs in 1964 after a brief sojourn in Defence. He established an impressive international reputation, particularly in Asia, although he never achieved&mdash;nor did he seek&mdash;a particularly high profile here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul was appointed Governor-General in 1969 and, from the start, was determined to take an activist role. He believed, as I do, that the Governor-General should act as a brake on the Executive's enthusiasms. He did not believe that the Governor-General could impose his own ideas on the government, but rather that the Governor-General should ask questions, encourage, and ensure that the government's decisions were in accordance with the Constitution and the law. He closely followed the process of government administration through extensive discussions with his three Prime Ministers, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam. He later said that they were prepared to seek his advice because they knew that he had extensive political experience and because they knew that he did not have his own political agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul paid particularly close attention to the Executive Council minutes that passed across his desk and did not hesitate to question proposals that seemed to him to be poorly considered. He later said that he rejected, on average, two or three out of every 100 Executive Council proposals because they were not properly put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Sir Paul's attention to detail considerably enhanced the quality of public administration during his term in office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with a deep sense of personal sorrow to support this motion of condolence on the recent death of Sir Paul Hasluck. Probably unlike anybody else here, I knew Paul Hasluck personally for a number of years. I first knew him when he stood for the seat of Curtin in 1949, but I really did not get to know him until later when I became an office bearer of a Liberal Party branch in his electorate. Following some years in that role, I became president of the Curtin division.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that period of eight years or so, I worked very closely with Sir Paul Hasluck. I came to have a very high respect and regard for him, as one would naturally experience for a man of such outstanding attainments and qualities. I do not wish to repeat all those qualities; they were very well summarised by earlier speakers on this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a misunderstanding about Paul Hasluck's nature as a remote figure, probably unsuited to politics. The fact was that, apart from having a very acute social conscience and sense of public duty, Paul Hasluck also got on extraordinarily well with ordinary people. The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) made that point by referring to a memo from a person who knew him very well. Sir Paul was a very good grassroots politician in the sense of being able to handle seriously the problems of his constituents. He made that a priority. He had a fairly good patch of grass to care for in the Curtin electorate as a Liberal. He always stressed to me that a member of parliament cannot write people too many letters. He was a great believer in letter writing. Obviously, the Government has adopted that view as well, with its generous postage allowance&mdash;something which I am sure Sir Paul would have made the best use of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul Hasluck listened very closely to people. I worked with him in several election campaigns in the electorate of Curtin. He was a great believer in going out and meeting people on street corners; he favoured that very much. I was able to see another side of him&mdash;a different side from the historical model. I rose today to emphasise that particular aspect of him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul Hasluck had a tremendous sense of dedication to any job he took on. He was particularly dedicated to the people of Papua New Guinea, for whom he was responsible for 12 of the 18 years that he was a Minister of state of the Commonwealth. In those years he laboured tremendously for the advancement of the people of Papua New Guinea and succeeded very effectively. He made great contact with people, rather than being just an administrator. </PARA>
<PARA>In regard to Sir Paul's qualifications for political office, despite all the other qualifications he had which have been mentioned&mdash;as an author, poet, historian and so on; all qualities which are not usually associated with successful politicians&mdash;he was a very successful Minister and politician. It often troubled me that he was not more recognised&mdash;certainly not recognised for the leadership of the Liberal Party. When the opportunity came his way after the death of Harold Holt, it seemed to be clear that he was the person to whom the Liberal Party should have turned. I have often speculated what benefits we as a party may have had had that right decision been made early in 1968. We certainly would have been spared some very embarrassing moments, with the untidy demise of John Gorton and the prime ministership of Billy McMahon. Whether he would have won the 1972 election is another matter. At least he would have kept the Liberal Party in much better shape through a very difficult period of our history. However, I do not want to speak today about those particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After he retired from public life, Sir Paul Hasluck remained extraordinarily active. He took up all sorts of small causes. He travelled a good deal; I often used to run into him travelling from west to east, but he did not spend long away from home. He spent a lot of his time at his home and at his small property in the hills behind Perth. Another important side of him was that he was a deep lover of nature; he was also a very keen and active horseman until his later years. It is with great sorrow that I have to speak on his death. I extend my deepest sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sir Paul Hasluck will be remembered by many as the unpolitical politician who nearly became Prime Minister of Australia in 1968. Yet Sir Paul, who disliked the wheeling and dealing of politics, left an even greater legacy to this country as a journalist, historian, university lecturer, diplomat, politician and Governor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Born into a Salvation Army family in Perth in 1905, he joined the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper at the age of 17 and later lectured at the University of Western Australia. As has already been mentioned by my Senate colleagues, he entered politics in 1949 as the member for Curtin and, within 15 months of being elected, was appointed Minister for Territories, a portfolio he held for 12 years. This therefore brought him a very close relationship and partnership with the constituency that I represent&mdash;that is, the Northern Territory. In 1963, Sir Paul was made Minister for Defence and, a year later, the politician who hated politics was promoted by Sir Robert Menzies to the crucial post of Minister for External Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet Sir Paul remained an enigma. A brilliant Minister, he was a private man who believed that merit should bring its own reward and that it was undignified to have to persuade people of the fact. On one occasion, in 1974, the usually reserved Sir Paul announced that Australians were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . less distinctively Australian than they had been for 100 years.</PARA>
<PARA>In comments that could apply to Prime Minister Keating's current republican debate, Sir Paul said that Australians were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . crying aloud in the middle of the night with our own disturbing version of Australian roosterdom.</PARA>
<PARA>Importantly, Sir Paul believed that the Northern Territory could, and eventually would, manage its own affairs. This was demonstrated in the changes he initiated and supported in the structure of the Northern Territory Legislative Council as well as the progressive transfer of responsibilities to the Administrator and his council from the Department of Territories in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Sir Paul made it patently clear to his officers in Canberra that administration as well as policy proposals from the Territory Administrator would be adopted unless there were compelling reasons to the contrary. This led to friction between the Administrator and his officers and the department's secretary and his officers. However, Sir Paul's judgment and wisdom were such that he could effectively balance strong and competing interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time in the 1950s, I was a teenager in the Northern Territory. I can certainly recall Sir Paul being one of my political icons. Naturally, he was well publicised in the Northern Territory. I can certainly recall meeting him on a number of occasions personally and feeling very challenged by both his presence and the activities that he undertook. He had a close relationship with my father in developing Aboriginal education, also in the early 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Harry Giese, a retired senior Commonwealth public servant still living in Darwin, recalls that one of Sir Paul's first tasks in the Northern Territory was to assist the transfer of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies to Darwin from Melbourne. According to Mr Giese, Sir Paul subsidised linguists from the institute to study and record some of the 103 Aboriginal languages spoken in the Territory. It was the first concentrated effort to record Aboriginal languages in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the wide geographic and administrative diversity of the territories portfolio, Sir Paul maintained close contact with department heads in the Northern Territory, regularly joining them on field trips. In 1958, Sir Paul made the first major change in the composition of the Northern Territory's Legislative Council by appointing some non-official members, letting members elect their own president and generally extending the authority of the Administrator. Certainly in his later capacity as Governor-General he took a very keen and continuing interest in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul will also be remembered for his lifetime interest in Aboriginal affairs, an interest that led him to complete a master's degree on Aboriginal policy in 1936 and establish a group designed to promote Aboriginal interests. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> earlier this year described Sir Paul as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not an architect of assimilation, though he always defended it, particularly against what he regarded as its opposition&mdash;apartheid; he believed in rights for Aborigines, fought against prejudice, and argued that Aboriginal development depended on education, training and access to services.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pay tribute to the distinguished career of Sir Paul Hasluck and extend my condolences to the Hasluck family. I cannot recall ever meeting Sir Paul, although as a member of the Liberal students at the University of Melbourne and subsequently an active member of the Liberal Party I, of course, closely followed his career and his contributions to public affairs. The extensive writings of Sir Paul Hasluck make it easy to refresh one's memory about the man, his attitudes and his impact on great events. Indeed, in the last week I have had the opportunity to read some of the articles written by Sir Paul and look at some of the books that he published. In my view, his thoughts are often particularly pertinent in light of the issues which have come before this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the themes which comes through the remarks that others have made today, and which is certainly backed up by my own readings, is that few, if any, men in our political life have had as much of the intellectual in their make-up as Sir Paul. His interests ranged across the theatre, literature and music, and he was also an avid collector of Australiana. In the last year, at the age of 87, he published a series of articles in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> dealing with changes in social mores in Australia over his lifetime. The articles covered the topics of gambling, thrift, conversation and religion and he compared the attitudes and conventions of his childhood and early adulthood with those that he observed in contemporary Australia. The overwhelming impression one gets from reading those articles is that he felt something of the essence of Australian life had been lost and that we were the worse for the losing of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He clearly had a sense of unease about the changes he perceived. As Sir Walter Crocker said in his own tribute to Sir Paul Hasluck in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was uneasy and apprehensive about certain tendencies in Australian life and culture, such as increases in dishonesty, in violence and in intolerance . . . and the decline in the mass media, not least in the press. The debasement of the English language in Australia in recent years was an alarm bell for him.</PARA>
<PARA>His uneasiness with what he perceived to be the debasement of Australian life is reflected in his general concern about attitudes to and proposals for changing the Australian Constitution and, more specifically, to the standards observed by parliamentarians. Sir Paul was very strongly of the view that the Constitution as it stands is both strong and adaptable. His view was that, so long as it was treated with respect and good sense, its endurance would ensure continued good government. His thoughts are worthy of careful consideration as, while not a constitutional lawyer, he was well versed in constitutional history and the workings of government. In the 1992 Sir Samuel Griffith lecture, Sir Paul reflected:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our biggest worries in the government of Australia are not whether the text of the Constitution is perfect but whether we have the wisdom&mdash;or even enough plain commonsense&mdash;to govern our nation wisely.</PARA>
<PARA>In the same lecture he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Constitution has given a sound basic structure, system of government and the political institutions for handling the changes that have taken place in Australia during the century. It has proved sufficiently adaptable to meet the changing needs of an emerging and evolving nation. Our Constitution is not an outworn obstacle to political wisdom or administrative skill. I can see no strength in arguments that we need a new Constitution or a new system of government even if there are very strong arguments for the need for some adjustments to meet changes.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Paul's views on the debate surrounding Australia's Constitution and system of government extend into the contentious area of standards to be observed and respected by parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the speech delivered to the Samuel Griffith Society, Sir Paul decried what he referred to as the `weakening, and in some cases total disregard, of the unwritten conventions in our Constitution'. He pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . respect for the conventions as well as the text of the Constitution is a basic requirement of parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>In earlier days, he recalled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Minister resigned if he was found to have misled Parliament; in the process of the introduction and passage of all stages of a Bill and transmission from one chamber to another sufficient time was allowed for debate; question time was an opportunity to obtain information and not to have another donnybrook brawl.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Kernot drew that issue to our attention today, and I agree with her remarks. Importantly, he highlighted the need for `recognition and respect of the place in a bicameral system of each chamber'. In this context he expressed his particular consternation about Mr Keating's derogatory references to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul rejected the so-called `dash for cash' mentality, maintaining throughout his public life a strict sense of duty about the spending of public money. As a Minister, he eschewed the perks of political life. A profile of him which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> in 1968 emphasised this facet of the man, stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He seldom uses VIP aircraft and drives his own ageing Peugeot station wagon to Parliament House instead of using a Commonwealth car.</PARA>
<PARA>As an ex-Governor-General, entitled to a number of services paid for by the taxpayer, he remained scrupulously frugal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His views on what he felt to be the deterioration in parliamentary standards are perhaps best summed up in the last few lines of a poem he wrote and published recently.

I have another quote from that speech, which was an embodiment of Sir Paul's views. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My only purpose has been to support the propositions that Australia has undergone great changes during the century; that Australia today is a nation-state vastly different from the collection of colonies that federated in 1901; that the issues we faced and the policies that we had to shape throughout the century were perpetually changing; and above all else the future will be much more brutally challenging to us than the past. Through all this, it is not the Constitution that has hampered us in the handling of public affairs or prevented governments from working together. The lesson is not that we can only prosper if we write a new text or make major amendments to the old one but rather we need higher political skill and forbearance in using our Constitution.</PARA>

<PARA>The assassination of Ranasinghe Premadasa on 1 May was an appalling act of violence which deserves the condemnation of all Australians. It was a tragedy for Sri Lanka and for its people. Ranasinghe Premadasa was a popular president, a man of humble origins with a genuine concern for the poor and underprivileged. The economic reforms which he promoted with such vigour have done much to open up the Sri Lankan economy and to encourage investment in the development of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his very last speech President Premadasa referred to the unprecedented pace of progress in his country over the last four years and the great transformation taking place there. Under his presidency, the record on human rights in Sri Lanka improved dramatically. When I met him in Colombo in August 1990, he impressed me with his commitment to improving human rights in Sri Lanka. He had worked hard to increase awareness of and respect for human rights, recognising that his government and the armed forces needed to very much improve the application of basic human rights in that country. Even through the serious problems which beset peace in Sri Lanka, he remained tied to reconciliation and peaceful processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His violent death, coming so soon after the assassination of the Leader of the Opposition, Athulathmudali, last week places very great renewed pressure on peace in Sri Lanka. As President Premadasa said, again in his last speech:</PARA>

<PARA>It is sad indeed that a man who expressed such peaceful sentiments should die so violently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from his significant domestic achievements, President Premadasa will be remembered for the new friendships he formed within the south Asia region in his capacity as Chairman of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in 1992 and his success in significantly improving India-Sri Lanka relations through his close relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I support the motion moved by Senator Evans and express our deepest sympathy to the family of the late President Premadasa of Sri Lanka. President Premadasa's tragic assassination at the age of 68 deprives Sri Lanka of a strong leader committed to the well-being of his nation. The violence of his death is abhorrent and anathema to peace loving peoples worldwide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did, as Senator Evans said, make a substantial contribution to his country, showing genuine concern for the poor. But, of course, this work was to the background of the ongoing and very severe ethnic conflict. </PARA>

In the past 10 years it has been reported that up to 28,000 people have been killed in the conflict which, as I said, shows few signs of diminishing. It is unlikely that military victory by either side will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record of human rights violations as taken by the United Nations makes really quite appalling reading. The United Nations working group on forced or involuntary disappearances recorded some 12,000 disappearances in Sri Lanka between 1983 and 1992&mdash;the highest number ever recorded for any single country. This report confirmed the findings of Amnesty International which, in turn, reported evidence of gross violations of human rights and large-scale executions and disappearances, particularly in the north east of the country where the fighting is concentrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that President Premadasa's death does not signal the start of another spiral of violence. But, coming so quickly, as Senator Evans said, after the death of the Leader of the Opposition, one cannot be too hopeful. There will also be the consequence of further pressure on a country which, in some ways, has been improving economically but is still one of the world's poorest 20 countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, when we remember President Premadasa and we look at the tragic situation in Sri Lanka, I put to the Senate that we should again look to a role in which the international community might be able to help Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people to bring an end to this ongoing agony. This is something that I, personally, have sought, particularly with efforts by the Commonwealth, and I acknowledge that Senator Evans raised these issues with President Premadasa a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, he, as most proud leaders do, took the view that his country should be able to resolve this problem itself. The Commonwealth, which I thought was the most appropriate body to help Sri Lanka in this instance, took the view that it should not offer its assistance unless its help was requested by the Government of Sri Lanka. Therefore, a stalemate developed, and the international community has not been able to make the contribution that I think it can make and, furthermore, which I think is necessary if Sri Lanka is to be helped through this tragic situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that on this occasion the Australian Government might resolve to make a further effort to encourage the Commonwealth, the United Nations or other international bodies to at least have the confidence to make representations to the Government of Sri Lanka, offering to be of assistance in an effort to mediate a settlement and perhaps provide constitutional advice or other help that could overcome the communal differences in Sri Lanka, and bring this terrible civil war and the destructive consequences that the Sri Lankan people have been suffering for so long to an end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, when we remember with deep regret the assassination of the late President of Sri Lanka as part of this ongoing cycle of violence in his country, I trust that we will take the opportunity to encourage the international community to see whether there are ways in which we can help Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan people to bring this cycle of violence to an end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the condolence motion on behalf of the Australian Democrats and, in doing so, deplore the violent and brutal way in which Sri Lanka's President Premadasa was assassinated a week ago. Last week the world witnessed yet another tragic episode in Sri Lanka's recent turbulent history.

<PARA>Professor Fred Hollows's enormous contribution to Australia and the world, both as an ophthalmologist and as a human being passionately concerned with the welfare of the distressed and dispossessed, wherever they might be, will be very long remembered. It is only fitting that we honour him today through this condolence motion. He joins those few other special Australians who have been similarly honoured in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Hollows was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on 9 April 1929. In his early years he thought he might become a minister of religion or perhaps a psychologist, but never really imagined that he would enter the field of medicine. It was not until he was offered a place at the University of Otago to study medicine, at age 22, that he first thought seriously of such a career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became interested in eye surgery and by 1961 went off to the UK to complete his Diploma of Ophthalmology. He spent some time working in Wales before coming out to Australia in 1965 to head the Ophthalmology Department at the University of New South Wales. With Fred's urging it was not long before there was a separate eye clinic at the Prince of Wales Hospital. By this stage Fred Hollows had adopted Australia as his home and his work with Aboriginal people, for which he was so well known, had begun. First, there was the establishment of the Aboriginal Medical Centre at Redfern and then the national trachoma and eye health program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Hollows developed a tremendous affection for and rapport with the Aboriginal people. He and his team travelled the length and breadth of the country treating Aboriginal people in remote areas, continuing the fight for improvements to their living conditions and access to medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From early 1987 onwards he extended his program to the Third World. He managed to establish clinics and training programs in Eritrea, Nepal and Vietnam. He acted as a consultant in the extension of his surgical techniques to places such as Bangladesh, Burma, Tibet and various parts of Latin America. Fred's plan was not merely to train local doctors in the surgical techniques, but to build the factories to make intra-ocular lenses. He saw this as the only way of making eye surgery and lenses readily available to the poor of these countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His aspirations are now well on the way to being realised, with lenses factories soon to be in operation in Vietnam, Nepal and Eritrea.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Hollows was a passionate man with deeply held convictions. His politics were to the left of the Labor Party&mdash;even the Victorian branch&mdash;and he gave politicians of all stripes and colours, including me, a consistently hard time. He had a wholesome hatred of red tape and he avoided bureaucrats wherever possible, preferring instead to deal with those directly involved. When it came to Ministers, however, whatever we did do&mdash;whether it was with the aid program or anything else&mdash;was never quite enough. Fred always wanted more, but, of course, it was always because he wanted to help more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While to his patients Fred Hollows was unfailingly generous and compassionate, his relations with most others were a little more robust. He was forthright&mdash;some would go so far as to say rough as guts&mdash;and his methods often quite unorthodox. His professional colleagues were certainly not spared the acid of his tongue; not least at the memorable conference organised by the College of Ophthalmologists in his honour when he told them&mdash;and I hope you will forgive the expression in this context, Mr President&mdash;`You are only pissing in my pocket because I am dying'. Fred in his autobiography summed up the way he got things done:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fred Hollows was held in very high esteem by his colleagues both here and overseas, he was worshipped by his patients, and he was loved very much by his family and friends.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Opposition senators, I join with the Leader of the Government (Senator Gareth Evans) in expressing our regret at the death, on 10 February, of Professor Fred Hollows at the age of 63. He was an extraordinary Australian. In 1990 he was named Australian of the Year and he was awarded the Australian Human Rights Medal; and in the following year he was named Australian Humanist of the Year and he was awarded the Companion of the Order of Australia. In January 1993 he won the Rotary International Award for Human Understanding for his work in establishing eye surgery programs among Australian Aborigines and in Third World countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Professor Hollows arrived in Sydney in 1965 as an Associate Professor of Ophthalmology at the University of New South Wales and almost immediately attracted prominence. After visiting the Gurindji people of Wattie Creek, he was appalled by the extent of eye disease that he encountered and he observed that of a camp population of 150, all the children had trachoma. Soon after, he helped a group of young Aborigines to establish their own medical service in Redfern, the first of its type in Australia and the prototype of many more around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1975 the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists launched the national trachoma and eye health program and  Professor Hollows took to the outback as head of a mobile medical team. In two years, 105,000 people in 465 locations were examined, 15,000 Aborigines took part in treatment programs and about 1,500 operations were performed. Under his guidance, the program achieved extraordinary success, halving  the incidence of curable blindness among Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was after meeting an Eritrean with an eye condition in his Sydney office that Fred Hollows organised an AIDAB grant for training an Eritrean eye doctor in Sydney. He himself later travelled to the country and conceived the possibility of establishing an artificial lens factory there. In Eritrea and other Third World countries, Fred Hollows introduced preventative medicine and surgical techniques which returned sight to so many people. Building intra-ocular lens factories to combat Third World blindness became the sustaining passion of Professor Hollows in his later years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr President, it was regrettable that Professor Hollows was unable to witness the recent successful Eritrean referendum for independence that you and I had the privilege of witnessing, which brought to an end 30 years of civil war and destruction. This will allow the intra-ocular factory&mdash;which is now being transported by sea from Australia to Eritrea&mdash;soon to start manufacturing in Aymara. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we found extraordinary in Eritrea was the recognition there of Professor Hollows and the incredible benefit that this brought to Australia in terms of attaching credit to our country derived from his work and his reputation in that country. This, to me, was a real reminder of the effect that one individual can have upon the reputation of a country. It was quite an extraordinary experience to go out into villages of Eritrea, which one may have thought very few, if any, Australians had ever visited. When we identified ourselves as Australian, the first comment we heard was about the wonderful work of Fred Hollows. Credit for the good work Fred Hollows had done in so many villages was being accorded to Australia. I found it quite humbling to be part of that experience. It is a great credit to Fred Hollows and to his memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that not only in Eritrea but also in Nepal and in Vietnam Fred Hollows' work in the establishment of intra-ocular factories will be an ongoing legacy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this condolence motion for Fred Hollows. Since 1988 I have had the opportunity to meet Fred on a number of occasions. My first involvement with Fred Hollows was an indirect one when I visited Eritrea as a guest of the ELF in October 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember travelling down through Sudan and finally reaching a place called Rota where there was an underground hospital which was equipped with quite sophisticated medical equipment. We talked to a number of staff there who in the previous months had been trained by Fred Hollows himself on his first visit to Eritrea. The most moving occasion of all was when we met a former patient of Fred Hollows who said that because of Fred's work she had had her sight restored after many years of blindness. I suddenly realised then that this man Hollows was someone exceptional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Hill's remarks that everywhere one went in Eritrea, Fred's fame and service to that country had spread&mdash;so much so that the credit Fred Hollows had established in that country rubbed off on us as Australian visitors. I met Fred when I returned to Australia and, in common with Senator Evans, was overwhelmed by his style, language and presentation. This meant that one was either 110 per cent with Fred or one had better watch out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember one occasion when he came down to visit Parliament House to get the funds for the intra-ocular lens factory in Eritrea. He wandered into my office and shouted out, `Come on, Schacht, let's go round and get hold of Blewett. I need $200,000 for this factory'. I said, `Well, have you got an appointment?'. He replied, `I don't need a bloody appointment&mdash;we will just go to see him and we'll get it off him'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I knew what I was doing, I was leading him around to Dr Blewett's office. We walked in and Neal had quickly got a bureaucrat to come over from AIDAB who was sitting there rather nervously, because he had already heard about Fred's reputation. Fred started the conversation by saying, `Look, Doc, I understand Schacht has got a few numbers for your preselection back in South Australia. Unless you get this money for us, you might be in trouble getting re-elected'. It was the most amazing start to any representation I have ever seen and away Fred went from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conversation lasted about four minutes. Fred's bulldozer effect was very effective because Dr Blewett said, `I am sure we can make arrangements' and the bureaucrat got the message. Then Fred said, `By the way, it is not $200,000 Australian; it is $200,000 American'. So the value had suddenly doubled. Since then the equipment has been prepared and it is on the way. I understand that the Eritreans will name the intra-ocular lens factory after Fred Hollows; it will be called the Fred Hollows Factory. In Eritrea there will always be a very effective reminder of the contribution made by Fred Hollows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions since then, I have had opportunities to meet Fred at functions. I was given the great honour at an AIDAB conference to introduce Fred as the guest speaker. The first 10 minutes of Fred's speech related to his version of Marxism and the evils of the capitalist system, which startled most of the audience. He then proffered a few views on how AIDS could be controlled in Australia, and that upset the rest of the audience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the people at the conference had come along to meet this fantastic character, Fred. By the end of his speech they were rather confused about the range of issues that Fred got himself involved in and how he expressed his views. But when they met him afterwards privately in conversation, despite, as Senator Evans said, his `rough as guts' attitude, they saw some great charm about Fred such that, in the end, one could not help but be on his side. I have never yet come across a person who had some meeting or some period of time with Fred who was not, in the end, an absolute devotee of his cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is great sadness with Fred's passing. The cause of his death, cancer, caused a slow deterioration in Fred. But throughout it all, even when he was greatly affected, he was still working flat out for the causes, still performing his work as a doctor, still making phone calls, still getting people to make the commitment to raise the money for the causes in which he so strongly believed. The state funeral that was conducted at the cathedral in Sydney was one of the most moving occasions at which I have been present in my period in public life in Australia. So many people from all walks of life attended and the orations from various people about Fred's career were very moving, from that given by the Catholic Bishop of Sydney to that given by the well-known communist Frank Hardy. They all made it clear that, obviously, Fred was a remarkable person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will certainly miss conversations with Fred&mdash;or arguments, I should say, because conservations with Fred usually were arguments. All I want to say in conclusion is that not only was Fred Hollows a great Australian&mdash;in my period in public life, I cannot think of a greater Australian I have met&mdash;but also he was a great human being worldwide. By any measure, Australia has been very fortunate to have had Fred Hollows as an Australian citizen. He brought great credit to our country right around the world.

He was probably best known for his work with Aboriginal eye disease, working on a national trachoma program under which 100,000 Aborigines were treated in the first two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He established eye clinics in Australia, Bangladesh, Burma, Latin America, Vietnam, Africa, Nepal and in other countries which Senator Evans has already mentioned. He was heavily involved in building intra-ocular lens factories to combat Third World blindness. He projected his image around the world. That has already been alluded to by others who have spoken on this condolence motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As described by Bishop John Heaps during the funeral service, `Fred Hollows did not treat eyes. He cared for human beings'. He was different from other medical missionaries. He was able to inspire those around him, to instil in them the same sense of dynamic enthusiasm he had for the work he was doing. He was an exceptional man; simple, gruff, possibly some would consider rough&mdash;and I think that has been exemplified by what Senator Schacht said of his knowledge of Professor Hollows. These attributes endeared him to so many, and enabled him to relate to those with whom he worked. I met him only once, but the impact of that meeting was immense. He had compassion reaching far beyond that of most of us. He had, with his whole being, no more important a goal in life than to help, no matter what the personal sacrifice. I understand his energy was limitless and we would do well ourselves to think about how Fred Hollows channelled his energies. His selflessness was remarkable. He was a man who gave back to life far more than he took from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After being diagnosed as having cancer in 1989, Fred Hollows continued tirelessly with his work, although he was forced to slow down due to radiotherapy. This alone reflects the selflessness and altruism of the man. He showed much courage in making the conscious decision to not let his illness interfere with his work. It is unfortunate that it was acknowledgment of the traumas in his life that instigated recognition of the outstanding work he was doing. I also mention&mdash;as Senator Schacht has mentioned&mdash;the point that Professor Hollows made about the AIDS debate. I commend him for entering that debate and saying, as an eminent professor, what should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I extend to his wife, Gabi Hollows, and family&mdash;through whom, together with the Hollows Foundation his outstanding work will be continued&mdash;our sympathy. Gabi Hollows has the same sense of dedication and drive for not only helping but also teaching the underprivileged people. She should be commended and acknowledged for her past and continuing role with the Hollows Foundation. The National Party joins with the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Evans) in supporting the condolence motion on the passing of Professor Fred Hollows, a great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of all Australian Democrat senators, I support the condolence motion for Professor Fred Hollows. Fred Hollows was a truly great Australian. He was a great Australian eye surgeon, a great Australian humanitarian and a great Australian character, as has been said by everyone today. Millions of Australians, especially our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, millions of Africans and millions of South-East Asians will all remember Fred with gratefulness and much affection, and so do I. He used his illness to support his work, and that was a very brave thing to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Fred when I was seated next to him at a quiz night. He came dressed in very casual clothes and his wife, Gabi, was dressed in beautiful and stunning clothes. They looked completely different from each other and I think that was pretty indicative of the way they both were. I would like to give our love to Gabi and to the family. This is a terribly sad loss for them&mdash;the loss of a father and of a husband&mdash;but they are carrying on, as far as I can see, very bravely and very well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I had the privilege of knowing Fred Hollows for some time. Late last year I hosted a dinner for him in my suite in Parliament House. It was attended by people from both sides of the Parliament. We talked about the work of the Hollows Foundation and how we might keep it going. It was quite obvious that Fred's health was in decline at that stage, but I have to say he was in good form that night. As Senator Hill said, recently he and I were in Eritrea, and Fred Hollows is a legend in that country. I am glad to say that the intra-ocular lens factory will continue his work. It will be operating in Eritrea later this year and it will be named after him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In accordance with Commonwealth Government Policy, the Corporation makes payments in lieu of rates to local authorities in respect of staff houses, property leased to tenants other than the Commonwealth and terminal buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation has a policy of fully recovering from its tenants the amounts paid to local authorities in lieu of rates. This recovery is either through direct billings of tenants, included in gross rents for concessionaires, or on a net rent and outgoings basis for all other areas of multi-tenanted buildings.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Authority issued a permit to Magnetic Keys Ltd on 28 October 1988. The Deed of Agreement between the Authority and Magnetic Keys Ltd was finalised in March 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The documentation for the first hearing of the AAT was prepared in May 1989, and included the material pertinent to the Authority's decision to issue the permit to Magnetic Keys up to early April 1989. The Deed was not included with this documentation as it did not relate  to the sequence of events leading the Authority to make the original decision to issue a permit (rather, it was a consequence of that decision).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deed was included in the material prepared for the second hearing of the AAT appeal in March 1990 on the basis that it, and other documents, helped show the progress of events during the period between April 1989 and March 1990 hearings; the material in the second list was not tabled as Island Voice withdrew the appeal (on 5 March 1990) prior to the hearing commencing (set for 19 March 1990).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Authority does not claim that the breakwalls cannot be removed. It was and is still the Authority's view that once the walls were completed, removal would cause greater environmental impact than leaving them in place. This was stated in the notice printed in the Gazette (No. S390) dated 15 December 1988 giving the reasons for the Authority's decision to grant a permit for the development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kinsey's affidavit of 21 August 1989 contains reference to the possibility of the removal of only the thin sheet piling used in the construction of the walls&mdash;not the completed breakwalls themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 August 1989 (not 29 August 1989) Judge Bulley lifted a temporary Stay of Works that he had imposed on the project on 16 August 1989. The Authority undertook to inform the AAT when work at the site would cause irreversible changes to the Marine Park and did so in February 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is not true to say that removal of the breakwalls was never a requirement. The intent of the provisions in the Deed was to ensure that the capacity existed to remove partially completed walls if necessary&mdash;for instance if they were unstable and unsafe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Not applicable (see (3) above).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) and (6) In the notice published in the Gazette (No.S390) dated 15 December 1988 giving the reasons for the Authority's decision to grant a permit for the development, it was stated that it was the Authority's view that the removal of the breakwalls would not be considered feasible (ie. would be impracticable) once the walls were completed because it would involve risk of unacceptable environmental damage to the Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The October 1988 assessment report on the Magnetic Quays development stated that the walls should be considered permanent facilities. Subsequent discussions between the Authority and the Australian Construction Services on whether physically removing all traces of the completed breakwalls was possible, concluded that such large-scale works would inevitably lead to significant silt production in the rest of Nelly Bay and the release of sulphides and rust into the Marine Park from the remnants of the sheet piling at the centre of the walls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Authority has had extensive experience with the environmental assessment of other large scale developments in the Marine Park eg. Hamilton Island runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No. Attempting to rehabilitate or restore the Magnetic Quays site would damage the Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The Authority received expert advice on the application of the insurance policy from Sedgwick James Ltd, Australia's largest insurance brokers on the same day that the policy was queried by Mr Woodley. This advice was accepted by the Authority as indicating that the insurance would answer the matters raised in Mr Woodley's query.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GBRMPA was not threatened by any party during this time or at any other time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) I am not satisfied that there was at any stage a decision to "approve the project without adequate insurance".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The GBRMPA received legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) on application of a Stay Order on 7 and 8 August 1989. The AGS advised that it would be a legitimate stance for the Authority not to apply for a Stay Order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of this advice, the Authority Chairman, with the support of other Authority members, decided not to apply for a Stay Order at that time, because no works which might cause irreversible damage to the Marine Park were imminent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The GBRMPA Chairman did not convince the developer to press ahead after the Authority had decided against the proposed development. The developer had been working to meet the Authority's requirements for several years, and the remaining problems identified by the Authority at its meeting of 24 October 1988, were of a technical nature for which the Authority believed the developer would be able to find satisfactory solutions. The Authority's view was conveyed to the developer by the Chairman as part of his proper duties.</PARA>

However, in mid 1990 the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics (BMR) was requested to prepare a financial evaluation report on the leases now held by Pivot Mining Pty Ltd, which cover only a small portion of the Shoalwater Bay area. This evaluation concluded that there is a `98 per cent probability that the project would show a zero or less rate of return'. The analysis was based only on data set out in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) submitted by Pivot and estimates made by the BMR. Its conclusions take no account of the potential for discovery of further heavy mineral deposits, either within the area of the  leases or elsewhere in the Shoalwater Bay area.</PARA>
