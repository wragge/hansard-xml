<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I ask the minister whether in his judgment it is right and proper that a decision on foreign ownership of a substantial proportion of the press in this country be dependent on a political leader's arbitrary interpretation of balanced reporting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The circumstances under which the decision was made to increase the shareholding in Fairfax in question have been fully explained in this place and elsewhere. It was not based on any question about the content of editorial comment or anything else. It was a decision based on the financial and economic management needs of the organisation which were perceived to be such as to justify an increase to protect the interests of the shareholder and, as a result, to protect the interests that everyone had in that investment in new technology being preserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of a balance, and the discussion associated with that, was wholly subsidiary and on the side in terms of its relevance to the circumstances of the particular matter. That was perfectly clear from the passages that I read into the record yesterday. I should also perhaps read into the record some relevant excerpts that I did not have with me yesterday but which are very clear in their content. They are excerpts from the interview with Mr Conrad Black on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> on Friday, 19 November. When asked to describe the nature of the deal in question, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There wasn't a deal.</PARA>
<PARA>In the context of a similar discussion that he said he had had with Dr Hewson, Mr Black went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only interest either man ever expressed was that the paper's quality be maintained and that professionalism be maintained, and where one or other of them perceived it had been lacking before, to be shored up. There was no discussion of deals and no discussion of partisanship.</PARA>
<PARA>In that same transcript, when the journalist asked a question about the inference being drawn by the opposition about these references to balance, Mr Black said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, you can tell the Opposition that what Mr Keating said was virtually identical to what Dr Hewson said and they both behaved with the most complete probity.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is from the horse's mouth on this particular issue. There was obviously some discussion between Mr Black and Mr Keating on the virtues of balance and responsible media. There was equally obviously some discussion with Dr Hewson on exactly the same subject. There was no question of conditionality in either case and, accordingly, no basis for this line of questioning which the opposition continues futilely to pursue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister seems to have moved a long way away from what the Prime Minister said the other day which was, in fact, that permission to increase would be dependent on his assessment of balanced reporting of that particular media outlet. On the basis of what the Prime Minister said was important, I ask the minister: how does he interpret the meaning of balanced journalism?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to get into that sort of area other than to say that, in the context of this particular exchange, the interpretation that was clearly adopted by Mr Black and what Mr Keating said was that the media in question simply be responsible. It does not mean that support can never be expressed for one side of politics or the other. In fact, clearly support was expressed for one side of politics in the last election&mdash;and it was not our side of politics, notwithstanding all the hares that those opposite are trying to set running in this particular respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter simply of an approach to journalism which is responsible, which has regard to facts, which does not mix comment and facts in a way that is manifestly unacceptable. Clearly, Mr Keating was expressing views of that kind. That is the view that Mr Black understood him to be expressing and, moreover, for present purposes it is not a view that was different in any significant way from the view that Dr Hewson was expressing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important package of legislation and it represents a major advance in the protection of superannuation savings. It has received a lot of support, not surprisingly, because of the comprehensive nature of the committee's review. It is designed to make trustees more accountable and responsive to their fund members, to enhance the scope for members to participate in the management of their funds and to ensure that the ISC has appropriate and effective enforcement powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important part of Senator Chris Evans's question is: what transitional arrangements do fund managers need to consider between now and the impact of the legislation? The legislation will apply to those schemes from the commencement of the 1994 income year. So it will not be the same date for all but, of course, for most it will be 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some points about what it is that those fund managers should be doing. During the period of up to seven months&mdash;maybe more for some, but certainly the seven months before July 1994&mdash;they really should be looking at getting their affairs in order in relation to this legislation. The government has now provided a very clear statement of the supervision and prudential requirements well in advance. A large number of funds will also need to initiate changes to their trust deeds and other supporting documentation to comply with the legislative provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge those fund managers to consider these changes and not leave them until the last minute. They have been expressing concern that perhaps it was not clear what the government wanted from them. It now is, and I hope they will use this time to make those changes so that the trustees are more accountable, that the members have the greater role and that superannuation is used for genuine retirement purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very worthwhile package of measures. I think it will enhance the retirement income policy for all Australians. I thank once again the committee for its support; I thank Senator Chris Evans for raising this issue; and I urge fund managers to take the opportunity of this period before the legislation comes into effect to make sure their arrangements meet the proper requirements so that we can have a smooth transition to the new regime.</PARA>

<TITLE>Media: Prime Minister's Remarks</TITLE>
<QUESTION PAGE="3405" SPEAKER="Knowles Sen S.C." NAMEID="TH4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I remind the minister of remarks made to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> press gallery journalist by the Prime Minister when the journalist claimed that Mr Keating had been brought to heel by state premiers as a result of a special Loan Council and COAG meeting. Mr Keating is reported to have said to the reporter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are a disgrace. You, your newspaper and your editor are corrupt. You're finished and you'll never get anything else out of us.</PARA>
<PARA>That was reported on 13 December 1992. Does the minister agree that untempered remarks such as these indicate that the Prime Minister's sense of balanced journalism only exists when stories reflecting positively on him are written and that negative or less than flattering press is considered biased?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3405" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that follows at all. All of us on occasion can get a little testy with journalists when they behave in a fashion which lets their profession down, which demonstrates their lack of professionalism, particularly when they come from a newspaper like the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, which is absolutely notorious for its inability to report, let alone report fairly and prominently, views that differ from its own. It is a difficult paper to live with at the best of times and it is not surprising that on occasion there would be some expression of concern of that kind expressed in appropriate terms by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, all this notion that this bears upon in some way the attitude that was taken by the Prime Minister and the government towards the shareholding issue in the present case is simply unfounded. In answer to a question of a similar kind from a journalist, Mr Black said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You're being too suspicious, you see. You're imputing questionable motives to your Prime Minister. All he was seeking was professionalism, fairness and balance in the Fairfax titles and all I was pledging to do was my best to ensure that that occurred, but that contained no implications of partisanship in one direction or another, and indeed I had somewhat similar discussions with Dr Hewson.</PARA>
<PARA>So I think those opposite should get very clear in their own minds exactly what their own bloke was saying to Mr Black before they pursue these discussions any further. If he was saying no more than what Mr Keating was saying about the appropriateness of a sense of decency and professionalism in the way a paper is run, he was simply contributing to the public interest and not in any way undermining it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Does the Australian Bureau of Statistics study entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian families</EMPHASIS>, a publication released today, form part of the Australian government's commitment to the International Year of the Family? Does this survey debunk the myth of the decline of the Australian family? What does this survey tell us about the changing nature of Australian families?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3406" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I launched the results of a 1992 survey of the Australian family, done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The publication released today, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian families</EMPHASIS>, is one of a number of publications that will come from that very comprehensive survey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report presents very important findings about how Australian families are constituted and how their members care for each other. It gives us a good idea of who in Australia is living with whom and how they support and care for each other. We now have detailed information about ways in which family members support each other in areas such as employment, income, housing, child care, personal care, education and even transport. The survey should lay to rest the insidious message being promoted by some on the other side that people are turning away from their families, that people do not care for their families, and even that the family is collapsing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What the survey clearly proves is that, although families in Australia are changing their shape and the way they are constituted, in the main they are going strong. This government recognises families in all their diversity, and so does this survey&mdash;it is just what the statistics show. To quote from one of the statements released today with the publication by the ABS, the results of the survey show:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that family members draw on help from both their immediate and extended family in a variety of areas . . . such help is the central focus of an individual's support network.</PARA>
<PARA>Nine out of 10 people still live with at least one other family member. Of these people, the family unit of a married couple with dependent children is still the most common family type, at 43 per cent. One-parent families constitute up to 13 per cent. Of those one-parent families, 84 per cent are headed by a woman. Four per cent are step or blended families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this report shows, in the main the members of Australian families are very committed to each other. This report shows very clearly that, if things go wrong, the first port of call, the first person somebody turns to, is a family member. So I would like to ask why Dr Hewson allows John Bradford and 30 or 40 of his coalition cohorts who are members of the Lyons Forum to continue to bag the Australian family. Why does Dr Hewson's lot have the right to say that one sort of support of a loving family is better than another? I wish they would explain that. Indeed, I believe Dr Hewson should show a bit of leadership for a change and tell that forum to let Australian families get on with the business at hand&mdash;that is, caring and sharing with each other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the statistics do provide invaluable assistance to our understanding of the contemporary issues facing Australian families. These statistics of Australian families will very much debunk the myths circulating about families. They will be very useful in assisting government with policy making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we do not tailor government support for families to some myth about families as though they were constituted in the 1960s. We need to tailor policies to families based on the data we have about families in the 1990s. I think it is very important to note, too, that this survey was conducted last year as part of the government's contribution to IYF, the International Year of the Family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More reports will arise from this material as it comes to hand, particularly focusing on families as providing carers and also on the important connection between workers with family responsibilities. Both of those are hinted at in this report. There is some evidence in the report, and further detailed information will be forthcoming with further surveys. I believe the ABS should be congratulated on its very useful data, which will assist government and, indeed, help debunk myths about the family.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think a remark about the response of the European Community, or the European Union, to these trade issues of the kind that was made by the Prime Minister is going to even be noticed in Europe, let alone treated by the Europeans with the kind of response that would in some way undermine the likely endgame of the Uruguay Round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Europeans are used to very robust exchanges of this kind. Their own response to some of the key policy issues in the round has been less than forthcoming. They deserve to be stirred up on occasions. If the mere existence of APEC will have some incidental impact in making them rethink their role and status in the world and undermine some of the perhaps excessive confidence which existed in the past about their capacity to influence the rest of the world in ways to their own liking, but to nobody else's, so much the better. I do not think any question arises about those remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the remarks made about Dr Mahathir, I believe that Dr Mahathir will very well understand the context in which those remarks were made. After all, Dr Mahathir has not himself shirked from making the occasional quite vigorous statement. Indeed, in the particular quotation put to Mr Keating which prompted his remarks there was one such rather vigorous statement. The truth of the matter is that, when provoked, as Mr Keating was on this occasion by a whole series of media inquiries, media interrogation, of the kind he faced in this instance, it is understandable that a remark of that kind might have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disappointing that Dr Mahathir chose not to attend the APEC leaders conference, but he obviously had his own reasons for doing so and I do not think we ought to overplay the significance of either his attendance or his non-attendance on the one hand or of any remarks made by Mr Keating or anyone else about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, those remarks should not be allowed, as they have been rather by the Australian press, with its usual flair on these occasions, to undermine the significance of what has been a supremely important occasion so far as the history of this region is concerned and so far as the likely future of world trade is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would make, in fairness to Malaysia's role in APEC, is that we should never underestimate or undervalue the contribution Malaysia has in fact been making over the last four years to the success of the APEC process. It may be the case that it was not at this particular leaders meeting, but it has attended committees, working groups and all of the ministerial meetings, and it has made a splendidly constructive contribution all along the way in so doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think all of these things should be seen in their appropriate context and certainly I would not envisage any long-term consequences&mdash;in fact, with a bit of luck, any consequences at all&mdash;to flow from this particular, rather vigorous, exchange in a context that will be well understood on both sides.</PARA>

Will the Australian government make further representations to the Papua New Guinea government urging access to Bougainville for humanitarian agencies?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3411" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the report, although I have not yet had the opportunity to study it in detail. The Australian government shares Amnesty's concern at reports of continuing human rights violations on Bougainville, both on the part of PNG security forces and the Bougainville rebels. That said, it has to be acknowledged that the situation there is a very complex one and it is very difficult to obtain unbiased accounts of incidents involving claims of human rights abuse. For that reason the government welcomes the statement that was made on the weekend by defence minister Tohian that the PNG government will fully address the Amnesty report and its recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the inference that the Amnesty allegations have damaged Australian government credibility on human rights in the region. Our commitment to upholding human rights is absolutely universal in its application. We have regularly raised our concerns about possible human rights abuses on Bougainville with the PNG government, emphasising the need for appropriate disciplinary or legal action to be taken against offenders from whatever side, and specifically urging the government to seek a political solution rather than a military one to the conflict on Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy in the human rights field is well known internationally. It has been well stated recently by the Prime Minister. We simply will not compromise on questions of democracy, our commitment to human rights or in our respect for human values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question about reviewing our relationship with Papua New Guinea, we have long recognised that, to be influential in achieving human rights objectives, we need to be aware of the totality of issues which make up any particular bilateral relationship. In this regard&mdash;as I and the Prime Minister have said on other occasions&mdash;we seek to handle human rights issues consistently but sensitively, only in very exceptional circumstances doing anything other than relying on quiet persuasion. Punitive or other sanctions can be relevant on occasions, but we do not see them as being relevant here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion contained in the Amnesty report that we consider suspending military aid to Papua New Guinea in the circumstances of the Bougainville situation is simply not a constructive one. Australian defence assistance to PNG is aimed at developing that country's defence force capabilities across the range of its constitutionally defined functions, which include national security protection, fisheries surveillance, search and rescue, support for internal security and aid to the civil power. Our defence assistance also extends to supervision of civil engineering tasks in two provinces and communications assistance to PNG police. It perhaps ought to be stated again, because it seems to be constantly misunderstood, that we are providing no direct operational assistance to PNG security forces on Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne's question on the human rights manual was an interesting one; I am sure Defence will be interested in it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to further representations about humanitarian agencies' access to Bougainville, the government, both publicly and privately, has been urging the PNG government to give humanitarian agencies access to Bougainville. Indeed, it was as a result of an initiative taken by us in 1990 that the first international NGOs were allowed access to Bougainville the following year. All of these issues will be raised during the forthcoming Australia-Papua New Guinea ministerial forum, which is being held in Mount Hagen in about nine or 10 days time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I refer to media reports of a 50-year-old woman, recently widowed after 33 years of marriage, who nursed her mother, father-in-law and husband through their terminal illnesses and has four children and 11 grandchildren, and who has now been forced out into the long job queues without any choice in the matter. Why was the decision to abolish the widow's B pension not phased in? What consideration was given to continuing the widow's pension for such widows in the likely event of their long absence from the paid work force? What cost-benefit analysis has been done of the returns from retraining 50-year-old widows for employment, as opposed to training unemployed younger people, taking into account the different expected length of work force participation? How many widows who would formerly have qualified for a widow's pension are represented in the unemployment figure? Finally, will the government recognise the rights of these widows and give consideration to restoring the widow's B pension to them so that they can have a choice of widow status or labour market traineeships?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The widow's B pension is being phased out over a period of 15 years which began in July 1987, so there is a phasing out period. Since July 1987, no new grants have been made to widows aged under 45 who receive the sole parent's pension and some others under 50 years of age. So the widow's B pension will cease to be paid early next century when all women who have qualified since 1987 attain age pension age and residency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the simplification of the superannuation package, the Treasurer announced new arrangements regarding the preservation age. From 1 July 1992, the preservation age became 55 for people born before July 1960, 56 for people born from 1960 to June 1961, 57 for people born between 1961 and 1962, 58 for the next year, et cetera, so that for those born after June 1964 the preservation age is 60. New arrangements replaced the standard preservation age of 55 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriate consideration was given to preserving the widow's B pension for younger women but it was decided that younger women whose work force opportunities were not restricted by caring responsibilities should be expected and encouraged to re-enter the labour force rather than become dependent on the welfare system. The phasing out of the widow's B pension from 1987 was well publicised and families were permitted to make any preparations they decided were necessary. It is not the role of government to promote the life insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A cost benefit analysis of the sort proposed has not been undertaken. The Department of Social Security is intending to evaluate the changes to the widow's B pension as part of its portfolio evaluation plan strategy in 1996. Re-training for those suffering particular work force disadvantage&mdash;such as women who have been out of the work force for long periods&mdash;remains, of course, a government priority. It is not clear what costs and benefits this question refers to. It should be noted that the government does provide considerable assistance to people providing care for sick or elderly relatives through carer's pensions in the social security system and tax rebates in the taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the official answer and I will editorialise briefly at the end of it. Regarding this particular case, because women are so young at 50 it is logical that that age bracket was the one most targeted to do away with the widow's B pension. Not all women who reach the age of 50 are going to be in a situation of having 33 years of marriage, four children and 11 grandchildren. As a result of Senator Harradine's question I will approach the Minister for Social Security, Mr Baldwin, to see whether we can get any flexibility in the rules. I do not believe it is a good idea to simply encourage all those who are widowed to go onto social security. Encouragement to go into the work force and the provision of training courses are welcomed by many and I think that should be encouraged, but this case does show up to me, at least, the need for some flexibility and I am going to ask Mr Baldwin whether that can be provided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the government undertaken or will the government undertake an assessment of the risk to northern Australia of fallout from a major nuclear accident in Java?  What is the government's current assessment of the safety risk to the Australian public arising out of the Indonesian nuclear power program? Given the proposed nuclear science and technology cooperation agreement between Australia and Indonesia does not rule out Australia's involvement in the development of Indonesia's nuclear power program, what plans does the government have to fully inform Australia's citizens of the implications of that proposed agreement before it is signed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can take those questions in reverse order. The Senate will be aware from a number of previous statements I have made that information about that agreement has been on the public record since 1991. Discussions on its conclusion are still taking place with Indonesia. There is no hidden agenda about that. The object of the draft agreement is to enhance Australia's existing and mutually beneficial nuclear science and technology cooperation with Indonesia in areas such as nuclear medicine, radiation protection, nuclear related safety information and applications of isotopes. As Senator Margetts should be aware, that agreement will be made public on signature in the course of normal procedures and subsequently tabled in parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the risk question, as I have said before&mdash;and it is true that I have been asked questions about this before&mdash;I do not see that the alleged risks from a well-regulated nuclear power program using the latest western technology, as planned by Indonesia apparently, will be severe or as substantial as claimed. The Indonesian government has not yet made a decision on the type of reactor to be chosen for its program. The reactor designs it is considering, however, are all western water cooled reactors incorporating the latest technology and advanced safety systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also like to point out that it is completely misleading to draw erroneous comparisons with Chernobyl. Any reference to a potential Chernobyl-type accident is valid only for nuclear power plants with that particular Soviet type reactor, known as an RBMK type reactor&mdash;a design built only in the former USSR, which in 1989 decided in any event not to construct any more reactors of this type. Indonesia is not contemplating using a Soviet designed or built power reactor to meet its energy needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Chernobyl disaster, quite extensive examinations of its causes and consequences carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency and the relevant committees of the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD found that the basic failure was due to the RBMK reactor which, due to a fundamental weakness in its design, could be very unstable under certain operating conditions. According to the 1993 report of the UN scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation, Chernobyl is the only accident that has occurred in a civilian nuclear powered installation that has resulted in radiation doses to members of the public greater than those resulting from exposure in one year due to natural sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other major nuclear power reactor accident which has occurred during the accumulated 6,500 years of commercial nuclear power reactor operation&mdash;namely, that at Three Mile Island&mdash;had completely different radiological consequences to Chernobyl. That reactor, like all western reactors and unlike that at Chernobyl, was housed in a containment building. The Three Mile Island accident released a large portion of the core inventory of fission products. But most of those fission products were retained within the containment system and, as a result, the accident had minimal public health consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will finally say this: Indonesia's first power reactors are not due to come into operation until 2003 at the earliest. Needless to say, the Australian government will be engaging in close dialogue with the Indonesian authorities, which have been quite open about their nuclear power program as their plans evolve, making clear any concerns that we may have as that program does evolve. We will certainly be maintaining our very close interest in the development of that Indonesian nuclear power program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have addressed the question before about the impact of the particular geology of Indonesia on the power reactors concerned. I have made the point that, on all available evidence, modern engineering techniques are amply equipped to cope with any stresses associated with building in zones of that kind, as indeed has been demonstrated in Japan, which is located in a classic earthquake zone. I do not see the occasion being likely to arise for an inquiry of the kind that Senator Margetts has spoken about. Of course, we will continue to closely observe developments in this matter. Our overriding concern will always be for the safety of the Australian people. At this stage, for all the reasons that I have spelt out, there is no reason to believe that any such inquiry would be remotely necessary or would be likely to achieve any useful purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is another question; me sometimes. There is a significant difference in the two figures that Senator Campbell has quoted. Of course, I can only pick up the distinction in the way that he expresses the phrases because I have to confess&mdash;and the honourable senator may be shocked to know&mdash;that I do not remember the detail of the answer I gave to him in August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinction, as I understand it, is between staff in the department who work in an office environment and those who work, for example, on building sites and otherwise and, therefore, were not part of the question Senator Campbell asked about those within offices. That was a question directed to utilisation of office space, as I recall the question, although it was asked several months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was in one instance an indication of a staff number that only referred to those who were orthodox, described, I suppose, as clerical, and other workers who work in the department in non-clerical occupations and would not therefore be involved in a review as it relates to office space. As I recall it, that is the distinction. But the first question goes back several months, so I am operating only from my memory with regard to that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the numbers in the department have declined very significantly since 1987. It has been a very well managed change by the department. Managing staff reduction is never an easy thing to do, but employment in the department continues in those areas that are subject to competition where the government has adopted the policy of opening businesses operating within the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services to private sector competition. It has led to pressure on employment in some of those areas with jobs moving, for example, to private sector competitors. It has led to increased efficiency and an improved bottom line return for the taxpayer&mdash;in fact, those businesses collectively, far from being a call on the taxpayers, have made a small profit in the last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall it&mdash;I have not counted the number of people in the department in the last day or two&mdash;that 8,760 figure looks like the accurate figure overall. There has been a significant decline, and I think that explains the difference. But, as I say, the question goes back to August, so I do not remember the detail as precisely as I otherwise might.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I seek from the minister an explanation for the difference. I think the logic he has applied is to say that there has actually been a decrease because he has taken out the tradespeople and so forth, as he explained in his answer yesterday. But in fact there has been an increase of 1,800 people since the August answer. What I want to know is: how did that increase occur and where are they? He has specifically told me that he has taken out people who work in workshops, laboratories, repositories, storage facilities and so forth. He keeps telling us, `We've decreased the number of people in employment', but the discrepancy between the August answer and yesterday's answer actually shows that the staff numbers have gone up by 1,800&mdash;which is one hell of a lot of people. Part of the explanation I think that he was trying to give in yesterday's answer is that there has been the inclusion of what he describes as `longer-term temporary staff'. What I would really like to know is how many longer-term temporary staff are employed. There seems to be an enormous difference there, and I would like to know what that is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Wednesday, 17 November, Senator Tierney asked me a question in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training relating to the reduction in the number of university places by 1996. The minister has provided me with some information which I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The information read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The claim that the government will reduce funding to the higher education sector and that the number of new student places will be `savagely' cut in 1996 is completely erroneous. In 1996, due to the effect of earlier government decisions and the new places just announced, there will be an additional 5,000 places in the higher education sector over the number funded in 1995. Furthermore Commonwealth funding for university places will continue to rise until 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The higher education sector has experienced a massive expansion since 1988 and the sector is still growing. Further growth already agreed to for 1994 and 1995, with the new places recently announced, will bring the total number of new places created for Australian students over the decade, from 1989 to 1998 to over 100,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent announcement of 1,500 places in 1996 is for new places. When the Commonwealth creates new places, it has to fund additional places not only in the first year, but also in the second and subsequent years. So for every 1,000 new places, there will be in the order of 2,750 places funded in the system four years later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's provision of the additional 1,500 new places for 1996 is particularly significant given the present budgetary climate and clearly demonstrates the government's commitment to some growth in opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government does not accept that it is the government's responsibility to meet all so called "unmet demand" for higher education places nor is it realistic for all year 12 school leavers to aspire to enter a university. The government is mindful of the need to build up Australia's less developed vocational education and training sector and to ensure that this sector is also valued by a larger proportion of school leavers.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IWTO funding offer was first made at the IWTO conference at Istanbul in May 1993. Senator McDonald rightly recognises that it has been Minister Crean who has actively sought to engage the IWTO and to bring their offer to fruition whilst others have simply chosen to write the offer off as a myth and not even try.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point needs to be made very clearly that it is essentially up to producers and processors, not the Government, to come to some compromise on the means of raising the money so all who benefit from wool promotion make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, to assist the Australian industry in its efforts to secure the IWTO funding of wool promotion, the Minister has discussed the issue extensively during his recent meetings with representatives of major processing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there is a continuing preparedness on the part of many processors to make a contribution to wool promotion, the difficulty is to find an acceptable mechanism to collect the funds and meet their concern that their competitors are also paying. On this basis the IWTO has asserted that the only effective way to do so is to impose a levy at the point of export.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's concern is that an export tax has the potential to simply fall back onto the grower, and if the whole point of this exercise is to broaden the funding base then the issue needs to be thoroughly examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has encouraged the Australian industry, the IWS, and the IWTO to get together and examine all the options. This process is continuing and the President of the IWTO, Mr Grunzke, and a number of IWTO national committee representatives will meet with Australian producers in Melbourne in December to consider all the options for securing an IWTO contribution to promotion funding, including the IWTO export tax proposal.</PARA>

<PARA>I am sure we all enjoyed hearing Senator Schacht read out letters written by our colleagues in support of one of the particular grants, but I point out to the Senate that, in fact, he was not fully dealing with the matter raised in the other place yesterday by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and would like to refer to some of the things that he said; there is not time to refer to all of it. The honourable member for Wide Bay started by dealing with the number of Australians unemployed and things of that nature. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the audit report reveals damning statistics:  ALP electorates, on average, $257,000; coalition electorates, on average, $141,000; marginal ALP electorates, $326,000; marginal coalition seats, $163,000.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is even worse, 73 per cent of all of the grants went to Labor electorates even though they amounted to only 53 per cent of the seats.</PARA>
<PARA>In dealing with the issue more widely, he referred to various grants which were made in the electorates of Hinkler, Kennedy and Dawson, including the one in Dawson to the Brothers Rugby League Club in Mackay. There is no reason to think that that was not an application that should not have been supported by those whose letters he read out today. To suggest otherwise is quite absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point the honourable member for Wide Bay was making in relation to allocating grants was about the disproportionate amounts that went into these various electorates, and in particular into the electorate of Wide Bay. The honourable member for Wide Bay went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me tell the House that I have a degree of personal interest in this.</PARA>
<PARA>And, of course, he did. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The poorest electorate in Australia&mdash;the electorate with the biggest number of people earning less than $16,000 a year; the electorate with the least number of people earning more than $60,000 a year&mdash;is my electorate of Wide Bay. I am sad to say that it is the poorest electorate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Then he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did we get the biggest amount of grants?</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to assert again that his electorate received $65,808, whereas, I remind you, Mr President, the marginal ALP electorates were given $326,000. The point of the discussion that took place in the other place yesterday was the disproportionate amount of money that was allocated&mdash;$150,000 to that club in the seat of Dawson, $340,000 into the electorate of Hinkler, and $65,808 into the electorate of Wide Bay. That is the point that we are making.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht stands up here today and reads out letters and thinks he is scoring a point because they happen to be coalition senators supporting that other club in Mackay, but he completely misses the point that so little money went, in total, into the electorate of Wide Bay. The honourable member for Wide Bay dealt with who got which money in that electorate. Nearing the end of the speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My electorate of Wide Bay also, sadly, boasts one of the highest unemployment rates in Australia. What did it get? It received $65,000. That is only half the coalition average and only one-fifth of what was available to Labor Party members defending marginal seats.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are talking about. What sort of criteria enabled this vast difference to occur between grants which went to marginal Labor electorates, marginal coalition electorates, ALP electorates and coalition electorates? What criteria could possibly have been used to then determine that the electorate of Wide Bay, the poorest electorate in Australia, should have received only $65,808 out of these sports grants? It could only be that it was an electorate the Labor Party did not expect to win&mdash;an electorate with the highest unemployment rates in Australia; an electorate least able to raise money and whose people were not able to raise it themselves. </PARA>

The only reason it was revealed was that, Mr Truss, one of the opposition's own members of parliament in the lower house, got up in the House of Representatives yesterday and drew attention to this particular grant. It was not done in the way Senator Reid indicated. He actually specifically complained about it being a political grant. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some other very significant grants. I was interested to note the grant that went to the Brothers rugby league club in Mackay. It was the third largest grant in Queensland. This is a club that has a very close association with the minister for primary industries in Queensland, that diabolical failure of a minister, Mr Ed Casey. This club has poker machines. It is generally regarded as being quite financially affluent, and it received $150,000. Of even more interest, the president of this club, which boasts amongst its membership Ed Casey, the Queensland Labor minister for primary industries, happens also to have been the ALP campaign director for the seat of Dawson at the last federal election. So the campaign director of the marginal electorate of Dawson managed to get something for an organisation that could be counted upon to do the right thing by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Truss said. It is a straight political criticism of this club. He accused this club of politically supporting the Labor Party. When, in response to this outrageous accusation against the Brothers rugby club of Mackay that it could be counted upon to do the right thing by Labor, we produce letters saying that the opposition supported the Brothers rugby club of Mackay in fulsome and enthusiastic terms, the opposition starts squealing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Truss had not raised this yesterday when he thought he was being politically smart in the House of Representatives, we would not have gone and checked the background of this particular application.

I ask the Senate to compare that to the Liberal-held electorate of Wakefield, which got four grants totalling $92,000, or the electorate of Barker, which got five grants totalling $116,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) that many people are presently competing for the lowest income title under this government. Certainly Wakefield contains the lowest income area in the whole of Australia, which is the Yorke Peninsula-Lower North region. In 1991 it had an average annual personal income of $13,224. The other three lowest income areas were the statistical divisions of Murray Lands, which is in the electorates of Wakefield and Barker; Eyre, which is in the electorate of Grey; and the Wide Bay-Burnett area in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joke is really on the government in this particular case because having spent $291,000 on the cities of Port Pirie, Port Augusta and Whyalla and a total of $434,000 in the electorate of Grey, Minister Kelly found that the political stunt and the political bias did not work because the Liberal candidate, Barry Wakelin, was elected.

They did not support the wishes of their electorates, including clubs, in making applications for their grants. That has to be taken into account when looking at possible discrepancies which may or may not have been pointed out by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator O'Chee and Senator MacGibbon are having any influence on decision makers in these matters, that does cause me some concern, but I have noticed the balance in that former Senator Lady Flo Bjelke-Petersen was also giving support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address the matter of whether or not marginal seats got the money. The most marginal Labor seat in Western Australia&mdash;indeed, in Australia&mdash;was the seat of Stirling, held by Mr Ron Edwards. The safest opposition seat in Western Australia&mdash;I believe it is very close to being the safest seat in Australia&mdash;is the seat of O'Connor. Which got the most money? Senator Panizza is a great rural representative in Western Australia. I ask him: which got the most money? Which electorate in Western Australia, if we are looking at the allocations by electorate, got the least amount of money through this series of grants? Let me surprise the Senate. Let me surprise, particularly, Senator Panizza who is left speechless by the question I inadvertently addressed to him. It was the seat of Stirling which got the least amount of money. The safest opposition seat of O'Connor, with nearly 70 per cent of the vote, got far in excess of what was allocated within the region of Stirling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not stop there.

<PARA>In speaking to this document, I wish to refer briefly to that portion that comes under the heading, `Public Information'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the matter I raise comes quite fortuitously today from a constituent of mine.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent rang the Australian Securities Commission to ask that a form 304, `Change to officeholders', be sent to him, obviously so that he could complete and lodge it. He duly received the form 304 with a `with compliments' slip. Attached to that form were two other pieces of paper, those being documents advertising, effectively, a particular law service company, A.C. Fox and Associates. One of those pieces of paper has all the addresses of that firm; and the other is an order form so that, through that law service company, one may order and pay for ASC forms&mdash;the numbers are there and the price per copy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether this is normal practice and what the relationship is between the Australian Securities Commission or the ASC business centre and this particular law service firm.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that some time soon the minister will be able to provide the Senate with an answer as to how these things came to be enclosed or what the normal practice of the ASC business centre is in dealing with law service firms.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the annual report of the Australian Securities Commission. I commend the ASC on a substantial and thorough report, a report of much better quality than those of the last couple of years&mdash;although, it has to be said, they were settling in years. The report will be examined, of course, in more detail by the Corporations and Securities Committee&mdash;and I look forward to that. But on a cursory examination, I think it can be said that the report demonstrates that the ASC is settling down as an organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC has its data centre, as the report says, operating in its final home at Traralgon, which has details of the 839,593 companies that are registered with the commission. It has improved the services to companies through that data service, which involves the highest technology available including data imaging and innovations such as electronic lodgment of company annual returns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the ASC is notching up, as gleaned from the report, a creditable array of convictions. Despite the fact that many of these are tucked away in the finance pages of newspapers and not read by most, it is worth noting the following statement on page 24 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1992/93 the ASC concluded 93 major civil actions, with 60 orders or settlements substantially in the ASC's favour, 29 other settlements or orders, and four actions discontinued. Of 45 major criminal prosecutions, 34 resulted in convictions, three in acquittals, and eight matters were discontinued. Total litigation concluded during the year included 720 civil actions, with 572 orders or settlements substantially in the ASC's favour . . .</PARA>
<PARA>These are substantial figures that show that the ASC, along with the Director of Public Prosecutions, has not only been very active in mounting prosecutions but also very successful in gaining these outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 26 of the report contains a chart which gives a running score of the progress that is being made with the big 16 prosecutions that were first announced by Tony Hartnell, the first chairman of the ASC. I think it is worth looking at that chart to see how active the ASC has been in prosecuting those big 16 national priority matters originally identified by Tony Hartnell. I think again this shows commendable progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is disappointing that we have not put more of the big and notable operators of the 1980s behind bars where I think some of them belong&mdash;and I think that would be important in terms of the symbolic value of cutting loose from the 80s imagery&mdash;I understand that these are complex matters. The report shows that progress is being made towards this end. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the ASC is establishing itself as an efficient business operation. Its revenue raising is substantial and supplements the revenue that is made available by government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to note that the relations between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the ASC, following the unfortunate altercation made public last year at a public hearing of the corporations and securities committee meeting and resulting in a ministerial directive to get their act together, have improved markedly. The report indicates that the two agencies, having reached a formal agreement to ensure effective cooperation, are getting on well together. I think the results, in terms of the substantial number of important criminal matters before the courts, are testimony to that.</PARA>

<PARA>I rise to speak on some of the 23 treaties which the government tabled in the Senate this afternoon. I have no doubt that many of those treaties are most worthy documents and will be of assistance to this country. Of course, one cannot tell because the government has not given any sort of explanatory note in regard to some of these quite complex treaties to enable us to determine their purpose and what their impact will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises a fundamental issue. In many areas, particularly in relation to the United Nations, this government is treaty mad. As a consequence, merely by the stroke of the executive pen, a whole host of new obligations have been entered into without any consideration by this parliament or, indeed, any of the state parliaments which may well be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is comparatively unusual in this sense. We do not have a proper process to look at and review treaties, and to ensure that parliament has a chance to examine the nature of the treaties which are entered into. I think this makes us quite different from most other comparative countries. For example, in the US these treaties would have to be approved by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been raised before in the chamber. I think it is important that the Senate give closer consideration to what should be done to make sure that the treaty arrangements governments enter into are properly examined by this parliament. I now have 3 1/2 minutes in which to complete a brief comment on these 23 treaties, which, of course, is impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the treaties can come into effect by the mere stroke of the executive pen. Within these 23 treaties&mdash;I have had a quick look through them&mdash;there are some treaties of considerable importance. I notice that treaty No. 9 on this list is the treaty that we signed with the government of Nauru&mdash;the settlement of the International Court of Justice case. This case has cost the Australian taxpayers $107 million. The government has persistently refused to table the legal reasons why it decided to settle this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my hand the submission that the government made initially to the International Court of Justice which explained very carefully why we should not settle this case and why Australia did not have an obligation to pay $107 million. Since that earlier submission to the International Court of Justice, the government has changed its mind. Mr Keating went to an international gathering in Nauru. On the day he arrived he announced that the taxpayers would be paying compensation to Nauru of $107 million. As yet, I do not have any bit of evidence except the assurances by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) that there was a legal justification for carrying this out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This list also contains what looks to me to be a very important treaty. The so-called Vienna agreement is a very important document which will govern how particular treaties are interpreted in the international arena. As I have said, there is no covering note to explain to the Senate and interested senators the importance of this treaty. Nonetheless, I am sure, because it will govern the interpretation of many treaties that Australia has entered into, that it is a document of quite some significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final documents on the list relate to two UN committees to which Australians now have right of appeal. Again, they are short treaties and deal with the remuneration of members of those committees. I have long opposed the government's policy of overturning the philosophy of the Australia Act and allowing domestic disputes in this country to be examined by UN committees. These UN committees are not properly structured to carry out this work. I believe that this is quite contrary to the wishes of the Australian people and contrary to the philosophy of the Australia Act. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>My comments will be brief because I spoke on this matter during last Thursday's matter of public interest discussion. This report arises from a discussion paper put out by the Australian Stock Exchange. In turn, the discussion paper is a response to a proposal by Rupert Murdoch of Newscorp for the Australian Stock Exchange to waive its listing rule 3K to allow News Corporation to issue super voting shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the committee has not been able to see the Murdoch proposal, I understand that it was made clear that Newscorp wanted the decision made by January. According to newspaper reports and gossip around the business world, it is believed that it also signalled that if it is not successful then it will move its listing offshore. It is not an insignificant threat. Brokers' commissions from the trading of Newscorp over the last year, for example, may be as high as $60 million. Of course, the brokers are the same people who make the decisions at the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of serious questions are raised by the paper, and these are listed in the report. There is the possibility of the entrenchment of control by current major shareholders; the possibility of one group of shareholders in a company being able to increase its proportion of voting control without formal takeover or acquisition of equity; the possibility that such acquisition of control may be in breach of the takeover code as set out in chapter 6 of the corporations law; and the possibility that ordinary shareholders will lose rights and that, as a result, the value of their shareholding might diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally accepted in the industry that wherever the proposed changes have been introduced they have had the effect of keeping the present management in power&mdash;in this case, keeping the family in control. Page 4 of a publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Corporate Governance </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>, dated July-August 1992, released by the Investor Responsibility Research Centre in the United States, where this debate has been going on for some 10 years, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These recapitalizations often are used by family-controlled firms to ensure that family hegemony is preserved, even if the company issues large amounts of additional common stock, resulting in a dilution of the holdings of non-family stockholders.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee has been unable to give full consideration to the substantive question&mdash;that is, the merit of introducing super shares&mdash;simply because there has not been time to do it. However, the committee did want to comment on the process of making the decision, and the report focuses on five areas that go to this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the committee was particularly interested in the time allowed for responses to the discussion paper put out by the Australian Stock Exchange on the Wednesday before last. Responses are expected by 29 November, and a decision was expected to be made in the middle of December in readiness for a decision to be made by News Corporation shareholders in the middle of January.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is new to Australia, but it has been a long and bitter debate overseas, particularly in the United States and Canada. At page 4 of its report, the IRRC refers to the debate as one of the most incendiary corporate governance debates of the 1980s. And it is still unresolved. Yet the Australian Stock Exchange seemed keen to push the decision through in a time frame not designed to suit Australian shareholders, and not designed to suit the Australian business community, but designed to suit News Corporation Ltd. We do not think that is good enough. We think that the time ought to be extended for that reason. Recommendation (i) of the committee's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the ASX allow until the end of February 1994 for submission of views and comment on the complex issues raised in its discussion paper `Differential Voting Rights'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reasonable extension of time. It is not taking it out too far, but it is giving some time for the many interested groups in the community, many of whom have contacted us, formally and informally, to respond to what is a very complex issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that the committee was interested in was that the principle of one share, one vote is a fundamental principle and that any change to that principle needs very serious consideration. In fact overseas trends, if anything, seem to be in the opposite direction to that proposed by the ASX. The trend overseas&mdash;in continental Europe, England, Canada and the United States&mdash;seems to be back towards re-enfranchising voters and moving back to the principle of one share, one vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing that the committee was particularly concerned about was the impact on the Australian Stock Exchange and whether the Australian Stock Exchange had the capacity to make the detached and objective assessment that needs to be made in this very difficult area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have already talked about the influence that a company the size of News Corporation can bring to bear on the Australian Stock Exchange&mdash;by dint of its brokerage fees, if nothing else. We are wondering whether the headlong rush to make a decision here is not precipitate and unnecessary, and whether that demonstrates that the Australian Stock Exchange does not have the true independence to be able to make a detached and objective assessment. We are concerned also about the impact that this might have on the Australian Stock Exchange and its reputation overseas. We believe that it might well undermine its integrity. The very speed with which it is dealing with this issue might be seen to be answering the call of one big listed company. We believe that this might undermine the ASX's credibility and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that the committee was concerned about was the need for the Attorney-General, the Australian Securities Commission and government to be fully involved both in responding to the Australian Stock Exchange's discussion paper and in looking at the longer term issue of who should be making decisions on really fundamental issues like this&mdash;whether it is good enough to leave it to, effectively, a self-regulatory regime governed by the ASX or whether the government should not be involved at a much earlier stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned, for example, that if a waiver is suggested by the ASX, the government has no control over what might happen. If a listing rule change is suggested, then section 774 of the corporations law does allow the Attorney-General 28 days to disallow that change to the listing rules. A waiver does not give him that same power, although we do note that in a letter to the committee, which is included in the report, the ASX has committed itself to a course of action which would involve both the corporations and securities committee and the Attorney-General should a waiver be decided. Recommendations (iii) and (iv) go to that involvement of the ASC and the Attorney-General. Recommendation No. 3 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That both the ASC and the Attorney-General prepare a response to the ASX discussion paper `Differential Voting Rights' and publish those responses.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 4 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Attorney-General examine the longer term implications of decisions on such fundamental issues as differential voting rights for shares being made by bodies which may be subject to undue pressure and/or face possible conflicts of interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth thing the committee was interested in was that if any change were to be made, it should be by a change to the listing rules for the reasons that I have already indicated. If something is good in principle, then the rules ought to be changed for everybody and the proper process given the right to go through. If a listing change is made, for example, the Attorney-General has 28 days to disallow it. He has some time in which to examine that listing change and he has the capacity to disallow it in consultation with the ASC and, presumably, the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does not support the idea of waiver&mdash;the approach of case-by-case exemptions&mdash;as a good way of applying their rules. Recommendation (ii) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that any change in ASX requirements which would permit alteration to the current one-share-one-vote rule should be implemented by means of amendment to the ASX listing rules. The Committee strongly opposes the introduction of such changes by waiver on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA>The report is a simple but important response dealing with process because we simply do not have time to deal with the substance or merit of the case, but we think it is most important to let the Australian Stock Exchange and the business community know that the process is not acceptable to the committee and that we will be following this debate very closely. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business  notices of motion nos 455 and 456 standing in his name for this day, relating to orders for the production of documents by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) concerning the allocation of grants under the Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that yesterday, somewhat astonishingly, the Senate refused to refer to its own estimates committee the question of financial concerns that arose out of the allocation by Mrs Kelly, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, of the sporting, recreational and community grants. The Senate is also well aware of the Auditor-General's report which raised these very serious worries that, in fact, moneys may have been allocated other than in an objective way and that they may have been allocated on a determination based on political bias. This is a very serious matter and one would have thought that the Senate would have leapt at the opportunity to analyse this issue and resolve some of the supplementary issues that were left outstanding by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue was, of course, that the Auditor-General was unable to get from the minister the documentary evidence that was necessary to make a determination as to the basis upon which she chose one grant applicant over another. The Auditor-General was referred back to the department and the department simply did not have the necessary documents. Therefore, it is only the parliament that has the capacity to get to the bottom of this matter and it is the Senate, with its proud record of doing its best to ensure proper financial accountability of the government, to which the Australian people look. In this instance, however, the Australian Democrats and the Greens refused to support the Senate in its quest to simply recall the appropriate estimates committee in order that it might examine this matter. It is not a major request of the committee; it is quite a simple, standard, ordinary, everyday occurrence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What had occurred in this instance was that the Auditor-General's report had been put down a few days after notice would have had to have been given for the supplementary hearings of that estimates committee and, therefore, the relevant questions were not raised. Now that the Auditor-General has put that report down, the very serious concerns are on the public record. A sensible course of action would have been for the Senate to recall the estimates committee and have the matter looked at. It could have been done in the course of one day's debate. The Senate would have had the opportunity to question the minister, the minister's representative in this place and the department to find out exactly where the truth was in this very dubious circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, however, the Australian Democrats and the Greens decided that, because the matter was before a House of Representatives committee, there was no necessity for this chamber to meet its responsibility. A House of Representatives committee, I remind the Senate, acts in accordance with the numbers in the House of Representatives. It simply does not have an independent authority. It gets instructions from the majority and it acts in accordance with the determination of that majority. That is why the accountability function of this chamber, apart from the expertise that it has built up over a long period of time, can be more appropriately brought to bear to find the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government does not have the numbers in this chamber. One would have thought that the majority, made up of the coalition, the Greens and the Democrats, would have got on with the job that this Senate exists for, which is to ensure the financial propriety of the government. But the Democrats and the Greens abdicated that responsibility. They determined that this parliament would not meet that responsibility and that the committee would not be allowed to function in the way in which it has been structured to achieve the objects for which it has been structured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's decision was astonishing. But nevertheless, that was yesterday's debate. It was a sad day when the Democrats and the Greens were not prepared to stand up and say, `We demand that this government account, and that the investigation of the Auditor-General be pursued by this chamber in order to answer the so far unanswered questions'. Anyway, that was yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I am seeking an order of the Senate that the documents that Minister Kelly and the department have that are relevant to this matter be tabled in the Senate by tomorrow. They are all obviously available because they have been searched in the last few days, as evidenced in an answer from Senator Schacht today. We are requesting that they be tabled in the Senate tomorrow so that honourable senators and the Australian public can make a determination through another means about where the truth is to be found in Minister Kelly's very doubtful exercise of her role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a major exercise that is being sought of the Senate; it is a pretty simple task. The documents are at hand. They can simply be tabled in accordance with an order of the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get the air completely clear about any misapprehension created by the opposition that there are secret documents or papers. The Auditor-General, the Australian National Audit Office, had full access to all that material. I inform the Senate that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has already reached an agreement with the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which is chaired by Mr Langmore, that it will also have complete access to all the documents that Senator Hill is now seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Senate decided not to recall an estimates committee because it did not see any necessity in duplicating the effort of the standing committee in the House of Representatives. I believe that Senator Hill now wants to duplicate the effort of tabling the documents that will be made available to the House of Representatives committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill has been very disparaging about the performance of Liberal and National Party members of the House of Representatives who serve on House of Representatives standing committees. He has said that unless one is a senator with experience on estimates committees one does not have the ability to ask questions and seek information in this House of Representatives committee inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An estimates committee in this place automatically has a majority of government members. The chairperson of the committee is given both a deliberative and a casting vote if the vote is tied. Of course the government has a majority in the House of Representatives committees. But both sorts of committees have government majorities. To say that the House of Representatives Liberal members, including the likes of Mr Costello and others who have led the debate for the Liberal Party, cannot ask decent questions and that only Senate Liberals can is an absurd reflection by the Senate Liberals on their colleagues in the lower house. We believe that the process that is now under way will mean that all the documents will be made relevantly available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill has requested that all the last round applications be tabled. There were 2,863 applications for the last round. Some of them are only a few pages in length; others apparently run into hundreds of pages. Photocopying all those original documents and tabling them in the Senate tomorrow would present some physical difficulty. It is estimated that it would mean six filing cabinets of material would be dumped on the table of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that members of the Senate could go off and spend days and weeks pursuing each of these documents. But the House of Representatives committee will do that properly and appropriately in accordance with its work program, as it has had the Auditor's report referred to it for investigation. I do not think that, for the sake of creating a disturbance&mdash;that is basically what it is about&mdash;it is reasonable to call for these documents to be tabled here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill has mentioned my making reference to a couple of documents today in question time. They were accessed from a particular application because yesterday in the House of Representatives the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) made accusations about a number of the programs.

As has already been outlined, these documents are available. They will be made available to the House of Representatives committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that Senator Schacht has gone, because he is the minister who recalled an estimates committee because he had some more information that he wanted to give it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A House of Representatives committee has been formed. As I understand it from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, Mr Langmore has said that the committee is talking about holding meetings in private, perhaps next February, with the Auditor-General present. That is not an adequate way for this matter to be given full, frank and open public debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not really know what documents the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has. Senator Schacht today trotted out some letters. They were obviously some of the documents that the minister had which Senator Schacht chose to use and, I understand, which the minister chose to use in the other place as some sort of evidence of coalition members' support for the grants. In this particular case, we do not know what documents the minister has and we do not know on what basis the decisions were made. The Auditor-General's report stated that some 11 per cent of the grants that were made in response to requests did not fit the criteria previously used by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Those requests had previously been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has some right to know what made the department and, particularly, the minister's office change their minds so that those people whom it had previously been decided did not have the proper qualifications under the objectives to receive grants all of a sudden did receive grants. I have my own suspicions as to why they changed their minds, but some of the documentation that would be available from the minister's office might help to reinforce some of those suspicions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot for the life of me understand why Senator Lees, speaking on behalf of the Democrats, should want to leave such an important matter to a House of Representatives committee. As I said only last night, I understand that the Democrats believe that it is their responsibility to keep the government honest. It has been put another way, but I will leave it at that. Yet she would allow this committee&mdash;which has no representation from the Democrats whatsoever&mdash;to do the work which could be done by a Senate committee on which the Democrats could be properly represented.

Whether those opposite accept the contents of the documents or whether they put a different perspective or a different colour on the documents will remain to be seen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993 and indicate that the coalition will be supporting this bill. It seeks to increase the appropriation for the Aboriginal education strategic initiative program. It is through this program that Aboriginal education is funded and evaluated as part of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy which commenced in 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular measures in this bill seek to increase funding for the years 1993 to 1995. It will seek to increase the appropriations for this program by approximately $2 million over a 2 1/2-year period. The extra money will contribute to some very important educational programs which are specifically targeted to help Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This funding for education is particularly important as was stated by the Aboriginal education policy task force in 1988. The government's Aboriginal education policy is largely based on the report of the education policy task force. In the report the task force said that it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . deeply concerned that in spite of several improvements in educational opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over the last two decades, the disadvantage faced by Aboriginal people in securing their right to education remains far more severe than for any other group in Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>These findings of five years ago are just as relevant today. Aboriginal education has certainly improved over the last few years with slight increases in participation in higher education and a better improvement in school retention rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participation in higher education by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people rose from 0.5 per cent in 1987 to 0.9 per cent in 1992. The year 8 to year 12 retention rate in Australia has risen from 17 per cent in 1986 to over 30 per cent in 1990. Additionally, the proportion of Aboriginals who have not attended school fell from 33 per cent to eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although these improvements are very good, they do not really go far enough. We need parity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in both participation and outcome. Until we have this, we need to ensure that the funding for these programs is properly targeted. An important start is the fact that the goals and educational principles of the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy is endorsed by all governments in Australia. This is essential if we are to have a coherent and coordinated approach to national Aboriginal education policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the major long-term aims of this policy, which are to increase ATSIC involvement in educational decision making, to ensure equality of access to educational services, to achieve equity in Aboriginal participation and to enable equitable and appropriate educational outcomes. The policy also allows for the Commonwealth to fulfil a strategic planning and monitoring role while the states concentrate on implementation. This is sensible, as is the high degree of Aboriginal involvement in the decision making process in implementing and developing the policy. The coalition supports all of these things but the question remains: are we achieving enough? This is what all Australians must ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal education strategic initiative program, which provides funding specifically to supplement educational funding arrangements, is the program affected by this legislation. A multitude of reports and article on Aboriginal education, including the Hughes report, have identified various common factors contributing to the continuing low level of education in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community. These include: lack of access&mdash;for example, living in remote out-stations; lack of cultural suitability of the education; language difficulties; lack of understanding and appreciation of cultural differences in non-Aboriginal communities, often resulting in the marginalisation of Aboriginal children in the school system and consequent lack of self-esteem; poverty, leading to poor health; and unfavourable conditions of home study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal education policy has set three main objectives for the second triennium of 1993-95. These are: firstly, the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which specifically relate to education; and, secondly, the implementation of the national Aboriginal languages and literacy and strategy, which aims to improve the English literacy of Aboriginal primary and secondary students, particularly those for whom English is not a third language. It also focuses upon the teaching of Aboriginal languages in schools and supports regional language centres and community projects. The third objective is the implementation of the national reconciliation and schooling strategy, which aims to promote the reconciliation process through the schools system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, while these admirable objectives should be fulfilled, the policy has set reasonably vague priorities for the next three years. It would be preferable if the government set specific targets at which to aim. We should be specifically aiming for higher retention rates and participation rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hughes report actually recommends setting benchmarks, suggesting that state and territory governments be encouraged to recognise the extent of non-participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in education. It suggested adopting targets for increasing participation of Aboriginal children in primary and secondary schooling from 85 per cent to near 100 per cent and lifting retention rates of Aboriginal students from year 8 through to year 12 from a rate of 17 per cent to at least 65 per cent by the year 2000. Why is the government so reluctant to set such benchmarks? The policy of the government should be more firm about what it is attempting to achieve and the coalition believes we need more measurable outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further criticism of the current policy is that it lacks flexibility. The coalition believes that Aboriginal education, as with all education, should be based on choice. Over the past few years there have been various points of view surrounding the question of systems of independent education for the Aboriginal community. There have been instances where Aboriginal people themselves have set up independent schools. Some of these have been successful and some have not. This is a reflection, of course, of what happens in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excellent examples of such schools exist. Some of these in New South Wales are very successful, where parents have had the choice of sending their children to mixed stream classes or to Aboriginal children only classes. Although this was initially criticised as a separatist approach, it went ahead with parental approval. The results have been that Aboriginal children are now making much better educational progress. One notable success is that of the St Ignatius Catholic School in Bourke. St Ignatius reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attendance figures have soared, staff turnover has dropped and the marks of Aboriginal children now range across the board in school tests.</PARA>
<PARA>These positive outcomes have given credit to the idea&mdash;and this is the kind of flexibility that is needed in our educational system&mdash;that if Aboriginal children are to get the most benefit from the money which goes towards them in education we need the flexibility of approach that we have seen at schools such as St Ignatius. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the broader Australian community, if we could have separate schools for girls, different schools for religious affiliations and remedial classes for children with learning difficulties, our education system should be flexible enough to accommodate Aboriginal only classes if the results show marked improvements in education. It is particularly important, however, that such plans are carried out with the complete understanding and approval of parents and that they always constitute positive action, as opposed to separatism. There are many who might think that this positive action constitutes separatism or even apartheid. However, there is a very clear distinction, for apartheid acts to restrict options. Enforced separatism assigns control to the dominant power and limits choice, with the aim of containment. Positive discrimination, on the other hand, relies on a good measure of support from the community and it aims to assist this, as is the formula used by St Ignatius where the emphasis is on parental consultation and continuing choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the diversity in our educational system already, the funding under this program should take into account the different needs of Aboriginal children throughout Australia. Education is one of the greatest needs of our Aboriginal children. It has been shown that the attrition rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students at university was around 40 per cent. Part of the reason for this was the cultural differences and the different values for Aboriginal students as opposed to mainstream students in areas relating to academic success. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the Democrats are quite ready to accept and endorse much of the content and sentiment expressed by Senator Tierney, we will present an individual reaction to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill. The bill allocates funds for the Aboriginal education strategic initiatives program and continues the Commonwealth government's national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the government introduced the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education policy and identified long-term goals. Those goals have been identified by Senator Tierney. They include: the involvement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in educational decision making; equality of access to educational services; equity of educational participation and appropriate educational outcomes. An evaluation of the AEP scheme was announced this year to determine the effectiveness of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of the rates and types of participation by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in education reveals some significant statistics. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in all forms of education is the lowest experienced by any group in Australia. Aboriginal enrolments have increased in higher education. Between 1982 and 1992 enrolments rose from 0.3 per cent of total enrolments to one per cent, which translates into 854 students increasing to 5,105 students. Clearly, there is still room for a great deal of improvement there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although the completion rates for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students have almost doubled in the four years from 1988 to 1991, this is not reflected in the total number of higher education completions, which have also increased from 0.4 per cent to 0.6 per cent. Some of the specific problems associated with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students include a high level of attrition, on average a longer course completion time for degrees and a lack of particular services for Aboriginal students on campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that the government eventually withdrew the punitive and unfair budget proposal for a minimum time rule in higher education. It was proposed that students who failed to complete their degree in the minimum time would have incurred a 50 per cent increase in their HECS debt for each additional unit of time that was taken. It is important to acknowledge that it was as a result of combined Democrat, student and, eventually, opposition pressure that the government did excise this clause from the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill. All of those who added to that pressure on the government are to be congratulated, as is the government itself to be congratulated for finally seeing the light. It was that particular proposal which was estimated to have a particular effect on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, who are likely to take longer than the minimum time to complete their tertiary courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government has developed education strategies to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation in higher education. As part of its equity strategy the Commonwealth meets with institutions to determine their profiles but, despite incentives for institutions in the form of funding to increase the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, most institutions fall short of their goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government contradicts its own rhetoric about access and equity by imposing financial disincentives to entering and participating in higher education on all traditionally disadvantaged groups. It seems quite duplicitous for the government to purport to a commitment to access and equity when it imposes barriers to increased educational opportunities for groups such as women, mature age students, those from low income backgrounds, people who are disabled and people who come from indigenous backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This duplicity is illustrated by the fact that, on the one hand, the government is encouraging further participation but, on the other hand, budgetary measures, or so-called budgetary measures, are having the effect of positively discouraging that very participation. To illustrate that, we have only to look at the regressive changes to education in this year's budget, such as double HECS payments for second degrees, increased repayment rates and levels for HECS itself and an increase in student loans. They are all financial disincentives and they are all financial barriers for all students, but they are especially effective in placing a barrier in front of those from lower socioeconomic groups, in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are disproportionately represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Australian Democrats oppose these budget changes, in particular the decision to double HECS for second degrees. Again, this is a measure that will discourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders from undertaking second degrees. The Democrats will vote against these HECS measures and, if the government and the opposition are sincere in their rhetoric about access and equity in higher education, they will oppose the changes also. I must say that we often hear the phrase `access and equity'. It is glib, it is easy to say, but it is not true that the more you say it, the greater the access and the equity. There has to be consideration of the effects of the actual measures that are being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the area of student financial assistance, the Commonwealth provides Abstudy, which assists some 40,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. Unlike the other parties, the Australian Democrats are committed to providing adequate levels of student financial assistance for students. The government offers below poverty line income support with restricted eligibility criteria and penalties for students who wish to earn additional money through employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the key features of the government's Aboriginal educational policy for the second triennium because it includes the implementation of the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the national Aboriginal languages and literacy strategy and the national reconciliation and schooling strategy. But we insist that the relevant recommendations of the royal commission be implemented as soon as possible. We are glad to see the increased employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education workers and the expansion of preschool services that will begin from 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Aboriginal literacy strategy which commenced this year is an important strategy that will provide indigenous people with the opportunity to improve their English if it is not their first language. This is an important measure at a time when as many as 10 to 20 per cent of the Australian adult population is considered functionally illiterate. That is according to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Words at work</EMPHASIS>, a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into literacy needs in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of Aboriginal studies in the process of reconciliation cannot be underestimated. It is a significant step towards enriching our whole culture as well as providing indigenous people with a chance to see their history, achievements and culture reflected in and not written out of our history. We must recognise the important role of education in self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small inroads have been made during the past 20 years in the area of improved education for indigenous people. Retention rates in secondary schools and participation in higher education have increased but, as I stressed earlier, there is still a long way to go. As Senator Tierney rightly said, it is the measurement of such outcomes which determines the success of the theories. It is appropriate to keep monitoring those particular outcomes as an objective test of the rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has an obligation to provide all Australians with an accessible and equitable&mdash;those words again&mdash;education system. Yet this is one area in which the opposition and the government are failing Australians as they further entrench this fallacy of user-pays education. Many of the government's initiatives contained in the Aboriginal education policy are commendable, but I urge the government to reconsider its overall attitude towards education which sees students paying more in individual contributions, particularly those from traditionally disadvantaged backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders make up one of these disadvantaged groupings. They have the lowest level of representation in the education sector. Government platitudes are not enough. A genuine commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders involves removing obstacles, some of which I outlined just now. These are the obstacles that prevent and discourage people of all sizes, shapes and descriptions, but they have a particular effect on those who are disadvantaged. These people are discouraged. It is that very discordance between the policy of glibly saying, `We are encouraging a certain group of people', or `We are making particular policy efforts to encourage another group of people', and then delivering up a budgetary measure which has the opposite effect. The opposite effect is the one which has to be worn, particularly by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal coalition welcomes the Forest Industries Research Levy Bill 1993 and cognate bills. The bills before us provide for the establishment and funding of a Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation which the forestry industry has sought for some time. To finance the corporation and its activities, there will be a levy on wood produced in and exported from Australia as unprocessed wood, and on unprocessed wood and certain classes of primary processed forest products imported into Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Commonwealth and state governments already contribute to research through their various departments and the CSIRO, the Australian Forestry Industry Council, consisting of the relevant state and federal ministers, believes more can be done. All major reports on the forest industry&mdash;including the Resource Assessment Commission's 1992 forest and timber inquiry, the National Plantations Advisory Committee and the ESD working group on forest use&mdash;have echoed the urgent need for a better coordinated and better focused research program. All believe that more research is essential if Australia is to increase productivity and value adding in the forests and wood product industries, and to manage our forests in an ecologically sustainable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation will identify national research priorities and assess research gaps. Moreover, it will commission, administer and evaluate research into a broad range of areas relating to wood production, extraction, processing, economics and marketing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation to be formed must prepare a five-year plan in consultation with the industry as well as annual operating plans for each financial year, which are consistent with its five-year plan. Annual reports will be tabled in parliament and available to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to finance for the corporation. The amount of levy to be paid by industry will be set by regulation. However, it will not exceed the legislated maximum rate of 0.5 per cent of the average value of production of that class of wood and, from what I understand, it is likely to be well below that maximum. The Forest Industries Research Levy Bill 1993 relates to the levy on unprocessed wood delivered to a mill and this levy will take effect on 1 January 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four different levy rates will apply to different classes of wood: hardwood sawlogs, softwood sawlogs, hardwood pulp logs and softwood pulp logs. The levy is not only payable on domestic wood but, through the Forest Industries Research Import Charge Bill 1993, is also payable on imported unprocessed wood. A separate account will ensure that money collected from imports is spent on research and development relevant to the timber importing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Forest Industries Research Export Charge Bill 1993 collects the levy on unprocessed wood that is exported instead of being delivered to a mill. The Commonwealth will provide $1 for every $2 collected from the domestic industry to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of the gross value of production of the industry. The reason why the Commonwealth contribution is $1 to $2 and not dollar for dollar, as with other primary industries, is that only half the industry has a primary industry focus&mdash;that is, tree production and small rural sawmills as opposed to the other half of the industry which is based on manufacturing. The Commonwealth will not match import levy funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is expected that annual contributions from the domestic industry will be around $700,000. The effectiveness of the corporation will be reviewed in 1995-96. It is important to note that the timber industry has enormous potential for growth and that, until now, it has largely concentrated on the domestic market which supplies some two-thirds of Australia's needs. Yet Australia imports more than $2.4 billion worth of timber product, much of it high value pulp and paper products, and exports only $775 million worth of product, leaving a deficit of $1.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) believes that there is no guarantee that this situation will change. He recently told the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, I believe that it could get worse. All the best research arrangements in the world, or in Australia, will not do anything to overcome that very bad trade deficit unless there is security for investment to expand the utilisation of our forests&mdash;whether native or plantation.</PARA>
<PARA>With resource security, the forest industry can and will expand. As a prominent value adding industry, it will be able to create thousands of jobs and reduce not just Australia's trade deficit in timber products but help boost exports. The ACTU estimates that nearly $7 billion worth of job creating investment in this country is being tied up by what is euphemistically known as `green tape'. Much of that is in the development of products from forests and plantations which are, unquestionably, a renewable and sustainable resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the government seems little short of paralysed when it comes to making decisions about the future of the forest industries. We have seen arguments between ministers about whether exports of woodchips will be phased out altogether after the year 2000; we have seen a failure to obtain resource security for the 1,200 timber mills scattered across Australia; and we have seen a minister in charge of forests have the ground cut out from under him. We can only conclude that the government never wanted resource security legislation but rather the image of friendliness to the timber industry and forest industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the federal coalition's policy was, and is, to legislate for resource security without any reference to the size of the project. We believe that the sawmill that wants to spend money on a veneer plant, a drying process or anything that adds value to timber has just as much right to be guaranteed supply as does a pulp mill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been about 18 reports by committees of inquiry into the forest industry, and it is difficult to think of any that the industry lost or that found against the industry and its continued expansion. The so-called mother of all inquiries was undertaken by the Resource Assessment Commission. It took years to complete, used almost an entire forest to produce its report and was favourable to the forest industry. The industry might then have expected to be allowed to get on with the job. But no, the government responded with yet another inquiry; this time it was by the Industry Commission and it also turned out to be favourable. So will the industry now get the legislation which the Industry Commission says is necessary, the Resource Assessment Commission says is required, the opposition has proposed and which is unquestionably vital to the future of the industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition recognises that the most efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sound method of forest management is an integrated harvest system. If a tree is to be cut down for sawlogs, it is important to use it all. Apart from pulp mills and the few places in Australia which value-add by turning the chips into board, which can then be veneered or turned into furniture, the rest is exported or far too often burnt on the forest floor. Unfortunately, there are still people who believe that the industry logs native forests just for woodchips. In fact, it is difficult to get rid of chippable material at the moment. The lack of market for forest thinnings and sawlog residue is costing jobs and making sawlogs, and therefore timber, dearer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise the difficulty of persuading people to invest in plantations in Australia, mainly because of the long delay between planting and harvesting. We need to encourage more people to invest in farming trees and developing plantations, and address the current inequity and disincentive in the taxation system. As my colleague the member for Gippsland pointed out in the House of Representatives:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of a forestry research and development corporation is long overdue and greatly needed. I know all too well that the industry has suffered a long investment drought. It is necessary only to have looked at the CSIRO's old Division of Forest Products as it struggled to obtain industry funding for its important research programs to have recognised the scale of this problem. In some regions throughout Australia little more than a tractor has been provided over the past decade, let alone a heavily industry funded research program.</PARA>

So the Democrats are prepared to support these bills as long as the government enforces the strategy to protect old-growth forest and wilderness areas; in other words, we are prepared to support the policy in toto, not in bits and pieces.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these bills make it perfectly obvious where the government's priorities lie. Unfortunately, the government's priority is to develop at all costs and be damned with the environmental consequences. Here we have a package of bills which give effect to the commitment on research and development in the national forest policy whilst the commitment on forest conservation in the same policy is being violated. It is being violated even as we speak in this chamber tonight, and it has been violated around the country in every single state, including Tasmania, which, as I said earlier, did not assent to the national forest policy. Nonetheless, the federal government still has the power&mdash;corporations powers, trade and commerce powers, external affairs powers, heritage powers and so on&mdash;to make the policy bite in Tasmania even though that state had not assented to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few weeks ago the Senate debated an urgency motion put forward by Senator Chamarette on the need for the government to implement its own forest conservation policy. Clearly, the government is failing to do so. The substance of my question yesterday to Senator Cook indicated quite clearly that the government is prepared to sit on its hands until 1995 or 1998 with respect to public and private lands in which, in time, most of the old-growth forests will have been seriously damaged, if not removed altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I said in my speech to Senator Chamarette's motion some weeks ago, not only is the federal government failing to act in this important respect but it even propounds the view that there is nothing it can do to save the forests. As I have indicated, this is blatantly wrong; it is not true. The federal government has a number of constitutional powers which it can use to stop logging in old-growth forests. The simple fact is that it lacks the political will to take tough action to save our forest heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the office of the Minister for Resources propounds the view that the so-called moratorium clause in the national forest policy statement does not actually mean what it says. I will quote that section to honourable senators so that we are in no doubt what the national forest policy says, and what the states, with the exception of Tasmania, and the Commonwealth have actually assented to. The policy says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . until assessments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of forest conservation values, including old-growth values&mdash;</PARA>

One cannot go on doing that sort of thing and retain the values which are inherent in the notion of ecologically sustainable development. Such a notion requires, among other things, the preservation of equity between generations, the maintenance of options for future generations similar to the options which are available to the present generation. The destruction of wilderness is then clearly a violation of that principle of equity between the generations.

In natural ecological systems most of the niches are already filled and one cannot destroy part of that forest and expect the animals to leave that area and find places in untouched areas of other forests.

When one recognises that the value of money in 1927 was a tiny fraction of what money is today&mdash;this is not presented in 1993 dollars&mdash;that $1.086 billion is an absolutely massive subsidy which has gone into forestry in Victoria.

I know that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is a heavily burdened committee. The committee system in this parliament is continually being stressed by reductions of funding from the executive and I do not think that the finance and public administration committee can do a lot more work on this to actually solve the problem of quangos. </PARA>

This commitment to research is outlined in the national forest policy statement, which was signed by the Commonwealth government and all state governments, except that of Tasmania, in December 1992. The document exists largely because the Commonwealth government failed to obtain the support of this parliament for the resource security legislation which was debated in this chamber earlier in 1992. The document was initially negotiated secretly between governments and industry and ultimately reflects this lack of commitment to public consultation and to concerns about conservation issues.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, this may seem a reasonable proposition for the forest industries and for the Commonwealth government to be pursuing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, the destruction of our native forests will be secured and will be used to fund research into sustainable options for the forest industries&mdash;an extraordinary piece of logic.

The ecological aspect, however, needs to be stressed. The continuation of any practices that involve the destruction of old-growth or wilderness forests is not ecologically sustainable. In my home state of Western Australia for example, the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management is logging many areas of forest that are of high conservation value. Some of those areas were identified in a joint assessment of the southern forest region by CALM and the Australian Heritage Commission in the late 1980s. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of clear-felling large areas of native forests on relatively short rotations and encouraging regrowth using mechanical or chemical thinning is also not ecologically sustainable, particularly where the native forest that is destroyed is being used for woodchips or charcoal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal point I wish to make in this context is that the national forest policy statement also contains extensive provisions relating to the protection of high conservation native forests. The statement outlines a methodology for establishing an agreed set of criteria on which to base a reserve system and to protect those reserved forest areas. So far&mdash;this is referred to on page 10 of the document&mdash;the government is committed to the establishment of criteria. But the criteria, which it is claimed will be based on principles of comprehensiveness, adequacy and representativeness, have not been released for public debate or consideration. These criteria must be released publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also suggest that the imbalance in relation to approaching the national forest policy that these bills represent must be addressed. Those criteria are very valuable and should precede any kind of levy that is being charged on forest products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy to protect old-growth forests contains five basic elements. One of them is an interim provision that requires the state agencies responsible for forest management to place an embargo on any forest management activities that may significantly affect those areas of high conservation value that are likely to be placed into a reserve system. This policy of setting up a forest industries research levy is one of those practices that potentially could be endangering these high conservation areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A moratorium is required in the strategy contained in the national forest policy statement to protect old-growth forests and wilderness.

All you will do is set back the cause of the genuine environmentalists. You will set back job opportunities for people who work in the timber industry; you will set back the opportunity of people in regional Australia to actually gain productive income from the land; and you will set back the opportunity for us to do things with the land other than split it up for subdivision and put houses on it. In many cases, we are talking about very fertile, very productive soil. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a couple of comments in relation to some of Senator O'Chee's remarks. A number of industries in Australia receive 150 per cent research rebates. Here we are raising money at the cost of the demise of old-growth forests so we can fund plantation research. In Western Australia, the department of conservation and land management has known for years about the potential for harvesting in sustainable ways, about the potential for agroforestry, but it has not done anything about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales, softwood plantations have been languishing for years. They have the potential to generate employment&mdash;the potential to be used. They have not been thinned properly, they have not been serviced properly and they have not been trimmed. Perhaps, as a timber resource, they are becoming less and less valuable. The research has been there. A lot of the information, as Senator Coulter has said, has been around for a long time. What is lacking is the political will to make the decisions which really lead to an ecologically sustainable industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Chamarette indicated earlier, we have had major concerns in relation to the package of forest bills which are before us today. One of our principal concerns is that the industry research aspect of the national forest policy statement is being implemented without a complementary commitment to the conservation provisions of the statement. In addition, and applied to that point, is the ludicrous implication of the funding mechanism&mdash;that research into a supposedly ecologically sustainable forest industry is, in part, being funded through the destruction of native forests. So here we are. We have no guarantee that the money which is being raised in this way is going to the purpose to which it is supposed to be going. It not specified anywhere in the legislation. The Greens and the conservation movement are united in their opposition to this proposed funding mechanism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The forest industries research bills do not appear to contain any levy differential between logs removed from native forests, sometimes of high conservation value, and logs removed from plantations or agroforestry operations. The logical conclusion to that is that if any kind of tax of that nature does not discriminate it is obvious to pull out the higher value logs. Whilst this may be done by regulations, there does not appear to have been a commitment by the government in this regard. I understand that the regulations will be the subject of negotiation between the office of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the forestry industry. I fear that there will be little support from industry for such a price difference. In many cases the companies are involved in both plantations and native forest logging. If such a differential were established by regulation it would assist in encouraging a move to ecologically sustainable forestry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, this commitment to the ecologically sustainable management of our native forests is incorporated into the national forest policy statement. It is being blatantly ignored by this government as well as by the state governments which are signatories to the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact remains that many options are available for the forest industry to move to a truly sustainable basis in this country. Not only will this provide opportunities for employment for future generations but also in the short-term will assist in halting the decline in employment in the forest industries. This decline in employment has been due to the increasing capitalisation of the industry and the elimination of many of the smaller and, should I say, more efficient mills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An ecologically sustainable forest industry should be based on plantations on already cleared land, agroforestry, smaller timber mills, small scale environmentally friendly pulp mills and other downstream processing operations, such as ecotourism and the furniture and craft industries. All of these operations acknowledge the need to protect the ecological integrity of our precious and unique native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, I have had the opportunity to visit various regional centres in the south west of Western Australia to see first hand the excellent and often unfunded work being carried out by people committed to an ecologically sustainable forest industry. On one farming property near Bridgetown the farmer has introduced agroforestry onto his property both as an additional cash crop but also to assist in maintaining the ecological integrity of the farm. He has virtually maintained the same stocking rates by incorporating 50 to 20 metre gaps between rows of trees. As a consequence, he has also recorded astonishing growth rates in the plantation crop. This is a truly win win situation. The establishment of agroforestry operations such as this, together with the expansion of plantations on already cleared land, will provide the feed stock for other value adding industries to assist the regional economies of the south west as well as many other regions in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware, for example, of a proposal being developed for a pulp mill in the south west of Western Australia. The Greens would support the concept of value adding, but agree with the concerns of conservationists that there is not currently sufficient plantation feed stock to operate such a mill. The use of native forest timber in this regard is neither acceptable nor ecologically sustainable. The Greens would advocate the establishment of a few smaller pulp mills located centrally to various regional plantation sources. In addition, the pulp mills would need to be close loop and based on a non-chlorine bleaching process. This would be achieved if plantation timber were used as feed stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of ecotourism should not be underestimated. For example, in the south west of Western Australia many more people are employed in the tourist industry than in the forest and timber industry. One of the main attractions for many of these tourists are the unique karri and jarrah forests that are found in Western Australia. Tourists do not travel thousands of miles to see clear-felled areas where forests once stood or the uniform ecologically imbalanced regrowth that is encouraged in its place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The craft and fine furniture industries are also major contributors to the tourist industry and to regional economies. In Pemberton, in the south west of Western Australia, there is a fine example of a craft gallery run on ecologically sound principles. The owners have encouraged the use of mill offcuts and timber that would normally be burnt by mill owners as scrap for use in craft and furniture operations. Wood chippers are continuing to burn much of that waste despite its use as habitat or in fine craft highly value added goods. The building that houses this craft shop uses many timbers traditionally shunned by builders and the timber industry for structural and other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these examples point to the opportunities that are available for moving the forest and timber industries on to a truly sustainable basis. Research into these options should, however, not be funded by cutting the native forests that we should be protecting. It is on this basis that the Greens will not be supporting this package of bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We trust that the government will consult more widely in the future before proposing unsustainable policy principles such as those outlined in these bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the forest industries bills on behalf of the coalition. These bills seek to establish the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. I am very much in favour of research and development and have been personally involved in such work during my time in private industry. Tonight I want to address the key issues of this industry, and in particular the comments that have been made in recent weeks by the Greens and the Democrats seeking to denigrate this industry. The forest industry is one of the largest industries in Australia. It employs about 75,000 people, including the manufacturing side of it, has a turnover of about $10 billion and, as mentioned earlier tonight, imports of about $2.4 billion in 1992-93.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 10 years the industry's growth prospects have been sacrificed by the Labor government in favour of the politics of suburbia in Melbourne and Sydney and by offering arrangements with the anti-development lobby against this industry. The industry is dependent on a large forest estate. The estate consists of about one million hectares of plantation forest&mdash;that forest is increasing by 50,000 hectares per year&mdash;and about seven million hectares of native forest, which are managed on a sustained yield, long rotation basis. The forest estate is not decreasing; in fact, it is increasing in a substantial way via plantations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disappointed to hear the comments made by the Greens and by Senator Coulter. Today, yesterday and last week they were making claims about native forests being destroyed, criticising the woodchip industry and claiming that all native forest wood based industries are subsidised. Given Senator Coulter's science background, I would have thought he would have taken the trouble to obtain the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has been subject to much unsubstantiated criticism over many years. In 1990 Prime Minister Hawke established the Resource Assessment Commission with the aim of seeking out the facts of the matter, including whether the native forests were being abused or not, whether they were well managed and whether they should be used for conservation or multiple use, including wood. Over two years the Resource Assessment Commission took over 500 submissions, produced 33 consultants reports and in 1992 published over 1,500 pages of report. In essence, that report concluded that early this century state governments founded forestry departments or commissions to stop the further clearing of the best of the native forests. The forests had been cleared for agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAC said it could find no evidence to support a cessation of logging of native forests in Australia. The native forests are being managed on a sustained yield basis. It also said that the managed forestry operations in Australia have not been linked to the extinction of a single plant or animal species. Yet the country's `extinction record' is continually proffered as grounds for the industry's closure. Unremitting references to the `ancient' and `pristine' misrepresent the biological resilience of the eucalyptus species and wrongly portrays forests as being a static entity. Pre- and post-European history shows us that we have been subject to constant natural and human disturbance for anything up to 40,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that more than half of the 10 million hectares of forest in parks and conservation areas&mdash;contrast that with the seven million that are available for multiple use, including wood&mdash;were logged in the past is testament to both the resilience of the forests and to the minimal impact of logging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight and on previous occasions Senator Coulter made the erroneous claim that the wood industry based on the native forest is subsidised. Native forests that are owned by the public&mdash;in other words, by the state governments&mdash;are managed for multiple use. This means that they are managed for water, conservation, recreation, fire protection and wood production. Senator Coulter is claiming that the wood is subsidised. However, he is neglecting the cost of managing those forests if they were converted to parks and not used for wood. The facts are that the cost of managing those forests for wood, recreation, conservation of the eco-system and fire protection is very little different on an area basis compared to also including wood production, which at least makes a significant contribution to the economics of running those forests. But to say that the native forests are being subsidised by the community is quite erroneous. In fact, it is the other way around: wood production from the publicly owned native forests of Australia is making a substantial contribution to the general community for managing those public forests for other multiple uses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that Senator Coulter made&mdash;it was also referred to by our Green senators&mdash;related to wastage. Yet at the same time he wanted to criticise the woodchip industry. If we want to run native forests on a sustained yield basis and have them replaced on a sustained yield basis, we have to make use of the material that is there and get rid of it so that a new crop can be established. The woodchip industry has been the saviour of the recovery of the native forests of Australia, which were downgraded late last century and early this century by the sawmilling industry, which attacked those forests and, by selective logging, took out the better trees and gradually downgraded the forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been allotted very little time tonight but wish to make a couple of final points. The Industry Commission's report on this industry is currently before the government. The Industry Commission report pointed out that investment by this industry is expected to be $1.7 billion over the next 10 years if there is no change in policy by the governments. However, if we can agree to a forest policy strategy and security of property rights for the industry, the Industry Commission pointed out that the investment would probably double to over $3 billion during the next 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, I support the research and development aspect. It is very worth while. It will help the smaller firms in the industry achieve international competitiveness, and that is the key for all Australians. I support the bills and commend them to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will create the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. The establishment of this corporation is essential as it will play a major role in helping the forestry industry focus on much needed research and development. Australia imports more than $2.4 billion worth of timber products annually, with exports of only about $775 million. Put another way, we import about four times the value of the forest products we currently export. About 70 per cent of our imports are pulp and paper products. This could only be regarded as unsatisfactory and the sooner a new pulp mill or two is built, the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Continuous interference by lobby groups has caused governments over a long period to make erratic decisions on forestry, creating a massive loss of confidence within the industry. This has had a destabilising effect on the industry, as is evident by the huge trade deficit. Australia should not have a trade deficit in any area of primary production, but it has in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All major investigations into the forestry industry, including the Resource Assessment Commission's 1992 forest and timber inquiry, have highlighted the need for a coordinated, efficient research program. All groups agree that further research is vital to boost productivity and value adding processing in forest and wood product industries. This new corporation will provide a vehicle for a coordinated approach to national research priorities. It will have an industry based framework. It is important that the corporation is run by the industry for the industry, and it will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation will commission, administer and subsequently evaluate research into wood production, extraction, processing, economics and marketing. It will also be sensitive to the environment. Its charter will include the ecological and environmental impacts of disturbance resulting from wood production, silviculture and management of native forests and plantations. Because of Australia's small market and the need for scale, we must find our own way, develop the unique technology and reach unconventional solutions. There must be a strong emphasis on product quality and reliability. Increased value added production in Australia can be potentially realised through domestic market growth, import replacement and increasing exports into growing foreign markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirty years ago the CSIRO had approximately 30 scientists working on timber research and development. The massive cut in CSIRO funds has meant that little or no research and development is now available for the industry. With many manufacturers actively engaged in extensive research into and marketing of alternatives and wood substitutes, timber products are suffering significantly. For the timber industry to keep up with world best practice, this is much needed legislation. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the industry's future must always rely on resource security. I noted what Senator O'Chee said in this regard and I agree with him 100 percent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small companies within the industry are unable to secure their futures because of the short-term supply contracts issued by the government.

I do not intend to go into great detail about what the bills do because I think they have been spelled out quite substantially by other speakers. Very clearly, these are very important measures in so far as the Australian timber industry is concerned. They take a very important step, probably one that is long overdue, with regard to having a capacity for R&amp;D that is primarily paid for by both manufacturers and importers, users of timber et cetera in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a comprehensive package that deals with the national forest policy statement; therefore I do not believe there is a great requirement for it to address every issue, particularly conservation issues outlined in the national forest policy statement. What it will do is provide industry and government with a mechanism to look at the industry from the point of view of developing it in a way that is sustainable and, hopefully, will create further downstream processing and further value adding of this country's forest resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to separate those two points. Downstream processing is somewhat different from value adding. If we are going to further process the timber that we harvest from our forests, then I am sure that it will lead to greater employment. Some of those things have been alluded to by a number of speakers, in particular the Democrats and the Greens who talked about some of the smaller sectors of the industry, and that is an important factor from my point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board that will be set up will have a selection panel. It will be chaired by Megan Cornelius, who is a ministerial appointment, and other members of the panel will be appointed by industry. With regard to its reporting and even its success in the longer term, it is required to report to the parliament and I am quite sure that the government will be very interested in its success, particularly as it relates to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have some difficulty with the way in which this debate has been used by some speakers to talk about other issues. I do not think I could allow those other issues to go unnoticed or not comment on them. Firstly, I would like to pick up the question of resource security. Some opposition senators chose to take the opportunity to blame the government for its inability to bring about resource security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We ought to have a look at who voted on resource security and where they voted. Regardless of whether we believed resource security was the right measure for certain aspects of the industry, the fact was that the government proposed resource security for the industry&mdash;maybe not for all of the industry but certainly for part of it&mdash;and those opposite did not support it. That is why it went down. So there is no point in those opposite coming in here trying to blame the government over an issue which they voted against&mdash;voting with the very people that they have condemned tonight for taking certain points and raising certain issues with respect to matters that are important to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the industry as a whole, quite frankly, I believe that it has a lot of cleaning up to do. We have got a long way to go with regard to how this industry utilises the resources available to it, particularly in the area of employment. In the Asia-Pacific region, it is known that there will be a shortage of timber supplies of large proportions going into the next decade. Therefore, we as a country, and the industry within this country, need to take account of that and make sure that we maximise the opportunities available to us&mdash;both in exports and in the employment that can be generated in the industry&mdash;so that we utilise the timber in the best possible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of inquiries into this industry has been raised. I come from a state that has probably had more inquiries than any other in this country. I have sometimes wondered at the wisdom of the government in having further inquiries, and I have different views on the various inquiries over time. My knowledge of the industry has increased over a long period now and I still feel that the industry needs to lift its game. It has certainly improved, but we still have a long way to go. What really disappoints me today is when I see the misuse of a resource that could generate employment in this country. It is a very important industry in terms of employment. It does have the capacity, above all other resource based industries, to generate employment. We should be vigilant in terms of seeking to maximise those opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard comments from Senator Tambling that integrated forest harvesting was really the only way to go. Rather than debate the point, I merely point out that that is not necessarily the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the introduction of these levies through these bills. It seemed to me as though there was some concept coming from members of the opposition that the government was forcing this upon the industry. In fact, the industry sought this measure&mdash;it wanted it and it will largely be responsible for it. It is wrong of opposition senators to come in here and claim, `Here is the good old government forcing upon industry some costly exercise', when in the main we will be doing the funding on a two for one basis. That ought to be realised by opposition members because it certainly is acknowledged by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter said that the Australian Democrats will withhold their support until the government gets serious about the issues that I assume are important to the Democrats. I wonder what Senator Coulter's view would be if the government and the opposition came in here when a certain aspect relating to conservation arising out of the national forest policy statement was being put in the form of a bill in this place and we said, `Well, we're not happy about that. We're going to hold out until such time as we get our little bit squared off'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts saying that nothing is being done in respect of conservation, that is not true. A process is being put in place between the Commonwealth and the states&mdash;which will probably be finalised by the end of this year&mdash;that will still be able to meet the requirements of the national forest policy statement with respect to the 1995 date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the claims about there being no political will to save Australia's old-growth and native forests, Senator Coulter obviously has not seen or taken note of the efforts of this government with respect to a range of forests around this country. In particular, I can talk of my own state of Tasmania where we have almost 30 per cent of the forests now in reserves. That is not to say there is anything wrong with that process because it is important for us to continue to make sure that we do all the things that are environmentally sound. But it is wrong to come in here and make claims that are not supported by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette raised a question about taxing native forests higher than we would tax plantation forests. These bills are about sustainable development of an industry. It will not bring an end to logging of native or old-growth forests if we do not have these bills. The fact is that the levies arising out of these bills, and in particular those to domestic production, will be on the current production levels. There will not be an increase, and there will not be a decrease as a result of not having these levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted with interest the claim made by Senator Margetts about pulp mills. There is more than ample stock arising out of the harvesting of native forests, and plantation forests for that matter, for the purposes of providing for and meeting the needs of our domestic sawmilling industry&mdash;that is, the residual wood&mdash;to feed three pulp mills in this country. We only have to look at Victoria to see the massive amount of waste that goes on. I find it unfortunate that the conservation movement has opposed strenuously the utilisation of wood that is currently being burnt. Not only would it serve the purpose of getting some further processing of that wood but also it would create an opportunity for more employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point arising out of the bills is that the research and development work that will be conducted will ensure a range of options for this industry. Certainly I, as a government member for whatever time I may be here, will be watching very keenly and trying to ensure that we maximise the opportunities arising out of having such a board in place. I hope that it will add to the further downstream processing of this country's resource. For that reason, I endorse the bills and urge honourable senators to vote for them. </PARA>

Despite all the evidence, there will always be people who want forests to remain intact, untouched and unproductive, but we just cannot go on that way. We have a renewable resource which, if logged properly, can go on for many years. This group of people who do not want any logging is the same group which has no alternative answer as to where income will be generated for towns and communities that depend on a viable timber industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These objections continue to be made, despite all the evidence which shows that Australia needs to increase productivity and value adding&mdash;which just about everyone in this place agrees with generally&mdash;in the forests and wood product industries within a framework of ecological sustainability. I have said in this place many times before that we have to have production and protection going hand-in-hand. We cannot just lock up everything and say that we are not going to have any production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous potential within Australia for expansion of the timber industry, because Australia only supplies two-thirds of its domestic requirements. In other words, we import more than $2.4 billion worth of timber and export only $775 million worth of product. That is unlikely to change in terms of increased domestic production while we have such instability within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking earlier tonight with Senator Gibson about what really is needed. We have to have resource security. People have to be able to log a native forest in a sustainable way. If we put in a plantation we need resource security so that if somebody at some later stage finds a long-footed potoroo on that plantation, logging will not be stopped, which is quite a possibility with the way things are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be real security of investment, just as we need it for mining and agriculture. If we do not have it, how do we get the investment and the people wanting to produce a product that we all use? It is sitting around us here now. We cannot say we cannot log any forests because we would have nothing to sit on because there would be no seats; we would have no roofs over our heads and no houses to live; we would have nothing. We have to have security for the people in the timber industry so that they can go ahead and produce the product which helps us all. We are not going to get investment without that firm direction from the government or a commitment that will protect that investment from the whim of future governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the same token, we have to look after the forests and make sure it is done on a sustainable basis. I have not yet met anyone in the forest industry who has not been a very good conservationist. People in the forest industry are conservationists themselves. We have a renewable resource in the timber industry. If people on the other side want to laugh about it and think that trees do not grow, they should look at how quickly the trees have grown around this Parliament House in just a little while. Trees can grow very quickly and it can be done on a sustainable basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments that the environmentalists put to prevent logging of native forests are made in isolation from world realities. While Australia continues to under supply its own market, imports of timber from endangered forest areas in other countries continue unabated. If we were real conservationists, we would rather use timber from our well managed local native forests than have it come out of other forests around the world. In a national sense we create an imbalance in trade and in a global sense we destroy the environment and that is not sound management of our planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The much used slogan, `Think globally, act locally' has not translated well when it comes to Australia's timber and paper needs. Regarding resource security, the Resource Assessment Commission's inquiry into options for the use of Australia's forest and timber resources concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . security of investment for the wood and wood products industry is essential to the future of a competitive industry. Its preferred approach included provision for compensation.</PARA>
<PARA>It also argued that the benefit to the community from using native forests and plantations could be increased by providing certainty to industry, which I have already discussed, and security of access to resources. On plantations, it argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry found that the extent to which wood from plantations can replace wood from native forests is limited by past rates of planting. Further, unless the community is prepared to accept significant dislocation of regional industry and employment it will not be feasible to accelerate the replacement of native hardwoods with softwood resources.</PARA>
<PARA>We have had that inquiry and that is from the Resource Assessment Commission's annual report 1992-93. That needs to be understood by those who oppose the forest industry. The only alternative is to encourage people to use less timber, and that is hardly appropriate as a stimulus to our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who defend the forest industries acknowledge freely that not always have our native forests been well managed, but like so many other industries in Australia, including farming, we have learnt by our mistakes. The Forest Protection Society acknowledges that freely. Earlier this year, in the introduction to a very good book of that society, its National Director, Robyn Loydell, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Forest Protection Society . . . does not harbour pretences about being a scientific organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>It said later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all know that managed wood production is a form of forest disturbance. Whether it is within the capacity of our forests to cope with such selective disturbance for the benefit of humans is the question which should be the central focus of future debate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps if this central issue had been addressed 20 years ago, much of the pain which has followed many ill-conceived forest closures could have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>The FPS commissioned a study by Dr Peter Attiwill, a quote from which I think is well worth reading out. He quoted from T.C. Whitmore, writing on tropical forests, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (they) are a renewable resource which can be utilized and still retain their diversity and richness for mankind's continuing benefit; but only if we care to learn enough about how they work, and also if, as has been repeatedly stated, utilisation takes place within the limits of the forest's inherent dynamic processes.</PARA>
<PARA>That is really about using a forest to its best ability and using the forests so that the renewable resource can be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Forest Protection Society for the job that it does; I believe that its 9,000-odd members around Australia have really done a lot to make sure the debate in Australia is much more balanced. The annual summer protests that have become almost a standard entertainment in the south-eastern forests for school holiday tourists are as predictable as they are phoney. At the end of the day, they do not increase anyone's knowledge of the forest industry. They cost the industry and they merely exacerbate the combustible situation with loggers who are trying to earn a living in a tough occupation, and who are tired of being provoked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I decided to put my name on the list tonight after hearing a lot of the nonsense that was being spoken by the coalition senators. I think the general thrust of their argument is that forests are only about one thing and that is timber production and let us forget about everything else. Although the Australian Democrats support the principle of value adding, we do not support value adding of logs taken from old-growth forests. Whilst the forestry industry continues to log old-growth forests and wilderness areas the Democrats will not support any measures to enhance value adding where the timbers are obtained from old-growth forests of significance.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Democrats will not condone the further destruction of these forests by supporting the passage of these bills. Senator Coulter, who spoke before me, pointed out that the Commonwealth and the states, except Tasmania, signed the national forest policy at the end of last year. That policy requires state forest agencies to avoid activities that significantly affect old-growth forests and wilderness areas until assessments have been carried out and a reservation system established on public land by 1995. The way we are going in many areas there will be very little, if anything, left by 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states are breaching the national forest policy in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. In Tasmania, logging is continuing apace in both old-growth forests of significance and wilderness areas. The states are obviously flouting the agreement. The Commonwealth government clearly has the responsibility to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first real test of the Commonwealth's integrity on this issue was late last year. A few days after the policy was signed, the then Minister for Resources, Mr Griffiths, gave approval for export woodchipping licences. This decision led to the destruction of significant areas of high conservation value forest. The next test will come up in a few weeks when the new Minister for Resources, Mr Lee, must decide on woodchip export licence conditions for another year. If Mr Lee does not make the right decision, we will once again see major blockades and campaigns in our forests, as already foreshadowed by Senator Brownhill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservation movement will have to resort once again to this course of action, putting themselves in front of bulldozers and putting themselves at great risk.

The 51 coupes occupy some 3,650 hectares&mdash;more than 36 square kilometres. </PARA>

Many opposition senators like to quote certain sections of the Resource Assessment Commission report on the forest industry. I would like to bring to their attention the inquiry's main finding on the logging of old-growth forests&mdash;that is, that the logging of old-growth forests violates the precautionary principle and destroys an irreplaceable resource. The inquiry's preferred option was that logging in old-growth forests cease immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Forestry Commission carries out clear-felling in the south-east forests. One of the most blatant examples of the state government's failure to commit itself to the national forests policy is the controversial decision to commence logging in compartment 1402 in the Nalbaugh State Forest. This area is listed on the National Estate and is part of the Coolangubra wilderness area. Compartment 1402 is home to five endangered animal species.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The destruction of old-growth forests has to stop. The national forest policy requires that states avoid logging in these areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that the Senate desires that senators not speak for long, but I think it would be remiss of me, coming from Tasmania, not to say a few words about this most important piece of legislation. We have had a number of most interesting contributions at the second reading stage. Two Tasmanian senators who are in the chamber at the moment have spoken on the measure. Of course, I certainly do not hold myself out to have the breadth and depth of knowledge about this industry that Senators Gibson and Murphy do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to raise with the Senate a couple of questions arising from the last speaker's contribution. Senator Lees appeared to indicate that the Australian Democrats would not support this legislation until there was some clear manifestation that the authorities&mdash;the industry and the governments&mdash;intended to ensure that certain things occurred. The measures before us are simply to provide the finance for the corporation, which has already been established. It is not immediately clear to me how voting against this piece of legislation will achieve the results which Senator Lees and Senator Coulter have suggested should be achieved prior to this measure being passed by this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act, regulations have already been made to establish the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation. So the organisation has been established and a charter and function have been given to that organisation. What it lacks, of course, is money. These measures are to levy that money so that that organisation can pursue the very important task of research. It seems to me that, as I think has been said before in this debate, that research will do much to ensure that there are alternative measures to those which are condemned&mdash;broadly, I think, by everybody in the Senate and by many people outside the Senate&mdash;and which frequently have been condoned in previous years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of old-growth forests, I think there is a great deal to be done in determining a better system of operation for plantation forests&mdash;for example, better species and more effective collaboration between the processing industries and the production industry so that there is more focus on the plantation industries. Of course, new ideas take time. The corporation is required to come up with five-year plans, including objectives, strategies and policies, and to prepare annual operating plans for each financial year. We in the parliament will have access to those. They will be brought to the parliament and there will be plenty of opportunities to debate them. So the corporation's activities will be the subject of constant debate and consideration by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said, rarely has an industry had more investigations and more interest from the parliament than this industry. A spin-off of the research-driven activities of the corporation could be that we will be able to provide the information and the results of our research to other countries. In a global context, that is important, from the conservationists' point of view. If, through moneys which are proposed in this bill, through the corporation and through the activities of those organisations to which the moneys are disbursed by the corporation, we can develop species and techniques that will work in this country and can work in some of the other countries, then we may be able to save some of the old-growth forests in other countries, which we are all concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to labour this issue, but I want to make a point. As the Senate knows, I am very interested in the budget for the official development assistance programs that Australia funds through AIDAB. One of the things that I believe we are significantly lacking in this area is the provision of expertise to other countries in respect of the timber industry. I think we have the expertise in this country. This will give a boost to that expertise. I think that it will be a good thing not only for Australia but also for a number of other countries&mdash;and, incidentally, for the conservation movement throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I intend to support this bill. I note for the record what was said in the second reading speech to these bills:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Already the Commonwealth provides significant support to forest industry research and development in several ways: through direct funding to CSIRO Divisions of Forestry, Forest Products, and Wildlife and Ecology; to the Cooperative Research Centres for Temperate Hardwood Forestry and Hardwood Fibre and Paper Science; and through such programs as the national pulp mill research program and the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation's agroforestry program. Research into forestry and forest products is also supported by the state governments and the forest industry.</PARA>

We had some significant contributions. I accept that the Greens and the Democrats have a perspective of forestry that is different from that of some of us.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with a piece of legislation that, under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989&mdash;forestry is, in a significant sense, a primary industry&mdash;provides for a levy to be collected by a research and development corporation. This will be set up as a body corporate with day-to-day autonomy&mdash;I stress that, because it is important in the context of what it will conduct research into&mdash;and flexibility to operate in a similar manner to that of many other commercial organisations, including the numerous commercial primary industry organisations that are not dictated to by government or, indeed, the particular sector of the industry they represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the corporation will be to provide a national strategic leadership to industry research and development and to act as a catalyst to stimulate research and development within the forest industries.

Senator Gibson, Senator Harradine and my colleague Senator Murphy, who has been much more closely involved with this industry than most others, realise the importance of this industry to Australia; the importance of having an effective research and development program, not just to serve the purposes of those people involved in forest industries but also to ensure that we have a forest industry that is environmentally sustainable, that is taking into account the legitimate environmental concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have any amendments but I have some questions I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary. The first question I would like to ask him is in relation to forestry. Does he believe that there should be full cost recovery; in other words, that the absolutely enormous subsidies which I mentioned in my speech that have gone into forestry since the 1920s&mdash;something over $4 billion or $5 billion over that time&mdash;should disappear and that the full costs of taking trees out of the forest should be recovered?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government is talking market forces; certainly the opposition is talking market forces. Specifically, does he believe that there should be complete internalisation of all the externalities in relation to logging forests, recognising that there are costs in the loss of forests which go beyond simply the value of the wood&mdash;we have alluded to many of those tonight&mdash;and that those costs also need to be incorporated into the costs which are charged against the forestry industry?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coulter for his question. Full cost recovery is a desirable long-term objective. Senator Coulter has probably read the national forest policy statement. It is a desirable long-term objective that we maximise cost recovery in the forest industry, recognising that, whatever our particular attitude is to the responsibility of state and federal governments, a very significant responsibility lies in the hands of the states in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 20 of the national forest policy statement on the issue of wood pricing and allocation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prices will be market based, at least cover the full cost of efficient management (including regeneration) attributable to wood production, include a fair return on capital, and provide an adequate return to the community from the use of a public resource.</PARA>
<PARA>A sensible approach to that is that obviously it will not occur tomorrow. The forest industry involves a very complex set of interrelationships in both the harvesting of forest products and their processing in a variety of forms. It will take some years to achieve, but that is our overall policy objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees referred to a conference on water policy in Australia, which I had the pleasure of opening on Monday. Every major policy initiative of this government in the environmental, primary industry and resources areas is focused on taking into account the real costs of recovery and production in these resource sectors. It is a complex issue and not one that we can resolve easily tomorrow. It has to take into account a reasonable time frame and the relative balance in political responsibilities between state and central governments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) for that answer because it provided two bits of information. Firstly, it answered Senator Harradine's query about the relevance of the Democrats' objection to this legislation. I notice that the reply went immediately to the national forest policy and I can tell Senator Harradine that that is what we are concerned about&mdash;that the government is implementing part of the national forest policy but not other parts which we believe to be even more important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important thing which the parliamentary secretary has just said is that the government will continue to subsidise forestry in Australia. I want to make it absolutely clear&mdash;and get it on the record so that everybody understands it&mdash;that this federal government will be putting money into value adding to forestry products but at the same time will continue to subsidise the destruction of our old-growth forests for an indefinite period. That is what the parliamentary secretary has said and it is now clearly on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would like Senator Sherry to deal with is a concern that has been expressed to me, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania. Many craft workers in those states have found themselves locked out of mixed old-growth forests where they wish to go and take what are known as the minority species, many of which often make extremely high quality, very expensive furniture and pieces of timber. They have been locked out of those areas when those areas have been clear-felled on the grounds that it is simply easier for those who are clear-felling and chipping an area to do that and not worry about craftspeople coming in and selectively taking out those trees which have a very high value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has seen in factories in the south-west of Western Australia and in Tasmania&mdash;indeed, in Hobart&mdash;pieces of furniture priced at thousands of dollars made from these minority species and the people making this furniture complaining that they have great difficulty getting access to the wood. If this bill is about value adding, surely there should be some assurance from this government&mdash;because this government is passing the legislation&mdash;that that will not continue and that those people who are making these high quality pieces of furniture and other timber products out of these minority species will continue to have access to them in these areas that will continue to be harvested. I would also like some assurance of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Coulter has gone a good way beyond the subject matter of this legislation. I have been to the furniture design centre in Hobart and, together with a number of Tasmanian representatives and senators, I have been actively involved in lobbying to ensure that that design centre continues to receive funding to actively involve itself&mdash;it is not the only organisation in Tasmania, I might add&mdash;in important value adding issues, such as furniture design.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a limited resource because, both within the national forest policy statement&mdash;and I know Tasmania is not yet a party to it as yet&mdash;and the various environmental guidelines that apply to forestry in Tasmania, there is a limit on the resource.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted Senator Coulter's analysis of the speeches this afternoon and I am not criticising him for that, but we should draw the committee's attention to the important fact that forestry is one of the major regional industries in Australia. There is a $10 billion turnover in forestry, largely in rural and regional Australia. It is a very important industry. Whilst I accept that the sort of issues Senator Coulter is raising have a legitimate connection to this legislation, they are not the central and core issues. The central and core issue is a research and development structure providing for funding to overcome some of the very issues he complains about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that Senator Sherry is evidently not aware that, although these minority species are in limited supply, what I know has happened in Western Australia and Tasmania&mdash;and it may well have happened in other states&mdash;is that individual craftspeople have been denied access to those trees in forest areas which have been clear-felled. They have not been allowed to go in and specifically take out those trees, even knowing that all those trees will be felled and sent off to the chippers. This legislation is partly about a levy to get value adding into forestry industries&mdash;something we said that we agree with. But Senator Sherry is evidently not aware that that has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue I raise with Senator Sherry is that of the efficient use of forest timber. It is estimated that roughly 30 per cent of the available timber in clear-felled areas is left on the forest floor instead of going off to the chippers. Daishowa has mobile chippers which it could send into the forest; they could chip branches and take everything down to the mill. That is not done quite simply because the timber carters for Daishowa are contractors who are paid for the weight of timber that they transport. It is more convenient for them to simply take the logs and leave all the large branches and everything else as trash on the forest floor, very often to be burnt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many other countries, such as Sweden, the whole tree is used. We could substantially reduce the area of forest which we clear if we used the whole tree, particularly in those cases in which we are going to chip. I have been around long enough to know that when the woodchip industry got under way it undertook to government that it was going to use only the waste material; it was not going to use the primary logs at all. What, if anything, does this government intend to do to increase the efficiency with which the timber that is felled in the forest is used? Is it going to try to see that 100 per cent of the tree is used, not only 70 per cent as happens at present?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With due respect to Senator Coulter, the issue he is raising, whilst being important, is not a central issue to this legislation. To respond to his question, the basic tenet of the principles that are enunciated in the national forest policy statement is that there will be an allocation system for timber that will be flexible and will involve competitive bidding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter made a broad brush, emotive statement that timber is being sent off to the chippers which should be used for the sorts of value adding that he highlights. He mentioned the craftspeople; I have seen many of the good works they do. I concede that occasionally a log might get through which should not go to the chipper. But, by and large, the practices of the forestry commissions&mdash;not just in Tasmania, but also the other forestry departments&mdash;ensure that those poor quality logs and those poor quality sectors of the log which are left over after use for sawlogging are consigned to a lower value adding area of the industry. Overwhelmingly, that is the practice in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter referred earlier to a system based on cost recovery and a rational use of pricing policies. That is a central element of the forest policy statement. That will enable the entry of new processors and will allow the small operators to which he refers to compete in those niche markets. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My final question relates to the last part of the closing speech at the second reading stage in which reference was made to the amount of forest product which Australia imports each year. I think it was mentioned that the trade imbalance was $1.6 billion. I think Senator Sherry also mentioned that if we turned some of the chips which we now export&mdash;very low value adding chips&mdash;into paper and value added product, we could turn that situation around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding was that when Harris Daishowa&mdash;as it was when it first began&mdash;was given its first licences, it undertook to build a pulp mill in Australia. That has not happened. It is still exporting chips. These licences are coming up for renewal. What is the government going to do in relation to that undertaking? As I understand it, that was a clear undertaking to value add to those chips. It has not occurred over many years. What is the government going to do? Is it going to hold Daishowa to that promise?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be perfectly blunt, I think Senator Coulter is trying to have it both ways. The fundamental question is: will we be allowed to build a pulp mill, to value add with those chips we export? Senator Coulter wants to have it both ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will get as angry as I ever have in this Senate. I have been through this debate in the Tasmanian context. Really, I think Senator Coulter has a gall to request that this government value add by processing the chips we export and impose that as a licence condition on the current evaluation of exporting of chips. I would be very happy to go to my minister and say that we will do that, provided that Senator Coulter will give me an undertaking&mdash;which I know he will not give&mdash;and provided that the Greens will give me an undertaking that they will support the number of pulp and paper mills that would eventuate as a consequence of that policy. There would probably be two or three of them. I would love to see an environmentally responsible pulp and paper industry develop in Australia based on that chip export industry that we have at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great tragedies of this forest industry debate in Australia is that we seem to be locked into particular positions where there cannot be a reasonable outcome on this issue. As I said earlier in my speech, we are a net importer of forest products in Australia when we should be a net exporter. One dollar in every $10 of our total debt is incurred as a consequence of the particular difficulty we are locked into. That is a shame and it is a regrettable reflection of the relative immaturity with which we approach the debate on forest issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not lay all the blame at the feet of the environmentalists. The approach of some of the developments that are being proposed in the handling of some of the environmental issues&mdash;not purely the public relations issue&mdash;has been a little naive. It is a sad reflection on the country and it is a cost that we are all paying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just smooth Senator Sherry down; I would not like to see him go away angry. He will not have an argument with me about building an appropriate pulp mill or going on and making paper. Where he will have an argument is in relation to the methods which are used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of South Australia, the pulp mill used processes of digesting the lignocellulose and bleaching, which were very destructive, and we have enormous problems with Lake Bonney. Over many years, the company concerned said that there were no other methods of bleaching or digestion which could be used. They are now increasingly shifting to those newer and environmentally cleaner methods of carrying out that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been strongly promoting the use of alternative fibres in paper making for many years: low THC hemp in the southern parts, possibly flax, and kenaf in the northern parts of Australia. We should be making more of our own paper. These alternative fibres have the advantage of having much less lignin, requiring much less digestion and, therefore, being much less environmentally damaging. This also, incidentally, is providing the Queensland canegrowers with a very viable alternative crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has spent an enormous amount of money&mdash;10 years of research work through CSIRO&mdash;on doing the work on kenaf. It is now being used in the States. The Dutch have taken up the hemp work and they are producing paper in Holland. We should be doing these things. I strongly supported those measures. So Senator Sherry certainly will not find any argument with me over increasing our production of paper and products of that sort, provided the processes are environmentally sensible and sane. I do not think that those processes have been carried out in that way in the past. That is my only argument there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The CSL Sale Bill 1993 is concerned with the privatisation of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. It provides a framework for the sale of that organisation. I will not go into the detail. The organisation was established in 1916. It is Australia's only manufacturer of human vaccines and is one of only two manufacturers in Australia of biological veterinary products. It has been and is an Australian success story.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial reports for last financial year had revenue at $171 million, which is up 8 per cent, and a net profit of $13.8 million. Its net assets from the previous year's balance sheet&mdash;last year's balance sheet has not been released yet&mdash;were $163 million. The balance sheet is in a healthy condition. CSL has 1,100 employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a successful research oriented company. It spent $19 million last year on research and development. CSL's main laboratory is in Parkville at Melbourne's Medical Research Centre. CSL has invested $40 million in a new plasma products facility at Broadmeadows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, CSL is an Australian success story. In 1961 CSL became a statutory authority and it was then that it basically became more profit oriented. In 1990 it was made into a public company via the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Conversion into Public Company) Act. At that time the coalition argued for the immediate privatisation of the organisation. We are pleased to see that at long last the government is going to privatise 100 per cent of this company. The bill provides for various conditions in the articles of association prior to privatisation. I will not go into the details of those conditions at this late hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very significant thing that the Senate should be aware of is the possibility of a significant contingent liability by the company. With the sale of the company, as set out in this bill, the Commonwealth's contingent liability for claims against the company ceases. There are some existing claims and the possibility of future claims which relate to three areas: firstly, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is linked with a drug made by CSL in the past; secondly, AIDS and hepatitis which is concerned with blood products from some time ago; and, thirdly, the pertussis vaccine which is a component of triple antigen. We believe that the government must continue to indemnify the company against claims for past actions by CSL. We understand that the government has given such an undertaking to CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate in the other place the coalition moved an amendment to the legislation. We also moved an amendment concerning employee share ownership. Those opposite are probably expecting us to move a similar amendment in the Senate. However, there are three reasons why we are not doing so this evening. Firstly, in the debate in the other place after the coalition moved an amendment, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Health to Dr McNamee, the Managing Director of CSL. The letter stated that the asset sales task force:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will recommend to the Minister that the Commonwealth provides an indemnity for any loss suffered by CSL arising from certain claims brought against the Company by any person as a result of the use of the following products:</PARA>
<PARA>The letter then lists the various products&mdash;A, B, C, D and E. This covers the matters I referred to before. The coalition expects the government to accept this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason we have not moved an amendment&mdash;and I think it is much more important than the first&mdash;concerns the directors of CSL. They are currently going through the process of due diligence. They have to produce a prospectus for the sale of the company and they must sign that prospectus, thereby accepting personal liability for what is contained therein. Obviously, they would be mad to sign such a document unless they get a clear and unequivocal undertaking from the government to indemnify CSL and the directors against current and future claims arising from past activities. Given that situation, the coalition is persuaded that these matters are being addressed properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason for not moving an amendment to this bill concerns the employee share ownership. The coalition is very strongly in favour of encouraging employees to take up shares in all enterprises. I have been advised that the board of the company is currently examining in detail options for a proper employee share ownership scheme for the employees of CSL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this place before, with regard to another enterprise, that a proper employee share ownership scheme is the appropriate way to go because it means that the company can finance employees into shares in the company rather than being involved in an external way through the float. The coalition strongly supports such a move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has consistently initiated and led the debate in this parliament on the need for privatisation of government enterprises. All around the world governments have realised that there is no need for them to own business enterprises. Businesses work much more efficiently in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent publication from New Zealand entitled `The public benefit of private ownership. The case for privatisation.', published in June last by the New Zealand business round table, listed seven gains to be achieved by privatisation: firstly, clear objectives with more effective monitoring and accountability mechanisms; secondly, a greater consumer focus and an increased or improved range of products and services; thirdly, increased productivity with the same or fewer staff; fourthly, cost reductions and hence lower prices, which is good for all consumers; fifthly, improved remuneration structures for the people within the organisation which enhances the ability to attract and hold the appropriate staff with the right skills; sixthly, vastly improved profits; and, finally, more effective management information systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst corporatisation&mdash;that is, the changing of government business enterprises into the structure of private companies but still being owned by a government&mdash;can lead to very substantial gains, moves to full privatisation give by far the best results. It is interesting to note that both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund independently, in recent reports, cited the New Zealand experience as a good example for other countries to follow. The IMF report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the case of New Zealand is particularly instructive for other countries contemplating a privatisation programme.</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia in recent years privatisation sales by both Commonwealth and state governments have amounted to only $6 billion. Over the two years to June 1992 the total value of assets of state and Commonwealth government owned businesses increased by $25 billion to $126 billion. There are a lot of government businesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The slow pace in Australia should be compared with what happened in New Zealand. Over a period of only a few years its total sales of business enterprises were $US11 billion. That is for an economy which is smaller than the economy of Victoria. The coalition urges the government to speed up the privatisation process. We welcome the privatisation of CSL. We wish its board, management and all of its employees success. I commend this bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not surprise honourable senators in the chamber to realise that we will oppose the CSL Sale Bill 1993. What we got from the government in its second reading speech and what we have just heard from Senator Gibson is the blind ideological view that private is good and public is bad. That simply does not hold. Indeed, there is abundant evidence in the second reading speech of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) which bears this out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention a few of the facts contained in that speech. It mentions that CSL was established in 1916. It waxes lyrical about the benefits which Australia has derived from CSL over the years as a government enterprise. We were one of the very first nations in the world to have uniform immunisation of children against diphtheria. I think it was 10 or 15 years before Britain did the same thing. CSL is a very good organisation and served the interests of the Australian public extremely well. In view of Senator Gibson's statement about consumer focus, I do not think anything could be said against the consumer focus which CSL has exhibited over many years. It has been a very broad focus but I will come back to that point in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech mentions that the company's assets are valued at $238 million and last year sales exceeded $160 million. It would seem to me, by any reasonable comparison, that a company&mdash;government or otherwise&mdash;is doing very well to turn over $160 million worth of sales with assets of $238 million in a single year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech also mentions that last year CSL invested $18 million in research and development. That is 11 per cent of sales. Later I want the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), who will be replying to the debate, to tell me which other private company in Australia, if any, has spent as much as 11 per cent of its total sales in a year on research and development. Governments&mdash;indeed, I think, most parties&mdash;in Australia have been complaining that a disproportionate amount of our research and development is carried out by governments. Over many decades we have had great difficulty in getting private companies to invest heavily in R&amp;D. This government has invoked many proposals and put many policies in place to try to encourage private companies to invest in R&amp;D. The minister's second reading speech says that last year 11 per cent of total turnover went back into R&amp;D. I would like the minister to tell me what other private companies would meet that sort of objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech also contains quite unbelievable statements. It talks about the aggregate limit of shareholding in the privatised CSL being 15 to 20 per cent foreign ownership. Given the events of the last couple of days, the rather perfunctory consideration given to increasing foreign ownership and decisions being made virtually on the run by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), one finds it very difficult to accept that any statement like that has any worth whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech also talks very euphemistically about increasing the return to the taxpayers, yet the sale is to be exempted from state and territory taxes and fees. One wonders exactly how that can be when CSL, which is currently totally owned by all the taxpayers of Australia&mdash;a point that we have made in relation to privatising the banks and just about everything else that is saleable in this country&mdash;suddenly becomes owned by only a small fraction of all the taxpayers and those who own it are exempted from state and territory taxes and fees. So much for what is contained in the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the primary concerns that the Democrats have is that CSL has made a range of products over a very long time. Some of those products, which have been absolutely critical in terms of the lifesaving properties of the agents developed, are not at all profitable. In any one year in this country there are not large numbers of people bitten by particular snakes or by hopper ants or stung by bees, and not many people have anaphylactic reactions. The sale of products to treat those particular people will not make much profit at all. CSL has carried those on at a loss. They are very important to the people who happen to be bitten by those snakes or who are allergic to bee stings, hopper ant stings, sea wasps, box jellyfish, cone shells and a whole range of other things that CSL has worked on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One cannot believe for a moment that a private company that is now driven by profit rather than by the public interest will continue to have any interest in the manufacture of those things at all. Only a few moments ago Senator Gibson identified one of the principal advantages of privatising CSL, saying that it would increase profits. If it will increase profits, it seems to me that it will do it at the expense, as just about every other pharmaceutical company does, of not making those products which might be absolutely vital lifesaving products for a very small number of people in any one year, but of concentrating rather on the manufacture of those products which are used in large amounts by the largest number of people but which may be quite trivial in terms of health or even lifesaving. It is far more profitable to make and strongly promote a slightly more soluble form of aspirin than it is to make an antivenene for a rare snake bite in Australia. A company that is driven by profits is likely to go down the former road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of some of the developments which were carried on in the Department of Microbiology in my former university, the University of Adelaide. At the end of the development of some of these vaccines the department was unable to carry on with the work; it wanted to sell the research work to private interests. Because the products could be produced so cheaply and were of principal concern in Third World countries, the private companies were simply not interested in taking them up. The sort of statement that was made was, `Yes, we can sell that product for 15c a shot in Third World countries but we are not interested; we would rather sell it for $15 in first world countries'. There is where the profit lies. That is the basic concern that the Democrats have about the privatisation of this organisation. There are a number of products which CSL either makes or is researching which are very likely to fall in this category. One of the principal researchers in this area pointed out in a paper from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia </EMPHASIS>in 1992 that few doubt that the sale to private investors will lead to the demise of these products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other functions which CSL has played&mdash;it has been a private company&mdash;is that its experts have been available for advice around Australia for medical consultation purposes. Most general practitioners would very rarely deal with such things as snake and spider bites and require assistance in diagnosing the cause of the illness and the proper course of treatment. CSL has provided such a service over many years. Even supposing that this work continues, a profit driven organisation is unlikely to provide those sorts of services without considerable fees, and therefore those services are not likely to be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSL is the only antivenom manufacturer in the world that has consistently followed the performance of antivenoms and locked this information into procedures for better patient care. So it has not only been a pharmaceutical manufacturer of antivenenes; it has also followed out into the field the effectiveness of these antivenenes and has fed that back into better procedures in relation to patient care and continually improved its products. There are quite a number of products which fall into that general category which CSL has worked on and which, under a scheme of privatisation, I think would be very likely to fall by the wayside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until now people in Australia have not been paid to donate blood&mdash;they have given blood quite willingly and without payment, unlike in America and many other countries&mdash;and the blood which has gone beyond its expiry time has been passed on to CSL for preparation of various human blood fractions. Under the new arrangements the Red Cross will actually be paid a fee for blood which in fact has been donated to the Red Cross free of charge. Again, one wonders whether we are not starting on the slippery road, on which the large number of people who are unemployed may then be led down the path, as many in America and other than places are led, to donate blood and so on as a way of simply keeping themselves alive. I do not think we should be mixing up the issue of profitability with essential medical services in that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a profound comment, and I missed it. We need to judge each case on its merits. There are circumstances in which things should be sold by the Commonwealth and circumstances in which they should be retained or developed by government. That is an issue to be judged in each circumstance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The concern that persuaded the government on the balance, at least as I am advised&mdash;it was a decision taken earlier than when I was a minister, but I was a member of the caucus&mdash;was the position the Commonwealth found itself in as owner, customer and regulator of the same company. I think there are some inherent problems in that and it was an issue that needed to be addressed. Nobody would deny that the sale of an asset always has certain budget bottom line benefits, but we are not now talking here about the Commonwealth Bank or Qantas putting $2 billion or $3 billion or $4 billion into the budget; we are talking about a much more modest amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government took the decision in the 1993 budget to sell all of its shares in CSL and the intention is, with the passage of this legislation, that the flotation will occur in the second half of this financial year, although always, when we talk about floats, they are dependent upon market conditions and, of course, the progress of the sale preparations. But it is still the expectation on that timetable that the revenue will flow into this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a share allocation strategy. It is outlined in the second reading speech. I would waste the Senate's time if I were to go over it in full. Its purpose is to achieve a broad spread of shareholdings at the time of the float, to limit voting rights of foreign shareholders, to require&mdash;the list goes on. Further than the question of the spread of shareholdings, it goes to the control of the organisation to require CSL's head office and principal fractionation activities to be located in Australia, that it remain incorporated in Australia and that the chair and the board remain predominantly Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill covers, I think, all the legislative changes necessary to enable the float of CSL to be finalised. It contains the necessary  provisions to protect the rights of the employees. In listening to the speeches, I do not think anybody challenged that the legislative framework is a sound one to enable the public offering of the Commonwealth shareholding in CSL to proceed. I suppose that is not surprising. It is fundamentally the same approach that has been taken with regard to similar matters that the Commonwealth has undertaken, with certain special provisions in here to deal with the circumstances of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, but the standard formula applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the issue of employee share ownership that Senator Gibson raised&mdash;not to disagree with what he said, because I support share ownership schemes and have advocated them for some time. But the appropriate course of action is what is being undertaken in the process of this sale. My advice is that the board of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has agreed in principle to an employee share ownership scheme. Options are being developed and it is intended that the scheme that develops will comply with the standard DIR guidelines with regard to this matter. The Commonwealth will be seeking to ensure there is an equitable allocation and that the scheme is funded by CSL. So I think that matter is adequately dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know the answer to that. It would seem to me to be an extraordinary proposition. I would have thought that normally there would be a problem for directors who did not attend meetings because company directors have certain obligations which they undertake in accordance with the securities legislation. It would not be in the legislation; it would be in the articles of association of the company. I do not know what that sets down with regard to quorums.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the difficulties in this area, as Senator McMullan will know&mdash;it is particularly true in the pharmaceutical area, to the extent that the government has actually put in place certain incentives for research in Australia&mdash;is that companies that are either foreign owned or linked with foreign companies tend to carry out their research elsewhere. What has happened very often with Australian research, particularly in the medical area, is that the primary research&mdash;which is usually substantially done at public expense&mdash;is then taken by these companies and the actual development processes are carried on overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I accept that there are protections written into this legislation, I certainly would not like to see us continuing to have some of the expensive end of the research work while we lose the ability of CSL to take on some of that research work&mdash;work which might be carried out in universities, medical schools, CSIRO or any of the medical research institutes around the country, and which is often a very expensive part of the whole process&mdash;and then have it taken off overseas and developed somewhere else. Over the years we have lost far too many of our good ideas to overseas companies. This is particularly true&mdash;and the government, as I say, has recognised this&mdash;in the pharmaceutical area. So that is my reason for asking that question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These bills propose a number of amendments to 16 acts within the transport and communications portfolio. There are a number of technical amendments and some new arrangements for policy delivery. Included in the bills are amendments to the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his One Nation statement in February 1992, the Prime Minister announced that funds would be set aside for a significant upgrading of the inter-capital rail network. This project was conditional upon the Commonwealth receiving appropriate recognition of these funds as equity in the National Rail Corporation Limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the amendment, the Commonwealth will be entitled to shares in National Rail equivalent to the value of payments made in respect of certain nominated railway projects. The amendments allow for the shareholders to issue shares to the Commonwealth, should they agree to do so. The amendments will also allow funds to be used in capital contributions as well as for the payment of grants. The effect of this amendment will be to allow the Commonwealth to have equity recognition but only with the agreement of shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is more than a pity that the government has taken so long&mdash;more than 18 months since it was first announced in the One Nation statement&mdash;to provide for these new funding arrangements in rail development. The grand commitment to improving Australia's rail system and creating jobs has been bogged down in government ineptitude and hidden agendas, as its so-called job creation strategy sought to retrench more people in the rail industry&mdash;and that is particularly true in my own state of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also amendments to the National Railways Commission Act to increase the penalty provisions for anyone who recklessly endangers a train. It is also proposed to extend the powers of inquiry into rail safety incidents. It is to be hoped that these measures are a sign that the government is truly committed&mdash;truly committed, not as it has been over all the years since it came in in 1983&mdash;to improving rail services and safety in an effort to encourage greater use of what is potentially a very cost-effective and environmentally conservative form of transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides for amendments to the Civil Aviation Act and the Air Navigation Act. The former enables the CAA to more effectively regulate foreign registered aircraft which are employed in domestic commercial operations. In order to ensure that Australia's laudable air safety record is maintained, I hope that the CAA is more diligent in this area than it has shown itself to be in relation to the new air space rules which fell on their face only a few weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final area of this legislation I wish to address is the amendments to the Navigation Act of 1912. The legislation provides for the making of regulations relating to the qualifications, training, standard of competence</PARA>
<PARA>and licensing of marine pilots in the Australian coastal area. This, of course, is a matter which has received a considerable amount of attention in relation to the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been recent reports in the media and discussions in this place about the disgraceful state of ships traversing Australian waters and the often compete lack of training and experience of the crews who man them. Indeed, I think Senator Margetts today moved a motion with respect to that. Thus far, it would seem that it is only divine intervention that has prevented a serious environmental disaster and loss of life. It is the case that significant areas of the Australian coastline and the channels north between Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands have been only partially mapped, making the task of marine pilots traversing these waters even more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If shipping is to fulfil its task of transporting Australian product to the world, it is imperative that ships which travel our waters be conducted safely, guided by pilots with a high standard of training and competence. The amendments proposed are a small step in the right direction. The minister will be pleased to know that the Australian Democrats will be supporting this bill.</PARA>

Under the amendment bill concerning national road transport the Commonwealth will release shares in recognition of each state's contribution.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few things about the failure today of the Senate to accept the coalition's motion to refer to the relevant Senate estimates committee the consideration of the government's handling&mdash;and, in particular, the actions of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Kelly&mdash;of the allocation of grants to sporting associations in Australia in what was, quite obviously, one of the most blatant pork-barrelling attempts to bribe the electorate, particularly in marginal electorates, prior to the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the House of Representatives, Mrs Kelly attacked the messenger, namely, the Auditor-General, for the problems that seem to have arisen for her in this area. She should be open and honest for a change. She should be prepared to defend her decisions with respect to these grants and to make available to both chambers of this parliament the background material to support and justify the grants that she has made. Obviously, she is not going to do that. It will be dragged out of her like pulling teeth. The only implication that one can draw from that is that her reluctance is due to the fact that those grants have been made for the most blatant political reasons. They were not based on the needs of the organisations concerned but on the then desperate political needs of the Labor Party to try to bribe its way back into government at the election earlier this year using taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This course of action has become all too common in this country in the last 10 years. We now have a government which seems unable to differentiate between the national interest and the interest of its own party political base. In most other countries that is what is known as political corruption. There is no less a reason for calling it that in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I want to read into the record some of the grants and the implications of those grants for my own state of Victoria. What the Auditor-General found in his analysis, as we saw in his report which was tabled last week, was that on average throughout Australia seats held by the Labor Party received twice as much funding in the form of cultural and sporting grants as those held by the coalition. In my own state of Victoria the average grant was $57,000. The average grant to each electorate was $211,000 and the average number of grants per electorate was 3.7. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the Labor Party held only 37 per cent of the total number of federal House of Representatives seats for Victoria prior to the last election, Labor electorates received half the total value of the grants and 55 per cent of the number of the grants. It is not just the dollar amounts of the grants in terms of the total per electorate that are important; the number of such grants is also very important. Of course, that will vary according to the size of the electorate, but a lot of smaller grants scattered throughout an electorate can be an enormous political bribe. That is what happened in many of the seats in Victoria in the months leading up to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distribution of grants is even more interesting. In my own state of Victoria, only four safe Labor electorates received less than the average value, 16 coalition electorates received less than the average value, and only four coalition held seats received more than three grants. It is in respect of grants distribution that Mrs Kelly's documents should be made public for scrutiny. These are some of the essential figures for which she has not been prepared to provide the information as to the basis for her decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the marginal seats held by Labor in Victoria. The seat of Melbourne Ports received five grants, with a total of $555,000. Jagajaga received the equivalent of 5 1/2 grants, with a total of $250,000. Hotham, the then marginal seat held by Simon Crean, the aspirant for the leadership if Paul Keating does not pull his socks up&mdash;and Simon Crean is hot on his heels&mdash;received six grants, with a total of $398,000. The seat that Gordon Scholes was vacating, the seat of Corio, received eight grants, with a total of $472,000. Corio was a relatively marginal seat, particularly with Mr Scholes retiring, and it was one that the Liberal Party had hoped to have a very good run in. I know it was regarded by Labor as a difficult seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seat of Holt received 4 1/2 grants, with a total of $252,000. As I said, the average grant to an electorate in Victoria was $211,000, so all the ones that I have mentioned to date have been well above average. Holt was no exception. The seat of Burke, held by Neil O'Keefe on a marginal basis prior to the last election, received a record for Victoria of 10 separate grants, to be scattered like confetti around the electorate at a cost to taxpayers of $259,000. All of those were well above average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now look at the seats that were held marginally by the Liberal Party&mdash;seats that Labor desperately needed to win at the election. The seat of Corinella had received 4 1/2 grants, with a total of $448,000. The seat of Bendigo received five grants, at a total cost outlay to taxpayers of $414,000. The seat of McEwen received 7 1/2 grants, at a total outlay of $260,000. The seat of Ballarat received only two grants, but one of them was an enormous grant of a quarter of a million dollars. The total for the two grants was $262,000. As I say, all of those are also well above the average distribution, in dollar terms, of grants throughout my state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of that funding obviously raises very serious questions about the minister's propriety in this affair. I will not go over that again tonight. We will hear a lot more of it in the future, as we have heard in the last couple of days. We have a situation in which taxpayer funded programs are being used, in effect, as Labor slush funds for buying votes in the most blatant political way. I think that, as the information about these grants and others comes to be more widely known throughout the community, the community will see these grants for what they are. We cannot describe them in any other way than as a blatant bribe and a blatant misuse of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not by any means the first area in which this government has employed that same program. In my own portfolio area we have seen it par excellence in terms of grants to ethnic communities. Last year there were 111 ethnic community grants made in Victoria. Of those, something like 38 were made within the central city area of Melbourne&mdash;at least, that is where the headquarters of the organisations were based. If we exclude those, there were 73 grants made to other electorates. Of those, only 12 1/2 grants were made to coalition held seats. We should bear in mind that prior to the last election the coalition held something like 60-plus per cent of the total seats. So we had 60-plus per cent of the total seats and 12 1/2  of the 73 grants made to coalition held seats. Those 12 1/2 grants were worth only $533,695&mdash;only 11.5 per cent of the total grants made in Victoria to ethnic communities last year of $4.65 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one will forget the scandalous situation immediately prior to the 1990 election in which the cabinet decided, I think just two days before the 1990 election, on an additional $5 million of grants to ethnic community associations. Again, the distribution of that, which was kept secret until months after the election, was made in the most blatant vote buying&mdash;vote rigging, one could say&mdash;way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and the Italian electorate has in many ways voted accordingly. So we have had the situation now with cultural and sporting grants, with the ethnic community grants and with the local capital works program which, before the last election, was one of the supposed key capital works programs that the then government undertook to get the economy moving, so it argued. Yet it turned out to be simply another example of a deliberate vote-buying exercise where grants were made to councils. At least they had a public set of guidelines, but those have been debated and the errors of their ways have been pointed out in detail recently and will be again. They were made in marginal and Labor seats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, that local capital works program directed twice the value of grants to Labor electorates as it did to coalition ones, despite the fact that the Labor Party held only 37 per cent of the total number of seats. In Victoria, my own state, grants to coalition electorates were concentrated in key Liberal marginal seats that Labor hoped to win back. Seats such as McEwen, Dunkley, Corinella, Ballarat and Bendigo were the main recipients of grants made to coalition electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is yet another example of a blatant misuse of public funds. This Labor government seems to regard taxpayers' money not as funds to be used in the overall national interest and in accordance with national interest criteria, but as funds to be used in ways that will most advantage the Labor Party in a narrow political sense without any regard at all to whether that coincides with the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier&mdash;I conclude on this note&mdash;there can be no worse political corruption in any country than when the governing party loses the power to distinguish between what is in the public interest and what is in the interest of its own narrow party political base. We now have a large number of examples&mdash;I am sure we will see more&mdash;to demonstrate to the Australian people beyond any doubt at all that this government has lost the ability to distinguish between those two fundamental aspects. As a result of that, we are seeing a political corruption, using taxpayers' money, that I think is unparalleled, certainly in my lifetime and, I would imagine, in the lifetime of most Australians. </PARA>
