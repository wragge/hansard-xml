<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins is one of the better ones. In the last sitting week, Senator Cook was at a conference in Melbourne. This week we all know where he is, although the minister did not seem to want to mention it. We all know that both Senator Ray and Senator Cook are in Malaysia. Our relations with Malaysia could have been helped in other ways, rather than by sending ministers there after the event. But that is by the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important issue is on what basis the government can, at its whim, decide ministers are going to go off on various conferences or for other reasons not attend question time. We have always accepted that, in relation to CHOGMs, or meetings of the forum in the Pacific, or longstanding, regular commitments in exceptional circumstances, it is legitimate. But this government is now going far beyond the normal, legitimate, accepted practice of the past. We at least ought to be given the courtesy of reasons as to why this is going to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you might have picked up that Senator Cook is not going to come back until after the Senate has risen. Apparently, he will not be here for the whole fortnight. Why is it necessary for the minister to be away from the parliament for the whole fortnight&mdash;a junior minister at that? It might well be that Senator Gareth Evans feels that he can pick up the trade portfolio again, but that is not a legitimate justification either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What can we do other than protest? There are all sorts of things that we can do to make the government's life more difficult but that we avoid. However, if this abuse of the process of the parliament is going to continue, we will have to look at our options.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, our ministers used to attend. Our ministers accepted a responsibility to attend the parliament and to answer questions. Mr Keating has a different attitude to the parliament. He does not see the responsibility to the parliament in the way that it was traditionally seen. It is just another example of his general attitude to the process, which he sees as more of a nuisance than as part of constructive democracy. On some occasion, can we get some general guidelines as to the basis upon which the government is going to decide which ministers will attend when&mdash;which conferences are of such note that ministers need not attend before the parliament? This is now getting to the ridiculous stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In the present circumstances I hesitate to use the expression `feigned indignation', but nonetheless there is ample evidence of that in the contribution that Senator Hill just made. Obviously, the circumstances which take both these ministers out of the country at the moment are such as to fully justify their absence from this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are not discretionary bilateral visits. It may have escaped Senator Hill's notice that the Uruguay Round is reaching its final stages and will not be completed until 15 December. Senator Cook, after a brief stop in Malaysia, will be going on to Geneva where he will be spending, in effect, the whole of that time in the last stages of the negotiations in his capacity&mdash;Senator Hill may have overlooked this&mdash;as chairman of the Cairns Group. Ministers from all over the world will be attending those negotiations in Geneva.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the decision of the MARA Foundation of Malaysia not to send 15 scholarship students to Eynesbury College in Adelaide, which is a privately owned educational establishment, at substantial financial cost to the college. How does the minister explain to Australian business why it should suffer as a result of the gratuitous indulgences of the Prime Minister? How could the minister also have got it so wrong when he advised the Senate on 25 November this year that, in his opinion, the relationship was `unlikely to be blown off course by the cross-winds of this kind'? Why did he not immediately, after the offensive remarks by Mr Keating, seek to minimise the damage rather than talk down the likely consequences?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3836" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in nobody's interests that the present problem with Malaysia escalate any further. I hope very much that the Malaysian cabinet may be prepared to accept a cooling-off period&mdash;a pause for reflection&mdash;before taking any further punitive or retaliatory measures of the kind that have been foreshadowed. I will certainly be making every effort that I can, including direct contact with my counterpart, if possible, to see what might be achievable in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our basic message remains very simple: no offence was intended and, if it was taken, we regret that. We value our relationship with Malaysia. We will do everything we reasonably can to keep it warm and productive, with the visits of Senator Cook and Senator Ray being current demonstrations of our commitment in that respect. But if a good relationship is to continue, it must be wanted and worked for by both sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be helpful to reflect on the circumstances that have surrounded each stage of the development of this problem. When each side understands how the other perceives a problem, there is usually a better chance of resolving it. In the first place, it would be helpful if the Malaysian side were to acknowledge the circumstances in which Mr Keating's original remarks were made. He had been asked on numerous previous occasions about his attitude to Dr Mahathir's non-appearance in Seattle and on each occasion replied in neutral terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on 21 November the question was put in the form of a request for comment on a reported statement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> that morning by Dr Mahathir that, `Perhaps you have to thumb your nose at people before they notice you'. To the extent that Mr Keating's reply emerged more sharply on this occasion than it had in earlier replies, this was an understandable reaction in the circumstances. I note that that was certainly the reaction of the opposition spokesmen Mr Peacock and Mr Fischer, and I do not think that their change of heart subsequently does them much credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second place, I think it would be helpful for Australians to understand the cultural context in which Mr Keating's remark was reported in Malaysia. The Malay word for `recalcitrant' is `kurang ajar' and to call someone kurang ajar in Malay, I discovered just a few days ago, is extremely insulting, much more so than the use of the English word would indicate. It means in Malay that one is ill-educated; it reflects seriously on one's background and family, implying that one's parents did not bring one up properly. I understand that Mr Keating's comment had all the more resonance in Malaysia, or at least in the Malay language press, because it was made just a few days after a particularly acrimonious exchange involving the use and subsequent withdrawal of this expression between a Malaysian minister and a member of the opposition Democratic Action Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third circumstance that should be taken into account by each country in evaluating the actions of the other is the very different way in which Australian and Malaysian political cultures operate in response to issues of this kind. In Malaysia when some real or perceived international slight is reported, then&mdash;other things being equal&mdash;the media and just about all other interest groups tend to reflexively line up in defence of the person or institution in question. In Australia, by contrast, the media and other key interest groups are very much more likely to line up against the person or institution in question, assuming that if a criticism is made there must be some case to answer. In these circumstances, the two different kinds of national reactions tend to feed off each other, with every report generating another round, respectively, of indignation and self-laceration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fourth circumstance that perhaps needs to be appreciated by the Malaysian side is that we in Australia cannot help but feel a little wounded by the strength of a number of the reported comments and reactions coming from Malaysia. Not only were there the actions taken by the information minister, and a number of statements made suggesting that commercial relationships with Australia were at risk&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do you expect from a leader whose forefathers were ex-convicts and social discards . . . this kind of person is not properly brought up, hence the bad manners.</PARA>
<PARA>Even taking into account the questions of translation to which I have referred, this goes much further than any Australian statement. Mr Keating's letter last week made the point very clearly that his remarks had not been calculated to offend: if he was less than fulsomely conciliatory or apologetic than Dr Mahathir would have preferred him to be, then perhaps some of the background atmosphere against which the letter was written will help explain why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the important thing at this stage is that no action be taken which will make the present situation worse than it is. With a relationship as fundamentally strong as Australia's and Malaysia's, there is no inherent reason why it need go off the rails. If we can have a cooling off period&mdash;and if we each make a real effort to understand why the other side has acted and reacted as it has&mdash;then there is no reason why our relationship cannot flourish in the future as it has in the past.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am able to inform the Senate that last week an agreement was signed between an Australian company, KITComm, which is a joint venture between Kennett International Technology of Queensland and several private investors, and an American company, PacAstro Inc. from Virginia in the United States. They have agreed to prepare a proposal to launch low orbiting satellites on an equatorial course from the very north of Australia near Darwin. The two-stage rockets are very inexpensive and very small. The satellite would be around 250 kilograms and would be used for remote monitoring and sensing work on a commercial basis only. I emphasise that this whole project is commercially driven, market driven, and is not requiring a government contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the consortium has already had discussions with the Northern Territory government. In today's press, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Perron, was very enthusiastic about the project. The project offers two launches of satellites but this could lead to launches, either at the site in the Northern Territory or from Woomera, of polar orbiting low earth satellites.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I did not mention this last week. This is a new development which I am sure that Senator Panizza, with his interest in satellites, would more than welcome. This is a new development involving the launching of rockets from the Northern Territory. The site that is being considered in conjunction with the Northern Territory government and the Australian Space Office would be within a 30-kilometre range of Darwin. I emphasise that there would have to be an environmental impact statement and consultations with the local community to ensure that all safety factors are taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in this morning's media, the chief of the Australian Space Council and also the director of the Northern Territory Economic Development Organisation, Professor Watt, talked about a $6 million to $10 million program for building this site, which would be within a 30-kilometre radius of Darwin. The rockets would take off eastwards in an equatorial orbit over the sea. Again, I want to emphasise that all appropriate measures will be considered, including an environmental impact statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the efforts of the Australian Space Office over the last few months, in consultation with the Australian company KITComm, have enabled us to get to this stage. When the actual development takes place is a matter for further discussion. Again, I emphasise that no Australian federal government money is required for this investment. However, we will continue to provide all advice that is appropriate. Again, this is another significant step forward in getting Australia a modest but reliable space program.</PARA>

In reaching a decision, he will consider the recommendations of the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports on which the foreign affairs portfolio is represented.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that there is speculation as to the implications for state and territory finances should the High Court decision invalidate these business franchise fees to which Senator Chris Evans refers, and of course we will all know tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business franchise fees are an important element of the revenue base of all states and territories. They are worth, I understand, some $3 billion annually. Obviously, therefore, the Commonwealth has received representations from the states and territories and we have indicated that we are prepared to take immediate measures to provide interim safety net arrangements so that there is no disruption to their overall financial position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term, this will involve safety net arrangements based on adjusting existing wholesale sales tax and excise rates. In the longer term, I understand that the states and territories would like a system closer to their current arrangements. The Commonwealth is prepared to consider such an arrangement, but a major consideration will be that any tax levied on behalf of the states and territories should be readily distinguishable from existing Commonwealth taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has written to all premiers and chief ministers setting out the principles on which the Commonwealth will proceed in the development of these arrangements. We have emphasised, for example, that the rates of customs and excise and wholesale sales tax would be increased with the aim of raising an amount sufficient to ensure that each state and territory would receive at least what it would have collected from existing business franchise fees without requiring revenue raised in one state or territory to be returned to another, which I think people would accept is a necessary principle. This would mean, though, that most states and territories would receive increased revenue and would be required to return such additional amounts to taxpayers generally within their borders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me be quite clear, therefore, about what this means: not one red cent extra will be retained by the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I made what I believe is an historic announcement for the veteran community of Western Australia. I was able to tell them that Ramsay Health Care Pty Ltd, an Australian owned and operated company, has been selected to take over Hollywood Repatriation General Hospital early next year. This means that the future of Hollywood hospital is guaranteed. I am able to assure the veteran community of Western Australia today that its access to Hollywood is absolutely guaranteed as a condition of sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government will pay $500 million over the next 10 years to purchase treatment for entitled veterans and war widows which will guarantee their health care into the next century. They will continue to have access to Hollywood for its full range of excellent treatment services without having to obtain authority first from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In fact, the new Hollywood private hospital will not only retain its existing services but also enhance them by expanding Hollywood's present links with the University of Western Australia medical school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim is to set new standards and make Hollywood the nation's leading private hospital with teaching status. Links in orthopaedic surgery, general medicine, general surgery and neurological surgery will be extended to include a number of other important areas. In addition, Ramsay Health Care plans a $20 million building and refurbishment program which will be implemented progressively. Major constructions will include a 150-bed block, an independent 40-bed psychiatric facility, four new operating theatres, and a new day surgery centre. A large medical centre, with up to 50 consulting rooms and practice suites, will be built and the outpatient clinic area will be redesigned. Ramsay has also guaranteed that it will maintain the aged and extended care department, the special psychiatric facility, the palliative care unit and the chapel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that on the same day in February that Ramsay Health Care takes over Hollywood, Western Australia's 30,000 entitled veterans and war widows will gain access to the repatriation private patient scheme, which will provide the wider options for local treatment that they particularly need as they grow older. Under this scheme they would be able to go to Hollywood or to their local public hospital as private patients in shared accommodation without the need for their doctor to contact the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The repatriation private patients scheme will also make it easier for them to gain access to local specialists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that the federal government, through the Repatriation Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, will continue to be responsible for the repatriation health care of veterans and war widows.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new health care arrangements will be closely monitored by the Western Australian treatment monitoring committee, which is made up of representatives of ex-service organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to place on record the government's deep appreciation of the crucial role played by the ex-service organisations in the consultative process leading up to yesterday's announcement. Not only did they make an enormous contribution to the developing of Hollywood's role, but also they acted at all times to ensure that the interests of the veteran community came first. Through the contract with Ramsay and the introduction of the repatriation private patients scheme, I am confident that this is a very good result for all Western Australian entitled beneficiaries, the veterans and war widows.</PARA>

The number of staff per child is a matter of state regulations and those regulations are set by the states; they are not proposed to be changed by the accreditation, which does not address staffing. The private child-care sector and the opposition must appreciate that the staffing arrangements are not included in these figures to any large extent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been a number of major articles in the last two days referring to, unfortunately, the continuing problems that piracy is causing the shipping industry, particularly now with the adoption of far more advanced forms of attack on merchant shipping which involve both automatic weapons and explosives. These attacks not only involve a threat to the safety of the ship's crew but also a serious threat to the risk of collision or pollution if the ship is then left disabled with no crew in control. This is a major international problem requiring cooperation between nations to coordinate efforts in regions where there is a relatively high level of pirate activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia strongly supports action that is currently being taken by the United Nations International Maritime Organisation to deal with the problem. Since the early 1980s the IMO has received over 400 reports of piracy and armed robbery against ships, with almost half of that number occurring in the last three years. So, clearly, this is a problem which is escalating. The IMO believes that the actual total is considerably higher than this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for Australia, our major trading routes coincide with some of the main danger areas in the world for piracy. Five Australian ships have been attacked by pirates in these areas. In January this year the IMO convened a special working group on piracy in the South-East Asian region, comprising experts from seven member countries including Australia. This group travelled to the Malacca-Singapore straits area in March this year and received full cooperation from these coastal states. This resulted in action by local authorities, which has seen a substantial improvement in shipping security in this region in the last few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the IMO working group has been widely distributed. It recommended a comprehensive range of procedures and measures that can be taken by ships and crews to protect themselves from piracy. These include: development by ships of an action plan to combat piracy, including heightened surveillance, better lighting on board the ships, securing and regularly inspecting the key access doors of the ships, and detection equipment, such as the provision of an additional stern radar to warn of approaching small craft.</PARA>

Is the government aware of numerous complaints from community-based Landcare groups regarding the substantial delays in receipt of their funding as a result of a directive from Minister Kelly that the funds are only to be made available through sitting Labor members in their electorates? Is the government also aware that the delays caused by the minister's politically based directive are threatening the ability of Landcare groups to undertake their projects because of the seasonal nature of these projects? Why has Minister Kelly seen fit to politicise $7 million in Landcare funding at the expense of the environment?

As a result of those recommendations to PMSEC, the government established an IDC and has responded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations are at the stage where the company is expecting a phone call or communication from Malaysia to give the go-ahead. Things have gone quiet. The manager said, `They have gone very quiet'. This order, worth $30 million, was the largest order this company had ever had. It has had some success in placing vehicles into Asia. Its last big order was 40 vehicles into Japan. This contract into Malaysia to provide civilian and army ambulances would have been the icing on the cake for this local Tamworth company which just this week celebrated 30 years in business. So it is a real kick in the guts, a real kick in the head, to this company, and it is a real disincentive for people in Australian industries to do something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also said that he did not know anything about AWA. Of course, AWA has quite a lot to say about this situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten per cent of this company's exports are going down the drain because a very stupid remark was made by a Prime Minister who did not understand what happens outside the chamber.

I am aware of some of the particular cases that have been mentioned&mdash;for example, the HEC one&mdash;on the basis of personal correspondence that I have received or at least caught up with since I have been back from overseas.

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a considered, deliberate and careful effort to do so last week with his letter, making clear that it was not a calculated intention to offend; and he made it further clear over the weekend that, if it had that effect, then he regretted it. So the language has been used which one hopes will prove to have some effect, particularly if, as I said today, we can go through some cooling off process and some slightly more systematic attempt on each side to understand what the other has, in fact, been saying in the context in which it has been said. </PARA>

But it is a matter of judgment in each case as to what is likely to be productive and what the nature of the relationships are.

If it was understandable for those remarks to be made in the opinion and judgment of opposition spokesmen, some of whom, certainly in the case of Mr Peacock, are amply experienced in this matter, then it should remain understandable in the context in which those remarks were made. What we have to try to do, however, is to ensure in a non-partisan, cool atmosphere that this issue is resolved as quickly as we can.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), to a question without notice asked by Senator Christopher Evans this day, relating to the High Court's forthcoming decision on State business franchise fees.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier today Senator McMullan, in responding to a question from Senator Chris Evans in reference to tomorrow's expected High Court decision in the so-called Capital Distributors case, attempted amongst other things to point to what he saw as an inconsistency in remarks that had been made in the last day or so by my colleague in the other place Mr Peter Reith in his statements about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several points need to be made in relation to the situation that the Commonwealth may find itself in tomorrow if, as seems likely and as is expected, the High Court finds that the states can no longer collect more than $3 billion in franchise fees. If that is the outcome of tomorrow's case, then that will obviously play very much into the hands of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, as we know, is the most centralist prime minister that this nation has ever had. He is a prime minister who has no regard whatsoever for the rights of the states, either those rights that the states have been given under the Constitution or otherwise through convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me, therefore, is that in the hearings before the High Court earlier this year the Commonwealth Solicitor-General informed the court on 20 April this year that if the states' powers to impose business franchise fees were overturned, then the Commonwealth would impose new taxes in their place. In other words, we would have a reduction in taxes collected by the states because of the High Court decision against the collection any longer of franchise fees. But, `Not to worry, states', says the Solicitor-General to the High Court, `because the Commonwealth will impose new taxes in their place'. That is a fairly extraordinary proposition to put, in my view. It is certainly highly inappropriate for a Solicitor-General to put to the High court because it runs the very serious risk of influencing the High Court's decision. The High Court's decision should be based on its own neutral analysis of the laws and actions and powers of the states under the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has not been answered in this place, to my knowledge, is whether the Solicitor-General was instructed by the government to make that commitment for new taxes so as to influence the High Court's decision against them, as indeed has been claimed by the states through at least two of the state premiers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to know, and I think the Australian public has a right to know, when cabinet made this decision about new taxes because that is what we are talking about. We are talking about the Commonwealth imposing new taxes. Australians have the right to know&mdash;the parliament and the taxpayers need to know&mdash;how many Australians will have to pay more tax under the Commonwealth's proposals. On the face of it, it looks as though the Commonwealth government would be simply adding yet a further episode to its ongoing saga of expansion of the Commonwealth's indirect tax base, including, in particular, sales tax and excise&mdash;the very prospect against which it has railed for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Reith has said in recent days, which I would have thought no right-minded federalist who believes in the separation of powers between the Commonwealth and the states and the rights of the states could possibly disagree with, is the proposition that, as any new consumption tax imposed by the Commonwealth will enhance the power of the Commonwealth, any new system must contain a quid pro quo. In other words, in some way the Commonwealth must make room for the states in some aspects of revenue collection just to maintain the status quo. But to say that if the states lose a revenue base a la the High Court decision tomorrow, if that in fact happens, we simply compensate by increasing Commonwealth taxes seems to add to the already enormous increase in centralism and the centralising of power under this government. </PARA>

<PARA>Last week I joined with Senator Collins in the opening of the latest stage of the F3 freeway which completes the link into Newcastle. It was a great occasion and it has achieved a lot but, in his response today, Senator Collins was very misleading in claiming that this road is finished.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. On 22 November 1993 following a recommendation by the Selection of Bills Committee contained in its Report No. 10 of 1993, the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill 1993 (the Bill) was referred to this Committee by the Senate. The Committee undertook enquires into the Bill including a public hearing and received a number of submissions and revised submissions from interested parties advocating amendments to the Bill. The Committee was to table its report to the Senate by Monday, 6 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Details of the framework embodied in the proposed legislation were forwarded to state and territory governments, industry and gas users for comment. The process of discussions on the scheme were expedited because of the deadline for introducing the legislation into the Parliament. The Second Reading Speech indicates the Government wants the scheme established by the Bill in place before the end of this financial year to assist the sale of the Moomba-Wilton Pipeline. The Bill is said to provide certainty for potential buyers of that pipeline by clearly setting out the regulatory environment that will apply to that and future interstate gas pipelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. At and following the public hearing on 26 November, the Department and the Association continued negotiations in an attempt to resolve outstanding differences about the regulatory scheme. While substantial progress has occurred, areas of dispute remain. On 3 December 1993, the Minister for Resources, the Hon. Michael Lee MP, wrote to the Committee to advise that the Bill will be dropped down the order of business and will be brought forward for debate early in the next session of Parliament. The Minister's letter outlines the current state of negotiations between the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and the Australian Gas Association and reports more work is needed to resolve outstanding issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The Committee therefore has resolved to seek an extension of time to report on the second sitting day of the first session of Parliament in 1994. This extension will enable the Committee to facilitate negotiations between the parties and report the outcome to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Childs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to advise you that I have decided that the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill 1993 will be dropped down the order of business and that this will now be brought forward for debate very early in the next session of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Standing Committee hearings on 26 November connected with the above bill, the Department and the Australian Gas Association (AGA) have been in close consultation with the objective of resolving outstanding issues. As I understand it, there remains one key matter of difference to address; that is the issue of the interstate pipelines that will be covered by the bill, and defining these in an effective way that achieves certainty and avoids circumvention on the intention of the legislation. More work is needed to ensure that "delivery points" are not used as an artifice to circumvent the third party access and antimonopoly provisions of the Bill. I have therefore agreed that Departmental discussion with industry will continue and I will consider the need for any amendments arising from these discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other matters raised by the Association during the Committee's hearings, I advise the Committee that I am prepared to introduce an amendment that will enable the interstate carrier to refuse the provision of haulage services to another person if the proposed arrangements do not comply with minimum "objective" standards. The standard will be based on national or industry standards and will be determined following consultation between the Department, the Trade Practices Commission and the AGA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of a statement to the Parliament on the issues raised by the Association, I have noted the Association's request and will be mindful of this when framing a statement following finalisation of all the amendments to the bill decided as appropriate.</PARA>

As honourable senators will recall, unlike the Federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner, who has the task of enforcing anti-discrimination legislation which prohibits discriminatory behaviour, the Director of the Affirmative Action Agency has the job of removing discrimination from the workplace by requiring employers to take positive action to ensure that their employment practices do not discriminate against women. Organisations covered by the Affirmative Action Act are required to develop and implement an affirmative action program and to report on the program annually to the Affirmative Action Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report of the Affirmative Action Agency, which has been tabled in the Senate today, covers a significant period in the history of the agency. The last year has seen the completion of the first major review of the effectiveness of the affirmative action legislation, although much of the work of the review was completed in 1991-92. The final report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quality and Commitment: The Next Steps</EMPHASIS> was published in January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has found that, while a high rate of compliance with the act has been achieved over the last five years, a great deal still has to be done to achieve equality of opportunity for women in the workplace. We only have to look at how few women have reached the top echelons of both business and government organisations to see evidence of this. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last year has also been significant for the agency because of a number of structural and policy changes to the agency's function. Not only has the agency become a statutory authority but also its director has been given the power to vary reporting requirements for those organisations with an excellent record on affirmative action. In addition, from January of this year the federal government has adopted a policy of contract compliance whereby employers who fail to comply with the Affirmative Action Act are no longer eligible for government contracts for goods or services and specified forms of industry assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, changes to the affirmative action legislation late last year also extended the role of the agency. From 1994 onwards, voluntary bodies with 100 or more paid employees will have to lodge affirmative action reports with the agency. As a result, around 147 non-government schools, 143 community organisations, and some 44 group training companies will be reporting to the agency for the first time in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition did not oppose the extended coverage of the act at the time it went through the Senate, we were aware of concerns expressed by some voluntary bodies regarding the expense involved in the reporting requirements and, further, that failure to comply with the legislation could jeopardise government assistance. Given the invaluable role many voluntary organisations have in our community, I would like to see next year's annual report address in some detail the impact the reporting requirements are having on these bodies. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>In taking note of the Auditor-General's efficiency audit of the national highway, I want to point out to the Senate that I believe the government has acted very inefficiently in regard to part of this project. The inefficiency relates to a problem concerning the construction of the F3 freeway north of Newcastle. I made some remarks about this earlier today after the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) was asked a question in this place by Senator West. The minister in his answer lauded the construction of the last section of the freeway into Newcastle. He referred to the world-class standard of that road. He somewhat unfairly interjected on my comment, saying that I did not say what I said when I saw him at the freeway opening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said precisely what I was going to say when I spoke to the minister at the F3 freeway. I told him then that I would compliment all authorities&mdash;state, local and federal&mdash;in the Senate on their efforts in getting that section of the F3 freeway into Newcastle completed in such quick time. I said that I would also compliment all levels of government on the standard of the road and on the fact that, at last, the centre of Sydney is linked to the centre of Newcastle, and expand on what that will mean for the local economy. I really feel that I have done what I said I would do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also said to the minister that this road is not finished. One of the most disturbing things I saw on the plaque on the side of the road was the bit at the bottom that says, `This marks the completion of the Newcastle-Sydney freeway'. The Newcastle-Sydney freeway is a concept that is about 20 years out of date. Certainly the intention originally was to link the two cities. Indeed, the freeway came through the centre of Newcastle on the original plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 15 years ago, it was realised that there needed to be many more roads to the north. North of Newcastle a booming north coast was developing. Further north of that was one of the fastest growing areas in Australia, which is Brisbane and the environment around it. Sydney also needed an excellent link road between those two cities. The original concept of the expressway was completely out of date. People should have been talking about the freeway into northern New South Wales, which certainly was not, and still is not, finished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole issue is summed up in the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> of 3 December 1993, the day after the minister left. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The region is now closer in time and distance to Sydney and business and population growth should accelerate if the Hunter plays its cards correctly. While the Federal and State governments deserve applause for the funding and construction of the road, they should also remember that the job is not really finished. A 60 km per hour zone and a roundabout at Ourimbah hardly suggests freeway conditions and petering out of the freeway into a two lane road at its Northern end could be dangerous. These problems should be resolved quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at how quickly the government is moving on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister announced at the opening of the road that feasibility studies and environmental impact studies were being done on a link road from Sugarloaf to the Branxton section of the New England Highway. That road is very necessary to take heavy trucks, and it would do enormous things for the city of Cessnock and the town of Kurri Kurri, which have been suffering under the current traffic arrangements for the past eight years. It should have been well advanced by this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the minister's environmental impact statements should have been done about five to eight years ago. The next stage of the construction of this road&mdash;the final completion of the road&mdash;should be well advanced if priority is given for that section. I suggest that it be given a higher priority before it is done. It certainly should be done. On the minister's planning, the job is probably 10 to 20 years away from completion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before that work is done, a link between the end of the F3, the New England Highway and the Pacific Highway urgently needs to be built. It is absolutely amazing that we have built 163 kilometres of road north of Sydney&mdash;it ought to be seen from the air&mdash;and it finishes in a swamp. Eight kilometres away is not only the New England Highway but also the Pacific Highway.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has put in place a national highway strategy, yet it has left this glaring hole in the national system. I would like the minister to visualise what will happen around 17 December this year&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Easter Thursday next year out of Minmi. I will lay bets with the minister on the length of the traffic snarl that will be created when people travelling north to Brisbane and the New England area for their holidays come into a country one-lane road off expressway conditions. Blind Freddy would have been able to see 10 years ago what was going to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the minister will say that a lot of money has been spent&mdash;I agree with and applaud that; it is terrific&mdash;but why finish an expressway eight kilometres short of its destination? We urgently need to overcome this problem. It is not only a matter of taking Sydney traffic to the north. As the minister is well aware from the letters to him and his response to the people of Beresfield, there are many other traffic snarl problems in this area. Into that traffic snarl, this road feeds Sydney traffic on a one-lane system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some plan to fast-track perhaps one side of the expressway's completion into the New England Highway system. That would greatly relieve the problem. The minister is nodding. Perhaps he can tell us when that is due to be completed. I believe that snarls like the ones that will be created around Christmas time and beyond will be around for quite a few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had the bright idea of completing the northbound section of the freeway and making Lenaghans Drive, a two-laned road, a one-way southbound section. If it were out in the middle of nowhere, that would be a sensible idea. But, in effect, this part of the road is in a fairly rapidly developing area of western Newcastle. There are a whole lot of plans to put in even further developments there. I wonder how the locals who go up and down those roads will cope. If this one-way road system proceeds, a person who wants to visit a neighbour who is in the wrong direction by one kilometre will have to travel eight kilometres up the road and come down another six or seven kilometres on the other side of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer is fairly obvious. When the Roads and Traffic Authority does the monitoring of traffic on this road, it will become extremely apparent that a much higher priority must be given to the proper completion of the F3 Freeway, which means linking it to the New England Highway and the Pacific Highway. This currently huge gap in the national highway system in one of the busiest areas of Australia will then finally be removed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words on the Auditor-General's report No. 15 of 1993-94, which is an efficiency report that has been undertaken under the provisions of the Audit Act. It is an important report because it is an audit into the government's national highway program. The national highway links Australia's major cities. It is a large program which provides for the construction and maintenance of the national highway. It is fully funded by the Commonwealth government and is administered by the Department of Transport and Communications, or DOTAC, by way of special purpose payments under section 96 of the constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget for this program is large. In the last financial year, 1992-93, the budget for the national highway was $810 million. As I understand from the report, the proposals for a new national highway program to be introduced during 1994 are currently being considered. Because of that, the report by the Auditor-General has particular relevance at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General reviewed the economy, the efficiency and the cost effectiveness of the management of the program's funding as administered by the Department of Transport and Communications. In his report, the Auditor-General has identified the scope for DOTAC to considerably improve its management of the program. As the Auditor-General said in his summary of the key points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considers that the Government intention evidenced in various statements requires DOTAC to actively manage and maximise benefits nationally. This is also consistent with the general requirements for special purpose payments. DOTAC considers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is in response to the Auditor-General's comments and findings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that it has given effect to the Government's intentions, and has exercised an appropriate form of program management in the context of the policy framework of the current program.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General says that there is a divergence of views between his office and DOTAC in respect of DOTAC's role in managing the national highway program. The Auditor-General states that this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . highlights an apparent ambiguity that should be formally resolved before the introduction of the new program in 1994 or if the current program is extended.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope in his response to this report the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) will inform the Senate of the government's views on this ambiguity and what is being done to resolve it. The Auditor-General continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO established some network management criteria and found opportunities for DOTAC to achieve potential savings and improvements in program oversight. The ANAO considers the audit findings are relevant to both the existing program and new program.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General believes that economies can be found out of the budget for the national highway program. He believes that there are ways to `drive the roads dollar further'. There has been notable evidence over recent years to support that view. The Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics report of July 1992 identified a maintenance repair option that could result in average annual savings of up to 15%.</PARA>
<PARA>On my calculations, 15 per cent adds up to around $60 million per year. That is, by any person's definition, a lot of money if it can be used more efficiently through improved arrangements. The Auditor-General stated in the report that as well as those improvements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Economies could be achieved by negotiating reductions in the administration expenses of State Road Authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>The report specifically mentions two economies that can be achieved. They are project management and contract administration costs which have the potential cost saving of up to $21 million and a further potential saving of up to $8 million through general administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are some of the ways taxpayers could get better value for their dollars spent on roads under the national highways program. There are other aspects that were commented on in the audit report. The audit report states that management requires improvement. For example, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DOTAC should ensure monthly payments match the States' actual expenditure and take account of surplus cash from the previous year. ANAO found that in 1992-93 the Commonwealth lost a potential $4.1m in interest on ALTD fund payments surplus to the States' requirements, of which $2m was on payments for the National Highway.</PARA>
<PARA>Those matters are of serious concern. They are points with which DOTAC does not agree in all instances. Indeed DOTAC contests many of the findings of the audit report in relation to the current program. For that reason, that places further importance on the need for the government to give a considered response to the audit report. If there are differences of view, then they ought to be resolved. I hope the minister will respond to this report. I did not get the feeling from the minister's body language that we will get much of a response at the moment. I hope that there will be a formal response to some of these matters because I presume we are close to looking at the 1994 program. This is another useful report from the Auditor-General and one which requires a response from the government and certainly warrants careful consideration by this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Short that this is a useful report. The differences between the Auditor-General's examination of this matter and ours are not very great at all. We agree with the Auditor-General that with constant attention further efficiencies can be achieved. That is the attitude that we take constantly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comprehensive response has been provided in that report and I am surprised that Senator Short has not read it. Throughout the report individual references are made to DOTAC's responses to various matters raised. A comprehensive response is contained as an appendix to the report. I see Senator Short nodding, so I assume that he has seen that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the concentration should be on outputs rather than inputs. If there is any difference between our views, that is where it lies. The fundamental situation is, and I have no intention of changing it, that the Commonwealth provides the money for these projects. We have just been talking about $225 million that was provided for a magnificent piece of work. We got very good value for money for that project and it came in well and truly under budget and on time with the opening of the F3 freeway at Newcastle. We are concentrating on getting value for money for our outputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advise Senator Short that a major survey has been done by an independent business organisation which comprehensively indicates that we are achieving world best practice in Australia with the construction of roadways. As I said during question time today, these projects are world class and price competitive. That is the bottom line. Although we provide the money, the work is managed largely by state government traffic authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator Short that we have a group of 30 officers in the department who are responsible at the Commonwealth end for administering the national highway system. The Victorian state government administers an equal length of road&mdash;that is, 18,500 kilometres; a useful benchmark&mdash;with a group of 1,500 bureaucrats, not 30. If people want to go down this track, it is perfectly possible that the Commonwealth could set up a much larger bureaucracy with its own in-house engineers. We could set up our own pavement testing systems. Senator Short will acknowledge that that is mentioned in the Auditor-General's report. But we choose not to do that. The best results that can be achieved for taxpayers in Australia, and we can demonstrate this, is by not duplicating what state government authorities already efficiently provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We provided every cent of the $225 million in funding for the F3 freeway project but the project was managed by the New South Wales department of works. It managed the project very efficiently. In past years there have been fixed allocations to the states and there has been the provision that where projects come in under budget the money is retained by the state and rolled over into other road projects. As Senator Short well knows, there is never any shortage of road projects on which we can effectively spend taxpayers' dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that has provided a very efficient in-house efficiency measure on state government road authorities&mdash;that is, in order to stretch the Commonwealth dollar for the states' own benefit as far as possible, they have been able to bring projects in efficiently under budget, retain that money and spend it on additional road projects. I can give a dozen examples off the top of my head of where that has happened in all states and territories of Australia. The Northern Territory is very efficient at spending the Commonwealth dollar as, I might add, is Western Australia. We do it with great alacrity. We probably have a better record for spending it quicker than anybody in the country and getting value for money on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it is efficient for the Commonwealth to increase dramatically the level of bureaucracy that we have, which we keep deliberately small, by duplicating the control and management functions that are already efficiently provided by state government road authorities; they do it very well and they have been doing it for a long time. We do not want to set up a separate system of road maintenance and checking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has insisted&mdash;and this is where we have given the lead&mdash;that state governments implement procedures such as pavement testing systems to test the efficiency with which road maintenance is carried out. It has been largely at the insistence of the Commonwealth government, as part of the conditions for these grants, that state authorities have moved to do this. So the Commonwealth has a very good track record of keeping the efficiency with which the state government authorities construct the roads at a very high level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of getting value for money&mdash;having seen it in my own electorate in the Northern Territory and in projects that I have personally been involved with on the road side of it&mdash;by and large, I think the state authorities do a very effective job of competently administering these road projects, and that is how it is set up. I feel, with the greatest respect to the Auditor-General, that to go to the extent that is required in terms of the inputs into the dollar of setting up a duplicate bureaucracy at Commonwealth level with our own engineers and so on testing the maintenance on the roads when state government authorities do it, we think, in a very efficient fashion would be very inefficient and provide a poor return for the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give one example of the kind of thing I am talking about which can produce off-the-top-of-the-head figures of $20 million, which Senator Short quoted. A fixed percentage fee is provided with contracts from the Commonwealth to cover all the unattributed costs that go into road projects&mdash;and they are significant&mdash;such as pre-planning procedures; all these things have to happen and they have to be paid for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Short has correctly said, that figure is set at four per cent. It has been set at four per cent for 20 years. We are currently reviewing it. Where the Auditor-General got his $20 million from is very simple. The Auditor-General has simply recommended that that four per cent figure be reduced to three per cent. Arithmetically, we cannot argue with that&mdash;if we use three per cent instead of four per cent, we save $20 million. Whether we can or not is another question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are negotiating that with the states at the moment. Senator Short has quite properly said that we are setting up a new arrangement for funding from next year on with us being responsible for the national highway system and state governments being responsible for roads outside of that with untied grants from the Commonwealth. We are now reviewing that figure. I confidently expect the states will say that the real cost of doing all of that is eight per cent instead of four per cent. I might be out a percentage point or two but I expect them to at least double it because of additional demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When plucking figures out of the air, it is just as easy to say that it should be eight per cent instead of four per cent as it is to say that it should be three per cent instead of four per cent and save $20 million. All I am saying is that those assumptions have to be tested a little more scrupulously than simply saying instead of four per cent it should be three, and we save $20 million if it is three. The states would contest that it has to be double what it is now, I have no doubt, but we will arrive at a figure which I think reasonably reflects the real costs of these unattributed costs for projects which are there. They have to be paid for by somebody, and we pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By and large, I think we are well served with the management that is provided by both state and territory road authorities. They are a pretty committed bunch of people; they are highly experienced. They do it on our behalf and, frankly, I think they do it far more efficiently than the Commonwealth could by setting up a duplicate system of checks and balances which the Auditor-General suggests we do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by commenting very briefly on the matters that Senator Tierney raised. They do not relate to the report, nevertheless, he raised them and they should be responded to. We acknowledge the need to complete the rest of the roadworks. I apologise to Senator Panizza for mishearing his interjection at question time today; he made the correct comment that every time we provide these roadworks they help. Certainly, they create other problems. The obvious one is that at any particular point in time a bottleneck will occur at the end of the particular section just finished&mdash;at a cost of $225 million&mdash;and the next bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tierney has acknowledged, the amount of work that we do unquestionably benefits the area. As I said during question time today, the important contribution that this new freeway extension from Sydney will make to Newcastle is that the connecting road between the city of Newcastle and the F3 freeway&mdash;and it is a magnificent piece of road, if honourable senators ever get a chance to look at it, from a scenic as well as an engineering point of view&mdash;has been brought forward two full years in order to coincide with the opening of the freeway so Newcastle can get the maximum benefit from this faster link to Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was said at the opening of that road&mdash;and I think it is true&mdash;was that it is quite extraordinary when one thinks that the first road connection that existed, a dirt road, between Sydney and Newcastle was only completed 63 years ago. When one has a look at what is there now in some of what is without question the most difficult terrain in which to build roads in Australia&mdash;just in that short 19 kilometre section there are 23 major bridges and a whole stack of road cuts and so on that have to be put in as well&mdash;it is a pretty significant enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is well aware that the work has to continue. We are not going to unnecessarily spend taxpayers' dollars on ploughing money into what are acknowledged as being temporary links. We are conducting a major environmental impact study into the permanent link between the F3 and the New England Highway. That is considering at least five major options for the routing of that road, and that is not an easy thing to do. It involves, for example, compulsory acquisition of land. It is not a simple task to determine where to put something as big as that. That will take at least 12 months. At the completion of that EIS we will have a firm decision on the preferred route for the permanent link and work will then commence on constructing that link. </PARA>

<PARA>Under the new proceedings for the processing of appropriation bills by the Senate, there is now the possibility of having supplementary meetings of estimates committees. Estimates Committee D had a supplementary meeting about four weeks ago and dealt with a variety of topics. Two of those issues are dealt with in this report. The first issue was a contract involving the disability reform program. The opposition has foreshadowed a minority report on this matter, and no doubt Senator Patterson will comment on the opposition's position on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue is the Centenary House lease. The committee report deals in a very objective and reasonable way with the evidence that has been accumulated on this matter. I believe it has gone as far as it can in seeking to get to the bottom of some of the issues that have been raised. There are obviously still some questions unanswered, especially to do with the knowledge of the Auditor-General and his office of the escalator clause in the lease and such things as his understanding of arrangements between him and the Department of Finance on continuing funding of the audit office, given the new accommodation it was proposing to move into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that, given that the Auditor-General has suggested an independent inquiry by the South Australian Auditor-General and that the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) has suggested an independent inquiry by the audit office's own auditor, both the South Australian Auditor-General and the external auditor of the audit office conduct an inquiry into the remaining questions. We have suggested that, if need be, a third person, acceptable to the Auditor-General and the Minister for Finance, be appointed as well. That is not an essential part of the suggestion. At least both of those persons should conduct an independent inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again I mention that the opposition, not unexpectedly, has produced a minority report on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a misunderstanding. The minority report was meant to get to Senator Coates last Friday week. I apologise for that. Senator Coates might recall that at our meeting we indicated that we would attempt to get the report out last Thursday week and that, failing that, we would get it to him by Friday. It was not the intent to leave it until the minority report was tabled here today for him to see it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As pointed out in the majority report, the matter of the Centenary House lease between the Commonwealth, on behalf of the Australian National Audit Office, and John Curtin House Ltd, which is owned by the Australian Labor Party, was the subject of intensive examination by the committee. The majority report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ostensible cause of concern in this matter has been whether the terms of the lease are "commercially sound". Underlying this are allegations and imputations of, in effect, impropriety: that the lease was negotiated at other than arm's length in order to provide advantage to the lessor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is in fact the Australian Labor Party. That is the reason why we put out a minority report. For instance, the term `ostensible cause of concern' was used, when the concern that we had was that Centenary House relates to the misuse of taxpayers' money, involving a lease agreement entered into by the Australian Property Group on behalf of the Australian National Audit Office. It is a classic example of the saying that if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and swims like a duck, one can be excused for assuming it is a duck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to this situation is that the Australian National Audit Office sought to combine all its facilities under one roof. It contacted the Australian Property Group to act on its behalf to find it one space instead of being under many roofs, as it had been previously. The Australian Property Group then entered into negotiations with Lend Lease. It called for expressions of interest from the various groups which would be interested in building a property for the Australian National Audit Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the negotiations progressed, Australian Estate Management&mdash;the owner of Commonwealth property throughout Australia&mdash;advised the Australian Property Group that it would not give its consent for the Australian National Audit Office to go into a separate building when it, the Australian estate manager, was attempting to accumulate property to justify the building of the York Park building in Barton. For some reason, that refusal to consent was withdrawn within a couple of days. No satisfactory answers were given to the committee by Australian Estate Management as to why that refusal was withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Property Group was also requested by Australian Estate Management to market the York Park building. Under the way the government operates, the Australian Property Group has a monopoly on government buildings and the letting of premises within the Australian Capital Territory. What came through in the committee's hearings was that for some reason the Australian Property Group did not market the York Park building. The question one must ask is why it did not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Property Group knew in October 1990 that the so-called Lend Lease building was the new ALP headquarters, but it did not tell the Australian National Audit Office about that connection until March 1991. In fact, in all communications between the Australian Property Group and the Australian National Audit Office the term used was `the Lend Lease site' or `the joint venturers'. Why did the Australian Property Group do that? One must ask why the Australian National Audit Office was not advised immediately that the owner was the Australian Labor Party. Why was it hiding that information?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of occupancy of Centenary House, the rental per square metre was estimated to be in the order of $40 per square metre higher than the average market rate within the Australian Capital Territory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I love to hear Senator Murphy making his interjections; they make our life so interesting. A deal was made that offered the Australian Labor Party a 15-year lease. For the period up to the occupancy, which was about two years, there would be a 10 per cent escalation of the rental, and from the date of occupancy, for 15 years, there would be nine per cent or market rate&mdash;whichever was the higher.

<PARA>Anyone with a primary knowledge of mathematics would know that an agreement that states that the rental will be increased by nine per cent per annum or market rate&mdash;whichever is the higher&mdash;will never achieve a market rental. I draw that to the Senate's attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to September 1991, the Australian Property Group also knew that the lease would include this escalator, or  ratchet clause, of approximately nine per cent, but provided the audit office, its client, with a draft letter of intent seeking the concurrence of the Australian National Audit Office. The letter did not mention a nine per cent escalation factor, which the Australian National Audit Office found out when the details of the lease became public in June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General himself has said that he probably deserves a little bit of criticism because he should have checked, but has pointed out that he relied on the operations of the Australian Property Group as the organisation he had to go to to work out a decent lease. Everyone is aware of the fact that the Australian Property Group has incredible bargaining power because it is able to offer a government tenant, which means security of rental. Normally, when that occurs it puts a value on the property which is substantially higher than when one takes the risk of a non-government tenant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out, the Australian Labor Party, through Centenary House, spent about $17 million. On the basis of the rental and the guarantee of a nine per cent increase every year for 15 years or market increases, whichever is the higher, and using the capitalisation factor of 8 1/2 per cent&mdash;a very conservative one, I might say&mdash;that promptly gives the ALP, at the expense of the taxpayers of Australia, an immediate capital gain of $12 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has become arrogant. We have seen recently the efforts of Mrs Kelly from the other chamber in handing out largess&mdash;again, other people's money; again, taxpayers' money&mdash;simply to win elections.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy says, `Through the taxpayer'. I thank Senator Murphy for that interjection. Here is a gift to the Australian Labor Party, at taxpayers' expense, of $12 million. This is unconscionable. If the government is confident that this deal is above board, why does the owner, the lessor, not agree to negotiate it? Why is that the case? That is another unanswered question. As I pointed out earlier, this was a series of actions which individually may not mean very much but which, when accumulated, raise the suspicions not only of people on our side but of the public at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were three major players in this exercise, apart from Lend Lease, which was acting on behalf of the ALP. They were: the Australian National Audit Office, as the eventual tenant; the Australian Property Group, which was required to act as any other real estate would do&mdash;to act on behalf of its client and get the client premises at the lowest possible rental; that is its job&mdash;and the Australian Valuation Office, which was called in and which would normally, I expect, be called in to give an opinion as to the valuation of the rental per square metre. I would not have expected the Valuation Office to be called in to go into all the details of the contract. That is the area of expertise of the Australian Property Group, yet the AVO was called in to give a much broader opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I got wind of this in January last year and put out a press release highlighting the fact that this deal had been made, my office was phoned by a person claiming to be an interested citizen. When that person was tracked down, it was found that he was the major negotiator for the Australian Property Group. Why did he do that? Well we may ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two major players from the Australian Property Group and one from the Australian Valuation Office. The biggest surprise of all is that all of the major players have since left. They have taken early retirement&mdash;and it is not as if they were approaching the age of retirement; they were not. Two have left and one has been promoted to another department. It is just one of those coincidences! Then we had the comment made in the majority report that, whereas these people had in fact left, the current officers advise that they had the benefit of a briefing from him. We were not born yesterday. They had a briefing from the main architect and he said that everything was okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised this question here the other day it reminded me of a little bit of history. Does the Senate remember the Petrov affair when Dr Evatt wrote to Mr Molotov and asked, `Is Petrov lying?'. He then got up in parliament and said, `Mr Molotov has written and said "Yes, he is"'. It is about as believable. You cannot ask someone who was a major player and who had left and then say, `However, we have had the benefit of a briefing'. That is like Caesar on Caesar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all those factors that add up. We all know&mdash;and no-one is disputing the fact&mdash;that here we have a Labor government in power whose organisational wing, the ALP, has arranged a deal through another group, the Lend Lease Corporation, with the net result being that, on a conservative calculation, from the day the Australian National Audit Office occupies that building, the ALP has a notional capital gain of $12 million. It can go out tomorrow and make $12 million at taxpayers' expense, paid for by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even worse, and adds to the questions, is that the Department of Finance has not accepted the lease conditions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know Senator Murphy does not like me to keep mentioning it, but they are the facts. The other thing that adds to our suspicion is the number of questions the estimates committee asked which went unanswered. An unanswered question put by me, which so far has had no response from the APG, was: why was the Centenary House&mdash;or the ALP&mdash;lease not to be a model for others? The claim was made that this is a good deal. If it is a good deal, why is it not the norm for all properties leased by the Commonwealth? I know of no other similar deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another unanswered question from Senator Bishop and Senator Campbell asked for details of other leases which had a fixed escalator of nine per cent per annum; there was no answer to that. We were advised that we would get a copy of the Centenary House lease as signed; as at today, that still has not been received. I asked the Australian Valuation Office to advise on Property Group lease terms; there has been no response to that. Senator Campbell asked a question about effective net rental higher than that of Centenary House; there was no response to that. I asked the question as to whether there had been any contact between the then minister, Senator Bolkus, or his office to facilitate Centenary House lease; there has been no response to that question either. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current state of this matter leaves serious allegations standing against the conduct and professionalism of the Australian Property Group and the Australian Valuation Office.</PARA>
<PARA>It recommends, as has been pointed out by Senator Coates, the proposal by the Auditor-General to have the Auditor-General from South Australia look at it and&mdash;in view of the negative reaction to that by Mr Willis&mdash;that perhaps it should be also the auditor of the Auditor-General plus some third party. The Auditor-General has pointed out publicly that the auditor of the Auditor-General can turn up in the audit office at any time, but generally he is limited to the Auditor-General's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recommended in the minority report that there be a separate inquiry into this matter. While I agree that the Auditor-General's recommendation should be pursued, there must be an inquiry of such stature that will enable the people carrying it out to go outside the Auditor-General, outside the Australian Property Group and outside the Australian Valuation Office. The allegations made in some of the stories conveyed to me by telephone&mdash;and I have not canvassed them as I do not think it would be proper to do so here&mdash;are such that whoever is appointed to carry out the inquiry should be enabled to go outside and have a look. But, equally importantly, the inquiry must be such that those people who give evidence before it must be given the privilege that is available to anyone else giving evidence before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this matter is serious. It is serious not just because the Australian Labor Party is the owner; it is serious because a lease agreement has been entered into which has terms and conditions associated with it which are not comparable with any other lease agreement entered into by the Commonwealth. All these separate factors indicate that an investigation is needed, and if the Labor Party and the Labor government consider it to be above-board, it should immediately instigate a review of the lease and the terms and conditions attached to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the report on the supplementary meeting of Estimates Committee D. In doing so, I begin by explaining my involvement in this matter. I was given the great honour of participating in this particular estimates committee as a stand-in for another senator who was on leave. So I came to this issue fresh and, in doing so, perhaps I was able to come across the evidence in a different way to that of many of the other committee members. I was only aware of these issues in so far as they related to press speculation. I had to make myself familiar with the detail of the evidence that had been heard by the estimates committee and with the various allegations that had been levelled publicly up to that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of my examination of the evidence, I am firmly of the view that there is no impropriety with regard to the leasing of the building known as Centenary House. I became aware that all major political parties in this country lease property to the Commonwealth. That was a fact that I was not aware of until I joined this committee. The National Party has rented property to the Commonwealth; the Liberal Party has rented property to the Commonwealth; and, of course, now the Labor Party is the owner of a building which is rented to the Commonwealth. This is a basic fact of life of which many people in this country are unaware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing double standards being applied when it comes to any matter relating to a commercial arrangement between a building owned by the Australian Labor Party and a government agency, despite the fact that all the evidence available clearly indicates the arm's length arrangements between the government and the commercial contract entered into between a government agency and the owner of this particular building. Not one skerrick of evidence has been produced to suggest anything to the contrary. Despite all the wild allegations of those opposite, not one skerrick of evidence has been produced to suggest that any minister of the Crown or any member of parliament has behaved in any way that is inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All arrangements have been based on the very simple proposition of sound commercial practice. The Auditor-General's office has made all the effective decisions in terms of the selection of this particular site, it has sought a particular site to meet its specifications and it is effectively in control of those arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And negligence perhaps. These are matters that Senator Campbell may find answers to with which he is not entirely happy. People listening to Senator Parer on this broadcast today might believe that somehow the Auditor-General, Mr Taylor, was not aware of the ALP's involvement in the ownership of the property until very late in the piece. It might also be suggested that the Australian National Audit Office played something less than an active role in the selection of the building and the negotiations leading to the agreement. Of course, both those propositions are clearly wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I preface my remarks by making a few comments about my support for an independent, credible auditor's office, and for ensuring that there is a proper functioning office that can keep public accountability on government expenditure that, equally, has high credibility in its dealings with other government agencies. My investigations suggest to me that had some of the answers given to us on that committee by the Auditor-General's office been given by a government agency, there may well have been a political outcry and a very damning report before this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that files were not adequately kept and that officers were unavailable in normal circumstances in any other agency would lead people to the conclusion that entirely the best practice was not followed&mdash;however, not the best practice followed by the Labor Party, by the Valuation Office, or by the Property Group but in terms of the operations of the audit office. Mr Taylor specifically canvassed the issue of ALP ownership at a meeting of senior staff on 12 April and recommended&mdash;it is indicated in correspondence&mdash;that the office wished to proceed because the ownership had no bearing on the operations of the audit office and the use of that tenanted space. Mr Taylor admitted that he had addressed senior staff on this matter in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 30 October 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to appreciate that in the negotiations at all relevant times the audit office was involved and consulted. In my judgment, after examining the evidence, it agreed to the terms and conditions of the lease. The 15-year duration of the lease was entirely appropriate to the circumstances on the evidence presented to the estimates committee. It was a specified building to meet the particular requirements of the particular tenant. The developer required the longer term lease to ensure ongoing commitment and to finance the construction. The ALP's involvement in the presentation of various planning documents obviously postdated the arrangements that were entered into, suggesting to me that the audit office clearly had an understanding of what was involved in the lease and in the terms and ownership of that particular property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was further documentation on the escalations clause in the files that the committee received. The auditor indicated to us that he was not aware that on 13 August 1991 Mr Dominic Collins had written to Mr John Barwood of the Australian National Audit Office, Medibank House in Phillip, indicating the various options that were available to the audit office, and seeking its agreement before entering any commitment. He outlined the following options:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) (i) Set a rent level at the time of entering a commitment; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Set a level now that would apply to the completion of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) (i) Establish a gross rent similar to the arrangements in Medibank House; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Establish a net rent which provides for the tenant to pay all outgoings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) (i) Negotiate a rent structure based on fixed escalations; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) Negotiate a rent structure based on market rents.</PARA>
<PARA>This clearly indicates the level of discussion that had taken place between officers of the ANAO and the Property Group. What was clear to me in the documentation that was presented is that the audit office was involved through its senior officers. The evidence clearly indicated that the Property Group and the Valuation Office were not prepared to deal with officers unless they were in a senior position within the audit office and clearly had the authority to act for the audit office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I have no doubt in my mind as to the sequence of events that occurred. Firstly, there was the request and the drive for the establishment of new premises essentially coming from within the audit office. The specifications were required to be laid down and there was an expression of interest from 14 different groups seeking to provide a building, including, as I recall, the Liberal Party. Of the 14 options pursued, the Lend Lease-ALP proposition was the one selected. After it was clearly identified publicly that the ALP was involved, the audit office decided to continue with the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those essential facts are clear. What I am concerned about and where there needs to be further inquiry is the relationship between the Department of Finance and the audit office. There is some tension in that relationship. In terms of the discussion surrounding the resource agreement&mdash;which goes beyond the rental of any one building; it goes to the entire financial operation of the audit office&mdash;it is not entirely clear to what extent the audit office understood its obligations and the Department of Finance understood its obligations. There appears to be some discrepancy there. This discrepancy may arise essentially because different agencies were involved in the preparation and the negotiation of the lease arrangements. One government agency was responsible for the resource agreement and another agency responsible for the leasing arrangement. The only agency that seemed to have a grip on both levels of activity was the audit office. The Property Group was not party to negotiation on the resource agreement, and the Department of Finance was not party to the negotiations on the lease. I repeat: it appears that the audit office was the only agency that was party to both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a problem which relates to the question of responsibility. The honourable senator opposite indicated a moment ago that there was concern about the responsibility of officers concerned to undertake fair and proper authority. As I understand the relevant spending of public moneys provision, finance regulation 44A, it requires that, in accordance with that regulation, it is the responsibility of the officer responsible for spending public moneys to ensure that any proposal is in accordance with Commonwealth policies and will make an effective and efficient use of the public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, finance regulation 44B, amongst other things, permits a person to enter into a commitment requiring the payment of public moneys only if the proposal to spend has been approved by a person with authority to do so, the commitment is consistent with any terms in the approval, the person entering the commitment is satisfied that the expenditure represents value for money, and sufficient funds to cover the expenditure have been or will be appropriated. These issues need to be addressed in any future inquiry. They do strike me as somewhat odd. If we apply the same standards to the audit office that the auditor applies to other government agencies, perhaps we will come up with some further questions and get some interesting answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some basic questions here about political propriety&mdash;not the political propriety of the Labor Party or of any particular agency but about an opposition that is effectively bereft of ideas and that finds it necessary to go into these sorts of issues because essentially it has nowhere else to go. It is a major problem in its arrangements. It tells one more about the Liberal Party's thinking than it does about the operations of this government. There is no evidence to suggest any impropriety on behalf of officers of the Department of Finance, of the Valuation Office, of the Property Group or of the Australian National audit office. There is no basis for any claims that are being made about any impropriety involving this government. There is a normal commercial arrangement which responds to the very location that the audit office sought for the property at Centenary House, being the central business district of government in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an inquiry perhaps would indicate is ways in which we can get improvements in the administration of government agencies such as the audit office in terms of its leasing arrangements. However, in my judgment, given the evidence we have seen before this committee, an inquiry will not demonstrate that the allegations Senator Parer has been making have any substance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this is an issue that goes to the provision of very high standard accommodation&mdash;to the specification provided for by the audit office. Of course, ownership of the building does not mean control of the actual activities of any particular tenant&mdash;any more than a government agency that rents space from either the National Party or Liberal Party has to fear interference from those political parties. The contrary proposition is founded on basic assumptions which are fundamentally flawed. When this matter is looked at properly and rationally with an objective examination of the evidence, it will be seen that there is no basis whatsoever to the claims of impropriety that are being made. </PARA>

In talking about impropriety and so forth, he is building up straw men and then knocking them over.

They remain of significant concern not only to the opposition but also to Australian taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Australian National Audit Office has entered into an unconscionable contract with the Australian Labor Party. It has been locked into a 15-year lease, which is one of the longest leases for a commercial building in any Australian capital city. It has been locked into a nine per cent per annum rental increase, starting from September this year, which will lead to an annual gross rental of $1,297 a square metre by the end of the lease. This nine per cent increase is a minimum because, on top of that, if rental rates actually do increase there is provision for a market review so that it can go above nine per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor of the lease which Senator Parer referred to was the escalation during the period of construction&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was 10 1/2 per cent. Again, that is quite exorbitant. The starting rental was another issue that was referred to at two of the estimates committee hearings, and it remains an issue because the rental that the audit office is now paying is above any rental that is being paid in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this juncture, it is important to refer to some of the evidence provided by Mr Coleman from the Australian Valuation Office. At the supplementary hearings on 9 November I asked Mr Coleman&mdash;I should not use the emotive term `cross-examined'&mdash;some questions regarding press coverage on 25 September where Mr Coleman was reported in a range of newspapers across the country as saying that he thought the rent that the Auditor-General was paying was below the market. There were headlines across the country saying that the Auditor-General was paying below market. This was astounding to me because I know that the rent is a high one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Valuation Office spent ages trying to convince the Senate estimates committee that the rent was below market when of course it is not. In the evidence Mr Coleman gave on 9 November, he agreed with me that the statement that the rent was below market was actually false&mdash;that, indeed, the rent was certainly not below market; it was, in Mr Coleman's terms, fair market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Coleman presented two pieces of comparable rental evidence to our Senate estimates committee to prove that the rent was fair market. One of those examples was the White Industries building in Civic, referred to as building No. 4, where the rent was $347 a square metre. I remind honourable senators, and anyone else who is listening in, that the net starting rental that the Auditor-General is now paying at the ALP building is $367.50 a square metre, and all of the running costs of the building add another $40 to $45 a square metre on top of that. So, starting now, the audit office is paying to the Australian Labor Party roughly $420 a square metre and, as I said, it is fixed to escalate by nine per cent every year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a new graph. We have brought it up to date. In the evidence given to the estimates committee the Australian Valuation Office said that it based its advice, which was that the escalations should be no higher than nine per cent, on the fact that rents had escalated in Canberra over the previous 15 years at an average of nine per cent. It is simply not fair to say that, because there has been an average increase of nine per cent in Canberra over the last 15 years, there should be a minimum guaranteed nine per cent compounding increase over the next 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Canberra over the past 15 years, there have been some years when there was no growth at all, other years when there has been 13 or 14 per cent growth and other years of bubbling along. The fact is that in the contract signed with the Australian National Audit Office the Australian Labor Party has been guaranteed that, no matter what happens&mdash;if hell freezes over, if Mount Kosciusko falls over, if Lake Burley Griffin empties out or if the whole of the country comes to a standstill&mdash;it will receive a compounding nine per cent increase in rental every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to Senator Carr, who has now left the chamber, that if he had a real estate agent go out and find him a home unit in Canberra to rent and that agent entered into an agreement to escalate Senator Carr's townhouse rental by nine per cent every year for the next 15 years, Senator Carr would be in court suing that real estate agent as quick he could because, again, that would be an unconscionable contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that needs to be addressed is whether the rent is a fair market rental. I return to the fact that Mr Coleman, the head of the Australian Valuation Office, who was giving evidence at the committee hearing on 9 November, referred to this White Industries building which had a rent of $347 a square metre. That rent, we are informed by the industry&mdash;and I am quite happy to be corrected if I am wrong&mdash;is a gross rent which would mean that the net rent is more like $300 a square metre compared with the $367 a square metre which the Australian taxpayer has to pay for the ALP's building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Mr Coleman gave evidence of DAAS's building in Alinga Street where a recently reviewed rental was $351 a square metre. Again, if one deducts the outgoings from what is a gross rent, that rental comes down to $305 a square metre. So the Australian National Audit Office is paying some $67 to $70 a square metre&mdash;for thousands of square metres of office space&mdash;above the market rental. Mr Coleman came before our committee and said that the Australian National Audit Office was paying a fair market rent. I put this to Mr Coleman on 9 November:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are all new buildings, Senator Murphy. This is where the evidence comes from. They are buildings such as the Burns Centre, which we drive past every day, and Centenary House. The fact of the matter is that the Australian Valuation Office has given bad advice to the Australian National Audit Office. I put to the Senate that, if any commercial operation went out and got advice from a valuer which was as bad as the advice that the Australian Valuation Office gave to the Auditor-General or the Australian Property Group, in terms of the starting rental, which is far too high, the escalation factor of 10 per cent during construction, which has proved to be between two and three times as high as it should have been, and the nine per cent rental increases for the next 15 years, we would sue that valuer for negligence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Senate that, in any private practice, valuers have to pay enormous amounts of money for professional indemnity insurance. I would be very interested to know whether the Australian National Audit Office has any right of action&mdash;and I presume that it does not&mdash;firstly, against the Australian Valuation Office, because I believe that the advice given has been negligent and that that needs to be investigated and, secondly, against the Australian Property Group, which I will now turn to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Property Group was supposed to be acting on behalf of the Australian National Audit Office&mdash;its client. When it goes into bat for a client who is paying its fees quite handsomely, it should be acting in the interests of its client. It should be going in and doing the best deal it possibly can for its client and it should be rewarded by the payment of a fee. Had the Australian National Audit Office gone to a private property consultancy, then that is exactly what would have happened. But the Australian Property Group seemed to be like a broker between the two of them. It actually negotiated a deal that really had nothing in it that was of any assistance whatsoever to the Auditor-General. In fact, the Auditor-General himself has said that, if he could renegotiate the deal, he would get out of it straight away. He does not want to be locked into a nine per cent guaranteed rental increase for the next 15 years. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Reid says, nor should he be. The fact of the matter was&mdash;and Senator Carr chose to forget this&mdash;that the Auditor-General's office had no idea that it was locked into a nine per cent fixed minimum guaranteed compounding rental increase until after the lease documents had been signed. That was the evidence given to the committee. Senator Carr chooses to ignore that evidence, but that is one of the facts of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous doubt as to the communications between the Australian Property Group and the Australian National Audit Office. Senator Carr and Senator Murphy choose to have the Senate believe that the Auditor-General was in some way not up to the mark in not knowing that he had a lease with a nine per cent rental increase. The facts revealed in the estimates committee&mdash;and Senator McMullan was there and admitted it&mdash;were that the Australian Property Group never, in any correspondence, advised the Australian National Audit Office of the specific detail of the term of the lease or the rental increase. It did not really know about it until after it was signed and it was all put to bed. That is why, all of a sudden, this has become a big issue. The Australian taxpayers have realised that they have been locked into a deal by the Australian Property Group to pay the Australian Labor Party millions and millions of dollars for the next 15 years. My view and the view of the opposition is that this deal should be investigated and renegotiated because the Auditor-General cannot operate under this lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to the Australian Property Group. It could have negotiated, in the interests of the Auditor-General, if the Auditor-General's office required security of tenure over a 15-year period, a quite normal arrangement, which would have been a 10-year lease, which is still an extremely long lease. Anyone who says that the ALP or Lend Lease could not finance the project on a 10-year lease with a high starting rental is kidding himself and trying to kid the Senate. A 10-year lease to a government tenant with a fixed starting rent and fixed escalators is a tremendous deal for anyone to finance. As I have said in the estimates committee a couple of times, when I have been boring everyone and myself, one would have developers and financiers queuing up at the door, running from Canberra right down the Hume Highway. Hundreds of developers and financiers would be clambering on top of each other to finance the deal. So it is absolute rubbish to say that one has to have a 15-year contract to get a financier interested in that deal. People would love to have done that deal on a 10-year lease. The Auditor-General could have been given a five-year option to renew the lease at the end of that 10-year term. That would be a quite sensible and normal commercial negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people deserve to know the facts from the Australian Property Group. Ms Cathy Argall, who gave evidence to the estimates committee, could not in any way show the estimates committee&mdash;she certainly could not convince me&mdash;that the deal that it negotiated had anything in it for its client, the Australian National Audit Office, the people who pay the APG's fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the contrary, these minimum escalation clauses work very much against the interests of the tenant for whom the Australian Property Group was negotiating. There needs to be a thorough investigation into how the Australian Property Group negotiated, on behalf of its client, the correspondence that was carried out between the Australian Property Group and the Australian National Audit Office. There is absolutely no doubt from the evidence we were given on 9 November that the Australian National Audit Office was not kept informed of absolutely essential elements of the negotiation, such as the escalation clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proof of the pudding is in what the Australian National Audit Office has told the world at large: we cannot live with a nine per cent rental increase. If the Australian National Audit Office had been told by the Australian Property Group prior to entering the commitment that it was going to have a nine per cent minimum guaranteed rental increase, the Australian National Audit Office could not have possibly agreed to it. The Department of Finance would not have let it agree to it. The fact of the matter is that there was an enormous breakdown in communications. My view is that the Australian Property Group was negligent and failed in its duty to its client. Again, in a private negotiation between a private sector company and a property consultancy, if that property consultancy went and entered into some sort of agreement on behalf of a client that locked it into a 15-year lease with nine per cent increases, the private sector client would sue that agency for negligence and that agency would most likely have to pay significant damages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters need to be investigated. My view is that the Australian Property Group and the Australian Valuation Office have a lot more questions to answer in terms of their professional integrity, whether or not they acted on behalf of their clients in a professional manner and whether or not property officers at the Australian Property Group and valuers at the Australian Valuation Office were not very negligent with respect to the advice that was provided and the whole way that this deal was entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sad reflection on the Australian Property Group, which has many fine officers right around this country, and the Australian Valuation Office, which is staffed with professionals right around this country who do tremendous work for the Commonwealth and the people of Australia, that a slur on these organisations has eventuated from what is effectively a slimy deal involving the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party is the only winner out of this deal. It has a guaranteed income. It will ensure that, regardless of the political fortunes of the Australian Labor Party; no matter how bad Mr Keating gets; no matter how many Thai teak tables he has; no matter how many ministers, such as Mrs Kelly, make a joke of his government; no matter how many failures or political disasters strike the Australian Labor Party; and no matter how many seats we rout them by at the next federal election, the Australian Labor Party is assured of at least a 15-year future. It had a guaranteed income at the expense of the Australian taxpayer and, I might say, at the expense of the independence, impartiality and resourcing of the Auditor-General and the operations of his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely crucial, as Senator Carr said, that we have a strong, vigilant and well-resourced Auditor-General's office that can look, without any fear or favour, at the operations of government and government entities, and provide information to the parliament and the taxpayers of Australia about the efficiency and financial accountability of those entities. If the Auditor-General has to suffer a nine per cent decrease in the amount of money that he can resource into his primary role of conducting investigations&mdash;it is being sucked away by a great big vacuum cleaner called the Australian Labor Party's property fund; and it is going up year after year at nine per cent&mdash;his ability to assess independently the operations of the government will be limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Australian Labor Party would like to see that happen. Senator Carr, Mr Keating and their brethren do not really enjoy the Auditor-General bringing down reports like the one that was brought down two weeks ago on the mismanagement and plain political pork-barrelling that went on in the handing out of sports grants prior to the last election. They do not like the operations of their government&mdash;the mismanagement and the maladministration&mdash;being brought under the scrutiny of the Australian National Audit Office. They do not like the operations of their government being brought to the attention of Senate committees. They are intent on screwing down the financial resources and the manpower resources of Senate committees. They have absolute contempt for Senate committees and they also have contempt for the Australian National Audit Office. If Australia is going to be a vigorous democracy with a government that is accountable to the people through the parliament, we need a strong and independent auditor and we need a strong Senate committee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by calling for a thorough investigation of the handling of this property transaction by the Australian Valuation Office and the Australian Property Group. If, as I suspect, there have been significant failures in both of those organisations, it really is incumbent upon the government to renegotiate this whole unconscionable contract that has been entered into with the Australian Labor Party. It is quite outrageous that the Australian taxpayer should be funding the ALP into the next century by way of this exorbitant rent and these unconscionable rental increases. </PARA>

Senator Parer mentioned the York Park building. He said the Australian Property Group did not market and did not present this building as an option to the ANAO, when it fact it was presented. One of the reasons the ANAO chose not to take York Park as an option is that it was not certain that it would be built. In fact, at that time it had not even been approved by cabinet. Today it is still not completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really comes down to the decision making process. Who made the decisions with respect to finally going into Centenary House?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the important question in this whole decision making process is: who made the decisions with regard to the final signing of the lease?

In looking at the criticisms that the Auditor-General has laid at the feet of other government enterprises&mdash;even with respect to these sorts of matters&mdash;one would have to wonder at the circumstances confronting the Auditor-General with regard to his own enterprise going into a lease arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very important claims made at the committee hearing was that the Auditor-General's office did not know that it would have to meet the additional cost. A letter dated 16 November sent to the secretary of the committee from the Department of Finance refutes that claim. It has with it a range of correspondence which, in my view, supports the position of the Department of Finance. Over and above that, the Auditor-General has picked up on leasing arrangements in some other reports. We ought to be aware of what is common practice with all government enterprises in relation to the financing of arrangements through the Department of Finance. I am no expert in this area, but if one reads some of the correspondence, one sees that it raises very serious questions as to who knew what. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the arrangements, we also have a letter that was tabled at the committee hearing, signed by Dominic Collins from the Australian Property Group and sent to a Mr John Barwood of the Australian National Audit Office in August 1991.

Again, the Auditor-General's office says that the records are not complete, yet it accuses other enterprises within government on the basis that that occurred elsewhere. What Senator Campbell said was right&mdash;we cannot accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government accepts the need to have an inquiry. That inquiry ought to clarify some of those issues. That really goes to the matter of the funding shortfall referred to in the minority report. In particular, page 14 of the minority report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the period of the lease there is a total shortfall of $34.1 million which the ANAO will have to find from its own resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some statements contained in this minority report are factually incorrect, and that is one of them. It does not take account of anything other than the basis of the rental that may be paid, and it certainly does not take account of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to rents paid, Senator Campbell tabled a graph that he has tabled about six times elsewhere. It seems to change on most occasions; I think he said it was a new graph today. When one looks at accommodation costs, both nationally and within Canberra, and commercial rental accommodation costs in the eastern seaboard versus Western Australia and here, one could go to Sydney and Melbourne and have vacancy rates of 20 per cent or maybe higher. The vacancy rate in Canberra is less than five per cent. It does not matter what one buys in the Barton area and in the Parliamentary Triangle&mdash;which is where the ANAO wanted to be. If one bought a car in the Parliamentary Triangle one would probably have to pay more for it. Since I have been in this place I cannot even begin to think about purchasing property or, indeed, renting accommodation in the Barton area, and certainly not within the Parliamentary Triangle. It is important to note that assessments of rental comparisons within the Barton area over the last 10 years which were presented to the committee showed that the actual rental growth over that period has been substantially higher than nine per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are reviews at five, 10, and 15 years of the arrangements for Centenary House. As Senator Campbell pointed out, if the market rate does exceed nine per cent at the year of the review, the base is adjusted in accordance with that. It is adjusted only by that factor and only for that particular review year. The escalator remains at nine per cent until the next review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is a pity that the Liberal Party has chosen to politicise this issue rather than to deal with the facts. It has tried to infer that the ALP has been doing something untoward by the mere fact that it now rents accommodation to the Commonwealth. I reiterate that what Senator Parer and Senator Campbell chose not to mention was that the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats do the same. I do not know what those arrangements are. In the case of this particular arrangement, a representative acted on behalf of the ALP during the negotiations with the Australian Property Group. All of the parties normally involved in arrangements to be put in place for Commonwealth rental were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that the ANAO was not kept informed is not supported by the evidence. The evidence clearly supports the fact that the ANAO was informed. In fact, the Australian Property Group said during the committee hearing that it offered assistance&mdash;that is supported by the letter that, unfortunately, the Australian National Audit Office says it does not have&mdash;with respect to negotiations with the Department of Finance for the financing of the rent requirements. That offer was rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, as has now been further supported by the Department of Finance correspondence, the Department of Finance says very clearly that the Australian National Audit Office was well aware of the arrangements that it was entering into. It was well aware of what the Department of Finance was prepared to finance by way of the agreement. It very clearly says that in the agreement between the Australian National Audit Office and the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked a question of the Auditor-General with respect to this agreement. He said that the agreement was only for the fit-out. Point 1 of the first paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This agreement details the terms and conditions for the funding of the ANAO's accommodation move in Canberra to Section 22 Barton. It formalises agreements previously reached through the interchange of correspondence and meetings of officers from the Department of Finance (DOF) and the ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this agreement is to allow the ANAO to fit out and occupy leased premises in Section 22 Barton.</PARA>
<PARA>It then states how the repayment of moneys will be conducted as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where the ANAO adopts a strategy to provide accommodation for less than 100 per cent of its staff at a particular location, the resulting savings will be made available to the ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I understand it, that is how the Auditor-General thought he may be able to meet the additional cost in rent. Therefore, we really have to deal with the facts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a rather poor attempt at defending the indefensible. This agreement to lease is one of the most appalling documents that we have ever seen in the whole history of public administration. On its own admission, the Australian Property Group has said that this agreement is a one-off. There is no precedent for it, there is no other one like it and the Australian Property Group has informed all and sundry that it is not to be regarded as an acceptable model under which any other agreement is to be reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that we have this very special agreement that delivers $86 million out of the public till to the Labor Party coffers over 15 years? Why is it that the Department of Finance said that it believes the nine per cent annual increment, as provided for in the agreement for lease and the lease itself, is an unacceptable term; that it is not commercial; and that, therefore, the department will only provide for a one per cent increment, which means that the Labor Party will receive $34 million less than is provided for under the lease?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has given evidence that by the year 1995-96 he will have run out of money to do his job properly. That may well suit the intent of some in the government&mdash;they would probably quite like that&mdash;but it does not serve the public interest. The Department of Finance is very sensible, and thank goodness we have the Department of Finance, which was able to bring this to the attention of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we have heard some rather pathetic attempts to defend the indefensible. I understand why the Labor Party would go to the barricades to protect this lease&mdash;$86 million will pay for a lot of elections. Indeed, the day that that agreement to lease was entered into, the Labor Party entered into a mortgage for $50 million. In other words, that lease document was a bankable document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial statements of John Curtin House state that the building cost no more than $22 million to build. But the Labor Party got a mortgage for $50 million, because the lease document is a bankable document. Why is that so? The reason is that the agreement is for 15 years with a five per cent option and a built-in nine per cent annual increment that may not be negotiated down; it may only be negotiated up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying a five-year option after 15 years, with a nine per cent annual increment&mdash;unprecedented in any other government contract&mdash;over a 15-year period, and $86 million goes into the coffers of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this matter was brought to the Senate's attention, first by my colleague Senator Parer in a press release and then by my asking questions in the estimates committees, we suddenly discovered that we could not get the particulars of the rental, the increment and all the terms and conditions that would be associated with this document and lease. I said to the Australian Democrats, `Democrats, will you please agree with the opposition that we won't give the government its appropriations bills until such time as it tables the lease documentation in the parliament?'. The Democrats agreed to that and at half past one in the morning we got the documents, but guess what? All the salient parts&mdash;all the figures&mdash;were whited out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until later that I really recognised the significance of all this. I thought the government had been using executive power to enter into these lease agreements, but I found out subsequently that it had been relying on the Lands Acquisition Act. That is why the Attorney-General's Department signs the leases and is involved in giving advice at the last minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised, and evidence was given, that, as we know, the Lands Acquisition Act provides that, once an agreement is signed, it is mandatory upon the government to table all  relevant documentation in both houses of parliament. Guess what? It did not happen. Not only did it not happen, but when the department was forced to give us the documentation, it deliberately whited out all the particulars, which the act on which it relied said must be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was it an oversight? That was the answer given by the manager of the Australian Property Group when I asked him why they did not comply with the law. His answer was that it was an administrative oversight. How convenient!<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party is saved and its money is protected because another subclause in the act states that failure to table the documentation will not render the agreement invalid.

It was referred to as lot 22 Barton or the Lend Lease development. We never saw the Labor Party's name on it until we saw the actual development plans. That was very convenient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this sensitive agreement and the Labor Party benefiting from the taxpayers' purse to the tune of $86 million over 15 years. There was legislation in place that required the documentation to be tabled in the parliament, and that was deliberately not complied with. When we forced the Labor Party to put the documentation on the table it whited out all the particulars. Administrative oversight? Pardon my cynicism, but I do not think so. At every turn there was an attempt to keep this matter hidden until it was locked up, and the Labor Party benefits at the taxpayers' expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence has been given that the rental is way above the rental paid by everybody else in the Canberra area. There is evidence in the so-called independent report by Baillieu Knight Frank that says, `This is a legal matter, get some legal advice.' It is very interesting to see, when people go around collecting evidence in this town, how frightened individuals are that they might not get government business if they provide further evidence that might go against the Labor Party. What a sinister town this is becoming!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of day we find that no proper outside valuations were made, that it was a cosy in-house deal. The consensus afterwards is that it is a non-commercial lease and that the Auditor-General has been duped into becoming the meat in the sandwich. This is because the agreement is between the Commonwealth and the Labor Party. It was not signed by an agency of the government; it was signed by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) who is exercising delegated authority under the Lands Acquisition Act. Those are the facts. The Commonwealth has entered into an agreement which benefits the Labor Party and all propriety was cast asunder and it was not properly disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues Senator Campbell and Senator Parer have in very fulsome ways outlined why this process reeks to high heaven. Senator Parer says that this lease should be negotiated so that it is in accordance with the principles of the Department of Finance. He and I have said these things over a period of months. Yet at every turn the Labor Party resists because at stake is its $50 million mortgage. If this lease is broken, where is the cash flow going to come from to meet the mortgage repayments. The taxpayer is being held to ransom so that the Labor Party can circumvent the laws that require disclosure of how much tomato sauce was bought to use at a sausage sizzle, as we on this side of the chamber have to do. The Labor Party bypasses those laws and takes the money straight from the taxpayers' pocket. It is a pipeline to the Mint; $86 million straight into the Labor Party coffers to buy its way into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the most disgraceful agreement we have ever seen. It is one which many of us will continue to pursue until there is some decency in the Labor Party and it says that it will renegotiate the agreement in accordance with the principles of the Department of Finance. That is what is being called upon with this agreement. What we are calling for in this debate is that there be some decency and the agreement be renegotiated so that there can be at least some acknowledgment by the Labor Party of the uncommercial, unfair advantage it is giving itself by way of funding out of the taxpayers' purse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address another issue which is in the Estimate Committee D report. I have concerns about the issues raised by my colleagues, but they have canvassed the issues very broadly and expressed the concerns of the coalition. My concern relates to the contract to market the disability reform package. Page 4 of the majority report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter again received substantial attention during the Committee's meeting with Senator Patterson directing questions about the involvement of the Office of Government Information and Advertising in the letting and management of the DRP contract.</PARA>
<PARA>At point 12 it continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attention is drawn to the attached minority report on this matter by Opposition members of the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>I express concern that that is the only comment that the Chair had to make on this issue. I am not a member of that committee but I went to that meeting because, in order to investigate this issue, I had to go across a number of estimates committees. We have seen some articles in the press recently about the role of estimates committees and their value. Had we not had estimates committees this issue would have been undiscovered and we would not have known the extent of the problems associated with the letting of this contract and the implementation of the contract. I take issue with those journalists who say that estimates committees do not do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that they may seem time consuming and, as Senator Alston said publicly, we may need to address the ways in which those estimates committees are conducted. That is the government's business. It can do that. It can organise the departments to be there. We have been very constructive in suggesting, for example, whether we need the Australian Institute of Family Studies to appear. The coalition has been very cooperative in that regard. We would be cooperative if the government came up with a reasonable solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the issue about estimates committees, the minority report I submitted highlights my grave concerns about the letting of this contract. This contract was for $4.9 million of taxpayers' money and it was to publicise the disability reform package. I became interested in this matter when workers in the disabilities area came to me and said that they were concerned about what was happening with the contract and they had questions about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the Senate some of the points I outlined in the minority report. That report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Working Committee of the Ministerial Counsel on Information and Advertising only sought one alternative to the mainstream advertising approach. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I will explain this. This program was to be publicised. The working committee of the ministerial council had a process of looking at, by selective tender, companies that might do this. At first, four or five advertising companies were chosen and they took the typical advertising approach. The working committee of the ministerial council said that it would like to see an alternative to that mainstream advertising approach. Two further names came up. One was also an advertising company and one was a company that used a technique called network marketing. Since only one name came up it would be possible to assume that that company would have an unfair advantage during the final selection process for a contractor to market the DRP if the committee was looking at an alternative marketing approach. The only company nominated was this company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked questions about how the company was chosen. We asked about the method used by the Office of Government Information and Advertising to choose an alternative to the mainstream advertising approach. What it did was insert three key words in a database of 1,500 potential contractors and it selected the name of the company. Then we asked it what it did about vetting this company and whether it had determined whether the company had the capacity to undertake a contract worth $4.9 million. I chased around various estimates committees to find out what happened because nobody seemed to know. The committee that was organising and supervising this contract said that it thought OGIA had done it. What we found out was that it obtained two oral references about the selected company. One of the references was from a government department in New South Wales. It obtained these oral references to see whether the company could undertake this contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One concern we have is that no checks of the financial capabilities of this company were undertaken prior to the contract being awarded. Normally, certain procedures are undertaken to ensure that a company is able to carry out a contract of this size. If the company's last annual return to the Australian Securities Commission had been obtained&mdash;and that is very easy to do&mdash;prior to the letting of the contract and it had been checked, it would have revealed that the company was trading at a loss, that its liabilities exceeded its assets, and it was probably balance sheet insolvent. This is a company to which the government intended to let a contract worth $4.9 million of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A contract was let to this company and this year the company went into liquidation. There were 229 unspecified creditors; some may be associated with other work that the company was doing but some were related to the contract. OGIA has estimated that this work is to the tune of $114,000. When we asked questions about these matters it was also contended that the Commonwealth had no financial responsibility to these unsecured creditors, although it appeared to many of the creditors that the company was working on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases the company used a letterhead with a logo at the top which was also being used by the department, but with a different address. Also, some of the company's officers were working out of Commonwealth offices. Therefore, the creditors considered the company was operating under the umbrella of the Commonwealth. They thought that they were actually negotiating with someone who was doing a job on behalf of the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth says that it has no financial responsibility for these companies that are out of pocket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that is of great concern is that some of those people have disabilities. People with disabilities were contracted by the company to undertake programs to promote the disability reform package. The irony of all this is that this company&mdash;a company which was contracted to promote the disability reform package, to talk about what the government is doing for people with disabilities&mdash;has employed people with disabilities whom it has not paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This contract was being supervised&mdash;and I use that word loosely because of what happened&mdash;in some way by three departments that were represented on the management committee. This committee was responsible for managing the contract. The committee was also attended by someone from OGIA who was chairing that committee but seemed, from what was said in estimates, not to be responsible in terms of the contract itself. So it appeared that the three departments were responsible for managing the contract with OGIA chairing and coordinating it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May-June 1992, a number of meetings were held&mdash;I think some eight meetings in five weeks, but I will not be held to that exact figure&mdash;and there were discussions as to whether the contract should be terminated. Two of the departments said that the contract should be terminated. One department said, `No. We should go on'. If you were in business and had let a contract for $4.95 million, and if along the way you had some grave concerns about the contract and went to the managing director or your shareholders afterwards and had said, `Look, I'm awfully sorry, two out of three decided that we should not go ahead, but we could not reach a consensus so we went on with it', you would not have a job and the shareholders would have you for breakfast. In this case, the taxpayers ought to have questions answered for them. Here was this contract being let and two out of the three departments had expressed grave concern about whether the contract should continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another concern that we raised was that while the contract stipulated that Corporate Impacts, the company that had the contract, be paid on a monthly basis&mdash;that is, $200,000 per month&mdash;all except $62,000 of the $4.95 million designated for the contract had been paid to Corporate Impacts by February 1993. I do not know what the government was going to do between February 1993 and June 1993 when the contract ended, because it only had $62,000 left to pay out of the $4.95 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yet another concern that we expressed was that an officer from OGIA gave evidence that two designated persons to the contract may have mischarged the Commonwealth in excess of $220,000 between them. Another concern raised was that despite the fact that these two designated persons are the directors of another company which, according to form 507 lodged with the Australian Securities Commission by the liquidator, has a damages claim of $1.88 million against Corporate Impacts, the Commonwealth does not seem to have examined this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, an officer from OGIA gave evidence that the network facilitators, the people employed by Corporate Impacts, employed to carry out this contract worked 13,000 fewer head hours than the 55,000 head hours stipulated in the contract. In the face of this nearly all of the contract is paid out; only $62,000 is left of $4.95 million. So one would have assumed that those head hours that were in the contract would have been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A further concern that we raised in the minority report was that form 507 lodged with the Australian Securities Commission by the liquidator of Corporate Impacts indicates that 16 of the network facilitators who were employed by Corporate Impacts to implement its network marketing approach to the DRP contract, which was endorsed by the working committee of the ministerial council, are owed entitlements by Corporate Impacts. So Corporate Impacts owes money to people it employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another concern is that an officer from OGIA gave evidence that one of the directors may have mischarged the Commonwealth for travel costs entailed in the execution of the DRP contract. It was also revealed that to date an undisclosed number of deliverables with an undisclosed value have not been provided to the Commonwealth by Corporate Impacts. It was also revealed in these estimates hearings that in spite of the concerns expressed about the financial viability of Corporate Impacts by the management committee, from November 1992 onwards a further contract of $29,500 was awarded by the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories to Corporate Impacts in April 1993. That was a matter of weeks prior to its application for voluntary liquidation in May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An issue of grave concern is that an officer of OGIA has questioned the objectivity of the liquidator appointed to Corporate Impacts. The Commonwealth's concerns about the execution of its contract are of such gravity that it is currently considering legal action. Evidence was provided in another estimates committee that a company contracted by the Commonwealth to evaluate this contract was threatened by Corporate Impacts with legal action resulting in delay of the evaluation report. I have seen the draft report and I must admit that from that evaluation it does not seem that the problem was all Corporate Impacts' way. The evaluation says that there had been a recommendation that a director or coordinator be appointed to liaise with Corporate Impacts and the three departments. That apparently was never done. Had that happened, some of these problems may have been ironed out&mdash;I doubt that all of them would have been ironed out, but who is responsible?  I kept asking the minister:  where does the buck stop?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the officers told their respective ministers that they had concerns about the contract and how it was progressing, but nothing seemed to be done. Senator McMullan had some responsibility and nothing seemed to be done on his part. So the situation is just dragging on. I admit that it was an unusual contract; it went across a number of departments with OGIA chairing it, and that meant that some issues could slip between the stools. But people went to their ministers and said, `We have grave concerns' and yet nothing was done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern was that evidence was provided in another estimates committee that a former member of the management committee that managed the contract is taking legal action against Corporate Impacts and its principal arising out of allegations made about him in the context of the DRP contract which he considers to be defamatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A further concern that we raised is that evidence provided in another estimates committee shows that it has cost two of the three departments represented on the management committee&mdash;namely, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services&mdash;over $247,000 and in excess of 9,900 staff hours to supervise this contract. During the estimates hearings an officer from OGIA described this contract as having `always been a troublesome, difficult relationship&mdash;more and more troublesome as it has gone on'. So we not only have to consider the cost of the contract; we have also to consider almost a quarter of a million dollars expended in staff time and administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern that was expressed was that evidence provided by officers appearing before Estimates Committee D and another estimates committee indicates that there is a lack of clear guidelines stipulating who has responsibility for checking the bona fides of a contractor when a contractor crosses a number of Commonwealth agencies. We saw that this was not done. This company was not investigated appropriately, as most other companies would be before such a large contract was let. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern was that evidence provided by officers appearing before this committee and another estimates committee indicates that there is a lack of clear guidelines for the procurement of marketing and advertising related services. So there are two problems&mdash;one when there is a crossing across departments and the other when what is being procured is not equipment or tangibles. There are not clear guidelines for procurement of marketing and advertising related services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern expressed was that evidence provided by officers appearing before this and another estimates committee indicates that there is a lack of clear guidelines outlining how decisions relating to the management of the contract are made if the contract crosses across a number of Commonwealth agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall concern for me is that the aim of this project was to publicise the government's changes in disability reform when, really, the people who have lost out in this are people with disabilities. They have not been served well. In terms of the outcome of this contract, the evaluation is not as favourable as it might have been if it had not had all the problems that have been associated with it. More people&mdash;more doctors, more employers, more carers&mdash;would have known about the government's program to encourage people with disabilities into open employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the issue that I raised earlier. There are people with disabilities who are unpaid creditors. I find that ironical. I cannot believe that we had a contract for $4.95 million and the company was not investigated properly beforehand. That was atrocious. Every taxpayer ought to be concerned about that. I hope that the lessons we have learnt through the letting of this contract&mdash;the problems associated with crossing departments, the problems associated with crossing agencies and the problems associated with the procurement of advertising and marketing services&mdash;are addressed by the government so that we do not find a farce like this again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is a farce. Two officers from two departments thought we should stop the contract. Because one was not happy about it and there was not consensus, nothing was done about it. I think that the ministers ought to ask questions about their responsibility. I have asked questions about their responsibility and where the buck stops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a Senate committee ought to give further consideration to the issues, which I have outlined in the report, of the letting of the DRP contract, the management of the contract and, specifically, why advice from two of three departments on the management committee that the DRP contract be terminated was ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a committee should also investigate debts owed to unsecured creditors from the DRP contract, look at the possibility of the mischarging of the Commonwealth by Corporate Impacts, examine the allegations that have been made about the objectivity of the liquidator, examine why a further contract was let to Corporate Impacts in April 1993 although the Commonwealth must have had significant doubts about the company's financial viability, examine what sorts of mechanisms are put in place so that a department is aware of companies with whom other departments are currently having problems, and also examine the effectiveness of current purchasing guidelines. I express concern that Senator Coates did not see fit to address the issue in more detail in the majority report. I commend the minority report to honourable senators. </PARA>

They ignored a whole lot of other evidence that was put before the committee and they misrepresented a whole lot of the evidence&mdash;even the evidence that they let themselves hear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular I want to refer to the Department of Finance issue. Once again we had opposition senators saying, as they have been saying over and over for some months, that the Department of Finance has said that this particular lease should only have a one per cent escalator clause in it. Of course, the fact is that the Department of Finance has had no involvement at all with this lease. There is nothing to show that the Department of Finance has made any judgment at all about this lease and the appropriate escalator clause in it. It has not said that this lease should have one per cent compared to the nine per cent that was negotiated and was recommended as appropriate by those from whom the audit office took advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Finance's one per cent applies because that is the standard escalator that is used all around the country. As the finance department said in its evidence, if it were to have had anything different from the standard one per cent, it would have had to look at the lease in more detail and had an actual case put to it. The one per cent applies because the Department of Finance did not investigate the matter any further. The one per cent is based on overall rental arrangements all around the country&mdash;not just Canberra and certainly not just the Barton area, which is accepted as being one of the highest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad, but also annoying, that the evidence about the Department of Finance's involvement keeps being ignored by the opposition. The Auditor-General himself said to the committee that he was not aware of a number of things, although I think he was talking personally rather than in relation to all people in his office, because obviously there were people in the audit office dealing with the matter with the Australian Property Group, the Australian Valuation Office and, in relation to the resource agreement, the Department of Finance. Of course, the resource agreement was to do with the overall issue of the resources for the audit office. There seems to have been some misunderstanding, at least on the part of the Auditor-General, as to what was being signed when there were agreements with Finance about that resource agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I could deal with a whole lot of other issues relating to the contributions to this debate from those opposite, if there is one thing that I can get across and ask them to believe&mdash;if they will only read the evidence&mdash;it should be that the Department of Finance has not said that this lease should only have a one per cent escalator; the Department of Finance has made no judgment about it whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating cognately the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 and the Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993. I intend to split my contribution to the debate on these bills into five parts: the industrial relations court; the boycott provisions; reform of the Australian industrial relations system; lack of consultation; and the use of conventions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to deal principally with the reform bill as the remuneration bill only provides for salaries of judges appointed to the industrial relations court. As we are opposing the establishment of the industrial relations court under part 7 of the reform bill, we will also be opposing the remuneration bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debate on the establishment of a specialist industrial relations court has been around for some 25 years. The last occasion was during the debate on the Industrial Relations Bill 1987, which was aborted by the Hawke-Labor government. By the time the Industrial Relations Bill was reintroduced in 1988, the High Court had determined that the industrial division of the Federal Court did have the authority to make determinations on industrial relations matters. Therefore, the government did not proceed in this direction. I refer honourable members on the other side of the chamber to what the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, had to say at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing has changed since 1988. The opposition has not been able to find any valid reasons that this court should be established and the minister has not even attempted to justify the need for it. On that basis, there is no justification for the establishment of this specialist industrial relations court which will make already complicated legal systems even more complex. One could well also mention the additional costs of putting another court in place and how much it would cost taxpayers. The Law Council of Australia spelt it out clearly to the Senate committee. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No reason is given why the Federal Court could not exercise the jurisdiction, even the new jurisdiction, proposed for the Industrial Relations Court. There is no suggestion that the Federal Court has not performed effectively in its Industrial Division.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition will be moving an amendment to part 7 of the reform bill to delete all reference to the industrial relations court to ensure that the Federal Court of Australia continues to have jurisdiction for industrial relations matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to address is the boycott provisions at part 6 of the bill. The opposition totally rejects the changes to the boycott provisions, as does every employer organisation in the country, and we will be moving to delete part 6 of the bill. In cases such as Mudginberri, Dollar Sweets, Columbus Shipping Line, the live sheep export dispute and the boycotting of our mining industry, the main protection for industry has been the secondary boycott provisions of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. They have worked and worked extremely successfully. Under this bill, they have been diluted to such an extent that they will be useless both as a threat against taking illegal or irresponsible action and as an option for obtaining speedy resolution to disputes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new 72-hour rule is just a licence to damage business going about its legal activity. The situation was best expressed to the committee by two comments, the first by Dr Blain, an adviser from the Western Australian government. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we very much support the thrust of what you are saying, that is, we very much support the retention of the existing provisions for 45D and 45E. I think an important part of the rationale for our support is what we would call the threat effect. I think this is what you were alluding to, perhaps in different words. The fact that it has not been used on a large number of occasions is not the major point. The major point is that it is there to be used if the situation requires.</PARA>
<PARA>The second comment, by Mr Barry Watchorn of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, relates to the 72-hour rule. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you are looking at a regime in which there is a theoretical 72 hour window of opportunity, albeit that the commission can cut short, where boycott action can bite on an employer. There are cases in which 72 hours can be extremely damaging, certainly for those involved in organising exhibitions. And dare I say it, in such extravaganzas as the current Madonna series of concerts, 72 hours could be too long for any of that.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact that political boycotts will now legally return without any protection in the Trade Practices Act is unfortunate and will mean that industry in this country will be very severely damaged and could well move offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area I wish to deal with is reform of the industrial relations system in Australia. This bill will go down in history as an opportunity lost. This bill is an unmitigated disaster. Let us look at the intent and the result. To do so, we should recall what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised in his speech of 21 April. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. It is a model under which compulsory arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases will be there only as a safety net. This safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employees.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same speech the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want it to be close to 100 per cent of employees under federal awards.</PARA>
<PARA>The question now becomes: will the legislation fulfil the Prime Minister's statement? If the evidence given to the Senate committee in most of the submissions and from a vast majority of witnesses is any guide, the answer is a categorical no. For example, Mr Vernon Winley, assistant director of the Business Council of Australia, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our view is that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill misses the opportunity to introduce real reform into the industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, during the committee hearings Mr Bryan Noakes of ACCI was asked whether this delivers what the Prime Minister promised. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, it does not, not in the least.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's vision for industrial relations reform pivoted on a massive expansion of workplace or enterprise agreements, on productivity improvements and resultant increases in employment opportunities. But that vision, which may have been able to be achieved, was hijacked by the ACTU. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, all that was achieved was to make already complex procedures more complex and difficult to satisfy, even in the relatively simple certified agreements area. This was best illustrated to the committee by Mr Reg Hamilton of ACCI who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second issue I wish to raise relates to paragraph 7 at page 3 of our written submission, where we indicate that the new certified agreement provisions add some eight new tests.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems the count has gone up. We are now advised that there are an additional two tests, so that should read that the new certified agreement provisions add some 10 new tests to the existing provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for simplification and making it easier!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of enterprise flexibility agreements covering employers and non-union employees, the situation is even worse. In fact, when asked if this legislation would be an impediment to improving employment in the small business sector, Mr Robert Bastian of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From my understanding of it and from what I believe to be the average small employer's understanding of it, unquestionably yes.</PARA>
<PARA>The more one delves into this bill, the more obvious it becomes that it is a step backwards, not a step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter I wish to address is the lack of consultation. Mr Brereton claims he consulted widely. Let us look at the response to this claim. In doing so, I acknowledge that he or his department did table the number of meetings that were held with various groups, but it is worth noting that a number of speeches made at conferences and the like were included in the meetings with employers or employer organisations. I refer to an extract from the submission made by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to the Senate committee. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of developing the bill was inappropriate and not in accordance with a tripartite approach. The framework for the bill was developed by bipartite discussions with the ACTU through a negotiating committee on which ACCI was not represented.</PARA>
<PARA>Nor, might I add, was any other employer or employer organisation. Later in the same submission, ACCI stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No agreed positions were reached, no policy proposals were put to employers in writing, and ACCI received no response to its comprehensive written submissions forwarded to the Government in May. No written advice of any kind was received from the Government until after it had reached agreement with the ACTU, and on no occasion has ACCI been formally provided with a copy of that agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>This view was consistently put by all employer representatives. What has emerged is a lopsided bill which gives increased power to the trade union movement; it does not provide equity between the various parties. This was best expressed by the National Farmers Federation which, like others, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, we do not think it provides equity between the parties.</PARA>
<PARA>An analysis of the submissions from 27 individuals and organisations received by the Senate standing committee on this bill, shows just how widespread opposition to the bill is. Submissions from the ALP governments of South Australia and the ACT and the one from the ACTU were the only cases of support without reservation. The Queensland Labor government, while expressing support, expressed reservation about the intrusiveness of the bill with regard to states rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One submission thought the ILO related provisions for workers with family responsibilities were too narrow. Another submission, from the Coal Association, did not address the terms of reference but made some very valid points about its unique industrial relations position with regard to the Coal Industry Tribunal, which no doubt will be debated at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining 20 submissions&mdash;that is 20 out of 27&mdash;all expressed opposition to the legislation for a variety of reasons, including concern that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill would not achieve its stated aims; union bias; reduced employer legal powers, especially the secondary boycott provisions; the use of external affairs powers; the complexity of enterprise agreement procedures; and the unnecessary duplication of existing legal procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the consultation had been balanced, there is little chance that equitable legislation would have been drafted when it is noted that 27&mdash;or about 25 per cent&mdash;of all federal Labor members and senators list as an occupation before entering parliament paid or senior representational positions with a trade union or trades and labour councils. It is clear that the consultation process was lopsided. In fact, one can only conclude that employers were delivered a fait accompli to fiddle at the edges. The dissenting report's principal recommendation that the bill should be returned to the minister is absolutely valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area which I find disturbing&mdash;and the last one I have time to address today&mdash;is the increasing tendency of the federal government to justify its legislative program by using ILO and United Nations conventions, and to impose the intent of them on states by application of the foreign affairs powers. In the case of this legislation, the inclusion by annexure of ILO and United Nations conventions has reached new heights and, as far as we can ascertain, for the first time we have witnessed the use of ILO recommendations which carry no legislative weight and which, in some instances, are contrary to the provisions contained in the relevant convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another worry is the inclusion in the bill of ILO convention 135 on workers' representatives, which was ratified by the Keating government on 26 February 1993 and which will have no effect on Australian law until 12 months have elapsed since ratification. This ratification was contrary to the guidelines laid down by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to the effect that initiatives of this nature should not be undertaken during an election period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this government is too lazy and incompetent to introduce its own legislation program. It relies on bad information provided domestically by the likes of the ACTU or, internationally, by the ILO&mdash;in both instances, sources with barrows of their own to push. The Keating government is hiding behind the skirts of international government by using the foreign affairs power in a manner which was never intended. By this means, legislation has been enacted which has profound effects on federal and state jurisdictions without proper debate in the federal parliament or between the federal and state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government ignores the mandate given to the state governments to reform industrial relations, particularly in Victoria and Western Australia&mdash;and it is worth looking at the recent survey with regard to industrial relations reform in Victoria. Instead, it uses a sledgehammer approach with the use of the external affairs power to impose its own will on those states which maintain their legislative independence and continue to resist pressure from the ACTU or the TLCs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal Labor is quite open in this regard. The minister's second reading speech in the House of Representatives and his colleague's speech here use the same words. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In States where the standards, as outlined in the legislation, are adequately met, the federal provisions will not apply.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we see from this legislation that we could well have the situation whereby, because the words in the Queensland and federal legislation are similar in that the minimum wage is set by an arbitrated mechanism, but that of Western Australia is set by the minister on a recommendation from the Western Australian Industrial Arbitration Commission, the minimum wage in Western Australia could be higher than that in Queensland while being illegal or not accepted under this legislation. If anyone can think of anything crazier than that, I do not know what it can be. The Senate should amend the bill's title and call it the `Trade Unions Sanctions and Power Enhancement Guarantee Bill 1993', because that is what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the bill's SCEET hearings, witnesses were asked about their comprehension of the bill. It was best summed up by Mr Robert Bastian of COSBOA who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I say over and over again that we do not understand the full ramifications of this bill. Nobody does. That is point one. I stress again that the smaller end of things is where employment is really occurring and where this bill seems, in my view, to land most harshly. Quite frankly, the government is not much further advanced than I am in terms of approaching the back of a TV set with a screwdriver. I just do not think we know what we are playing with here. My strongest counsel would be to say not to ram this thing through in the next couple of weeks, let the debate run for as long as it takes to get a clearer picture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am repeating myself. We know that the reversal of direction has been wrought by the very forces that we are frightened of.</PARA>
<PARA>When the bill was introduced in the House of Representatives, the minister indicated that there would be a number of technical and other amendments. We have already seen 177 amendments and no doubt more will be introduced here. Whether we like it or not, we are going to be debating this bill and subsequent bills to correct errors, resulting from inadequate drafting instructions, and unforeseen consequences for many months, if not years, not to mention the bad policy behind this legislation. Quite simply, the bill is not ready for debate. It is wasting our valuable time. It has not been prepared with any equity in mind and it will not achieve its intended objectives, even to the extent that the existing act, left in place unaltered, would achieve more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, the coalition does not support any aspects of this bill and accordingly will be voting against it. Certainly in my 3 1/2 years in this parliament I have never seen so much anger and concern expressed by such a wide spread of the community with regard to a piece of legislation. That has come through the committee hearings we have had, through personal comments, through meetings that I have attended and through my fax machine today. I hope that I am not the only one receiving faxes in this place, but I have received more than 300 letters from concerned small businesses today expressing their frustration and concern that this legislation will inhibit their ability to perform and their ability to expand their operations, employ more people and address some aspects of the unemployment problem that we have in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe&mdash;and nor does the rest of the coalition&mdash;that this bill will improve the unemployment situation. It will be another encumbrance on businesses, which will exacerbate the problem. I will quote from a letter I have selected from the pile I have received. The first one says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plumbers use `unions' for joining pipes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other sorts of unions need to remain limited by law so that small businesses can contribute to the national income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Senator, you are obliged to prevent legislation detrimental to this nation. We request that you use your power to stop this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other letters are similar. What I can do is raise the issues in this place. I appeal to the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Harradine to recognise that there is a whole group of people in our community who feel totally aggrieved by the federal government's approach to industrial relations. The government certainly has no mandate for what it is doing as a result of the last election. It should stop pandering to the ACTU and look at serving the national interest. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The second of these bills is a machinery matter and relates to remuneration for judges. It is part of the reform package. I will say very little about that bill. I will confine my remarks essentially to the reform package itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a feeling of great pride in being associated with the Labor government which has championed legislation such as this. I am proud that in my first year as a Labor senator and as a member of the Australian Labor Party I am able to support the introduction of legislation of this type which redresses many of the imbalances that working people in this country have faced for many years. The bill provides a minimum safety net for all workers throughout Australia, no matter what state they live in. The bill in many respects highlights the very basic divisions that exist between the major political parties in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) in his second reading speech indicated that no legislative package could ever hope to satisfy the competing views of all groups with an interest in industrial relations. What is encouraging, he said, is that he had found throughout his consultations a measure of consensus on the need for reform of the kind that we are proposing, although there is obviously discord on the detail of how it should be achieved. For its part, the government believes that the proposals strike the right balance between enhancing flexibility and ensuring an adequate safety net of employee protection. The right balance has been something that Labor governments have been seeking to achieve since 1983, when this government came to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic principles of Labor's industrial relations policy assume partnership. They assume a notion that all aspects of the work force&mdash;be it business, be it unions, be it workers or be it government&mdash;can work together. They assume that through enterprise bargaining the government is able to initiate policy frameworks that devolve that partnership approach to the enterprise level and achieve workplace flexibility and productivity growth without sacrificing the basic rights and conditions of Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new stream of enterprise bargaining will allow even greater flexibility and open new ways for both the lightly unionised and the heavily unionised workplaces to enact change. It is a partnership which is recognised in this bill. It recognises that industrial relations legislation must be based on striking the balance and delivering fairness. At the current time the arguments concerning this package revolve around the appropriate mix of flexibility and protection. Some employer organisations argued before the Senate standing committee, as Senator Crane has indicated, that the maintenance of a compulsory award system reduces flexibility. This was not the view supported by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Supporters of the bill argue that a cooperative relationship between employee and employer would improve flexibility and productivity as workers negotiate in an atmosphere free from fear. These divisions between the various state governments on this issue highlight the very basic difference that exists between the various political parties in this country. The Labor government in South Australia supported the thrust of the bill and saw it as a positive step, while the submission from the Victorian government was critical of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report presented to the Senate dealt with the bill's implications for the states in regard to states' rights and responsibilities. The report found that the bill would enable the Commonwealth to use its external affairs and corporations powers to underpin laws dealing with industrial relations. After listening to a range of state government objections, the committee was satisfied that, where a state had appropriate and adequate standards regarding minimum entitlements, the jurisdiction will remain within that state. This is certainly not the case in regard to Victoria and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that, in regard to the provision of enterprise flexibility agreements, only those covered by federal awards will be covered by the new legislation. We see the flood of workers from Victoria seeking federal award coverage for the very reasons that this bill highlights&mdash;the need to protect basic human rights and industrial decency. The Senate committee report stated quite clearly that the fears expressed by some regarding the intrusion on states' rights are more imagined than real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the aims of the bill as distinct from some of the hysteria that we have heard. The industrial relations system we have before us has three basic goals. It aims to promote productivity in workplaces and ensure efficiency in industry and, therefore, economic growth and prosperity for the community as a whole. It aims to ensure the quality of working life for workers arising from a cooperative relationship between workers and their employers. It aims to ensure the recognition that workers do not have equal bargaining power with their employers to prevent exploitation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present economic climate it has to be appreciated that high unemployment is a weapon used by some employers to force down wages and conditions. Leaving workers and their employers to deal directly with each other without any support from state safety nets would be forcing workers back into the worst excesses of the industrial revolution. We would be left with the unequal relationship of master and servant. Those who support the deregulation of the labour market seem only interested in one aspect of flexibility, and that is flexibility downwards for wages and conditions for working people. This is the sort of bargaining position that has been epitomised by the champion of the New Right in Victoria, Mr Peter Boyle, whose infamous statement `make them fear the sack' rings very loud in the ears of many workers throughout this country. It has become the way of industrial relations for many in Victoria. It is the sort of approach that the coalition, as we have just heard, supports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach would completely work against the three goals that I have already indicated tonight. It would do nothing to enhance productivity and certainly nothing to promote cooperation. It would serve to perpetuate and encourage exploitation. This government, on the other hand, through the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, is committed to a system which recognises the unequal bargaining power between workers and their employees and which provides a framework of minimum standards within the process of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Any industrial relations system must establish minimum standards; otherwise the law of the jungle would apply. But any such minima must be reasonable and comprehensive. They should be capable of being relied upon; otherwise their existence is fanciful and provides no real protection. The Australian community supports the award system which has been in place in this country throughout this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation accepts awards as setting the minimum wages and conditions for the great majority of workers in this country. This is fair and appropriate. Those minima can then form the basis of agreements entered into at workshop level to provide greater flexibility and productivity as well as additional benefits for working people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can be compared with the unfair and unjust approach to minimum standards that we see in my home state of Victoria where basic minima include: four weeks additional annual leave for each year worked after a year has been worked and no pro rata entitlements; one week's sick leave for each year worked after a year has been worked and no pro rata entitlements; an hourly rate of pay equal to the base award rate for the classification of employee as at the time the act commenced. Of course, recently in Victoria special legislation has had to be introduced to try to provide the basic minimum award entitlement to an $8 increase that the arbitration commission recently granted because acts instituted by the Victorian state government clearly are not capable of being able to cope with such situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other minimum requirement is 52 weeks unpaid parental and adoption leave and a right to work part time with employer's agreement for two years after the adoption or birth of a child. These basic conditions enacted by the Victorian Employee Relations Act are substantially inferior to the conditions enjoyed by workers under awards&mdash;that is, both federal and other states' awards. The Victorian government does not even argue that these conditions are sufficient to protect workers. In its submission to the Senate committee investigating the bill, it merely emphasised that those conditions are minimal only. Heaven help people who are forced to rely upon them!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because workers in Victoria no longer have access to compulsory arbitration that this federal legislation provides additional protection through extending minimum standards through international conventions. The provisions in this bill giving the federal commission power to set minimum wages are especially important for Victorian workers where the Victorian government has sought to abolish awards. I might add that this will also be of enormous benefit to Western Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the first avenue of these workers will be to seek federal award coverage. That process is already under way and will be enhanced by the amendments to section 111 of the act contained in this legislative package. Thereafter, a second avenue of redress will be to seek an order from the federal commission with respect to appropriate wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy that Victorian workers are in fact second class citizens when it comes to industrial relations and are to an extent reliant upon the provisions that have been enacted by the Victorian parliament. It is clear from the Victorian government's own figures that the great majority of Victorian workers are now seeking to remain on awards or remain covered by their former award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Victorian government's submission to the Senate committee, of the 1.9 million employed persons in Victoria, only 210,000 have reached individual employment contracts&mdash;a measly 11 per cent. There are far fewer collective agreements&mdash;only 158. Given the secrecy surrounding the agreements, it is difficult to know the number of employees covered by them. We can only estimate that it is just a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a minuscule number of collective agreements and 11 per cent of workers forced to bargain individually with their employees&mdash;probably it is a `take it or leave it' proposition&mdash;and with no public scrutiny to ensure that there is no disadvantage test. The greatest protection of this particular provision in this package of legislation is the provision of the no disadvantage test. This provides great reassurance to workers embarked on any process of change and reform at the workplace level. The absence of such a test is the greatest injustice under the Victorian system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the questions of unfair dismissal and equal pay, which are two other aspects of this bill. Here again we can see that Victorians are at a clear disadvantage when compared with workers in other states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a proposition where the national Labor government is intent on forging a partnership between workers, employers and government. This is in contrast to the approach of the opposition, which is content to rely on its old-fashioned 19th century notions of master and servant relationships. In recent years, that partnership approach has been extended to the workplace through enterprise bargaining, achieving greater flexibility and productivity without sacrificing the basic rights and conditions of Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach has been to promote fairness in the relationship between workers and employers. It has fostered the participation of workers in the process of workplace reform. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill would promote an open and accountable system which is clearly in sharp contrast to the actions that have been undertaken by the reactionary elements of the new right governments in various states of this Commonwealth. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of the legislation is to facilitate the spread of enterprise bargaining within the federal system of industrial relations; create a limited right to strike by modifying the operation of statutory and common law sanctions on industrial action, and thus comply with our treaty obligations regarding ILO conventions; and guarantee certain minimum standards of employment to all Australian workers. At the same time, the legislation will result in the strengthening of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The legislation will increase the ability of the IRC to ensure that awards are relevant, that equal pay is made real and available to all and that all Australians are protected against unfair dismissals. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Questions were also raised about the compatibility of the convention and Australia's ILO treaty obligations with the boycott provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1991, mirroring sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act; essential services legislation in New South Wales, the Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria and South Australia; and other federal legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, 40 years ago when I was an apprentice. I was the clerk of a chapel&mdash;`clerk' meaning secretary, in case anybody gets that position confused with those held by the clerks in this place; and `chapel' referring to a union organisation in a printing factory. I wrote a letter to the employer because the tradesmen were seeking a wage increase of #2. The employer panicked. He went to his employers' association, which was aware of the penal provisions of the Arbitration Act of the fifties. Immediately, I became the head of the match, as they say, and, under the arbitration rules at that time, the innocent, straightforward letter that I had written became a letter of demand. Of course, a move was made to go to the Industrial Relations Commission. This was enterprise bargaining 40 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no time flat, the employer believed what his association had to say&mdash;employers' associations have not changed much over the years; they are the same today&mdash;and we had a serious situation for a relatively small factory of about 30 people. As a teenager, I was threatened with the penal clauses. I was defended, of course, by my union. But I had few rights because the law, as has always been the case, favoured the employer. This legislation brings fairness to the situation and makes possible proper enterprise negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, I might mention that I spent the rest of my apprenticeship under pressure from my employer. People on the other side of the chamber do not know what it is like to spend years under pressure and having everything one does watched and checked. It went further. My indentures were threatened by the employer and there was pressure on my parents. So I was schooled at an early age about the penal provisions of the Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very glad to be here today to see the provisions being altered. My employer was a good employer; he was not a bad person. Even as a teenager I could see that we were each playing roles, but the system was wrong because it was unfair. Enterprise bargaining will become much fairer as a result of the changes proposed in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I became a union official and, finally, secretary of a union. I could talk for some time, but I will not, of the cases I have come across where so many people have been victimised or injured in their employment because of the subtle, and the not so subtle, pressures. People have been tramped from their employment because they have acted as representatives of employees. This legislation changes the system that we have followed until now and gives us a chance of moving into a situation that will be much fairer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support this legislation because it seeks to implement a whole range of protections, based on international labour standards, for minimum wages, workers with family responsibility, unpaid parental leave and termination rights. I support this legislation because it maintains the award system. The coalition does not like that because it is fair. The coalition lost the election in March because people see it as a fair system and they want to work within that fair system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill contains a number of amendments aimed at maintaining and strengthening the award system with the commission given responsibility to ensure secure, relevant and consistent wages and conditions of employment. The award framework will be maintained so that it provides an effective safety net underpinning direct bargaining while having proper regard to the interests of the parties and the wider community. In determining safety net increases in wages and conditions through test cases, for example, public interest considerations will continue to be particularly important. While the emphasis is on a consistent framework of minimum award rates, provision is made for paid rates awards to continue and be maintained in areas where employees have customarily had access to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that I particularly commend this legislation for is the position of women workers and their gains under this legislation. I particularly welcome the legislation because it supports those who are most vulnerable in workplace bargaining&mdash;that is, women workers in traditionally female dominated industries. Historically, women have been located in the weakest and less unionised sectors of the labour force. Despite this, however, Australian workers have achieved one of the smallest gender wages gaps in the world. Because of our award system, historically, rises won by fitters eventually flowed to child-care workers and shop assistants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation proposes reforms which will maintain and strengthen the award system. This can only be considered advantageous to women workers. At the same time, this legislation supports the other factor which has aided women's relative position in the work force&mdash;that is, unionism. I make no apology for it because the facts are very clear: workers in weak bargaining positions, such as women, need the presence of a union, particularly during enterprise bargaining. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill seeks to assure employees that their conditions will be protected by the no disadvantage clause, which is the key to that in this legislation, and by the fact that unions have a right to be involved in enterprise agreements. If I have time I will refer to some of the letters I have received from some of the more fringe elements of employers' organisations who cannot stand having an equal relationship with their employees. Their letters indicate that they want to stand over people who are in a weakened position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important part of the government's attempt to extend enterprise agreements because unionism protects women more than it protects men. Gross exploitation of workers occurs in non-unionised female areas. In Australia unionised men earn 8.5 per cent more than non-unionised men but unionised women earn 25 per cent more than non-unionised women. Of course, the state Liberal governments have given us tremendous examples of that. If people from South Australia, particularly women, are listening to this broadcast tonight, I say to them: make sure that you do not make a mistake when you come to elect a state government because in every case the Liberal Party in power in state governments has given advantage to the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey of enterprise bargains under the New South Wales Act in my own state show that unions protect hours of work. Union agreements provided for 35- to 38-hour weeks in 85 per cent of cases, whereas only half of non-union agreements provided for less than 40 hours. Unions protect all conditions better. Ninety-three per cent of unions have superannuation, whereas only 75 per cent of non-unionists do. It was a similar case with annual leave loading where the figures were 89 per cent and 68 per cent. With sick leave the figures were 90 per cent and 67 per cent and with long service leave the figures were 85 per cent and 52 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that I anticipate other people might raise in this debate relates to unionised workplaces. It is not true that the majority of workers are in non-unionised workplaces. At least 77 per cent of employees in organisations with 20 or more employees are in unionised workplaces&mdash;in other words, where there is a unionist working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time that I have left I wish to endorse my position by quoting an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 2 December written by Sigrid Kirk, headed `Women the big losers in enterprise pay deals'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Almost 80 per cent of enterprise deals which delivered a wage increase to workers were male agreements, 18 per cent were female and 4.5 per cent were mixed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Industrial Relations Court (Judges' Remuneration) Bill 1993 and particularly on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. This bill aims to set rules for the relationship between employers and employees, principally for the 30 per cent of the private sector which is unionised. How should we judge this bill? Should it be judged on the intricacies of the industrial relations world, which very few people understand, or should it be judged on the impact it will have on the lives of most Australians? I believe it should be judged on the latter. It is in that context that I want to address my remarks tonight. This bill needs to be looked at in the context of how the Australian economy works and the need for high economic growth within this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years, Australia has experienced poor economic growth relative to the rest of the world. We have been slipping backwards for a long time&mdash;over and above the recession we had to have of recent years. We need sustained high economic growth, if only to look at what we need to do for the disadvantaged&mdash;the one million unemployed, the half million or so underemployed. What sort of future are we offering our children? We need sustained high economic growth. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, we are currently experiencing growth at the rate of about three per cent. We need economic growth at the rate of five per cent or higher. The three per cent is being achieved because there is a lot of spare capacity in the Australian economy. When that is used up, our growth will tend to stall. The key to understanding long-term sustained economic growth is investment. We need to understand where investment comes from, who makes the decisions. Without investment, there will be no long-term sustained growth. Take this one single fact: the past two years have seen the lowest level of investment in plant and equipment in this economy since World War II&mdash;less than six per cent. Instead of being less than six per cent, it should be up to a level of eight or 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need most businesses&mdash;after all, there are more than 800,000 businesses in Australia&mdash;to look to expand, and they have to do that via investment. That is where new jobs come from. We need lots of people who want to invest and start up new businesses. Again, that is where new jobs come from. What do those people with existing businesses or those looking to form new businesses do? They look outwardly at the world from within this Australian economy and they ask the question: `Can I make a reasonable return on this investment? Can I make a quid on this investment?' What are the risks involved in making investments? Why is it that the rate of investment is so low in this country right now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental question before us tonight is: what does this industrial relations bill do to encourage investment in Australia? Does it help anybody? Does it encourage anybody to invest? The answers to these questions are clear and unequivocal. If we look at the evidence that has been put before various committees going back many years&mdash;the evidence that has been encouraged by this government, the evidence contained in key reports this government has commissioned&mdash;we see there is no question that one of the key things that needs to be done in this economy is to free up the labour market for more flexibility. Without that, businesses will not expand and wealth will not be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If enacted, this bill will, firstly, add further impediments to business. It will discourage investment because it produces further hurdles against employers and employees getting together and making businesses work more productively. Secondly, it will strengthen the award system when we should be getting away from that and towards true enterprise agreements. Thirdly, it waters down the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Fourthly, it introduces much greater complexity to an already unwieldy system that not many people understand. Fifthly, it discourages investment by creating greater uncertainty in the business world. </PARA>

The opposition, on the one hand, purports to say that workers will have a system that is fair and equitable and workers will have a capacity to sit down with their employers and negotiate arrangements for the future of their employment and, on the other hand, it purports to say that we will strengthen the very stick that employers need to beat the workers around the head.

Senator Gibson knows this because he came from an industry that was very much in need of establishing itself in a competitive way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation before the chamber at the moment seeks to deal with industrial relations and not the kind of rubbish or diatribe that flows from some people on the other side. Enterprise bargaining does a number of things. For the first time in the history of industrial relations in this country it will provide the opportunity for non-union shops to have enterprise agreements registered with the Industrial Relations Commission. Opposition members and a number of employer groups have claimed that allowing a union which is a respondent to an award, and through which an enterprise agreement may be sought to be made, to turn up to the Industrial Relations Commission and put an argument with respect to the particular agreement&mdash;whether for or against it&mdash;is a real problem and, in fact, will stop employers from seeking to register agreements.

I am quite sure that unions will not seek to turn up every time an agreement is put before the commission. There is one very good reason why they will not necessarily need to do that&mdash;that is, this industrial relations legislation contains within it a process that provides for the no disadvantage test, and the commission can only register agreements that meet the requirements of the no disadvantage test. So there will be no necessity for unions to turn up on a daily, monthly or any other basis, because they will have access to such agreements after they are registered anyway. So this fear, which is being fuelled by the opposition, is quite unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from the other side that this bill will create further unemployment and a lack of investment, but the fact of the matter is that it adds to the security of employment of workers. It provides a balance to make sure that workers are not unfairly dismissed or unfairly treated. One important aspect&mdash;and we have all heard over a long period about the savings of individual people in this country&mdash;is that if the industrial relations policy of the opposition were now being implemented as legislation, we would lose the award superannuation that has been granted to workers. That is a very important aspect of personal savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite amazed at the continual statements that somehow this legislation, both current and proposed, has some capacity to affect investment. Senator Gibson is nodding his head. Those opposite say, `There will be less investment if we have this legislation'. I have yet to hear any statement from that side as to why that would be the case. There is one reason that investment occurs in any business, and that is a provision that the business has some capacity to sell whatever it produces. If it is a restaurant selling coffee, it has to have customers. That is the one fundamental thing that this country needs. Do honourable senators know why? Because we had almost 32 years of conservative government that rode on the sheep's back and did nothing else; it did nothing about manufacturing. But for the past 10 years this government has been dealing with the real issue that will affect investment in this country; it has been redeveloping the manufacturing industry of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended a very important dinner the other night for the textile, clothing and footwear industry. I have heard all the rhetoric from the other side with respect to how we have decimated the industry. That industry has redefined itself and is redesigning itself to meet the challenges of the future, and it will do so successfully. That is where employment will ultimately come from. It will not come from some mickey mouse industrial relations policy that those opposite would like to see us have. All they are about is reducing employment and employees' wages and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is how they see the impact on investment. They have provided nothing else, not one thing, not one piece of evidence, to support the rhetoric that they continually provide to this chamber about how the industrial relations proposals of this government will reduce investment.

I have to say that the trade union movement has contributed more in that respect than any member of the opposition. That is quite clearly the case.

That is what those opposite were going to give kids who were trying to put themselves through school. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we are debating the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which is in fact a payback bill. It is a payback to the ACTU for running a scare campaign at the last election&mdash;at the expense of its own members and without their permission&mdash;on behalf of its political arm, the ALP. Like the mafia, the ACTU has come back to collect, with interest. It was also an election that was a win for the ACTU-ALP, but a mighty loss for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to honourable senators that the ACTU vice-president, Jennie George, reminded Bryan Noakes of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian public when she said on television, `We'&mdash;the ACTU&mdash;`won the election'. I do not recall Jennie George standing as a candidate; neither do I recall Jennie George being elected. But she said, `We won the election'. Surely there is a message in there somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators might recall that a few years ago, to cope with falling membership in what is called the post-industrial age, the ACTU plugged for the move to mega-unions, which the Labor government funded at great expense to the Australian taxpayer. Notwithstanding the fact that it now uses the ILO to support what it is doing, there was no support from the ILO for mega-unions. But this is what the ACTU wanted, and when the ACTU says to the Labor Party, `Jump', the Labor Party says, `How high?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was clearly a resounding failure and the strategy was abandoned. So now we are going to small unions and this bill puts in place a legalistic mechanism which will enable unions to involve themselves and force union membership on the 70 per cent of employees in the private sector who do not want union involvement and who do not want to be union members. It is just another form of roping in. Those people on the other side who know a bit about it&mdash;and they are getting fewer because their ranks are being filled with academics&mdash;know that that is exactly correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this bill will be threefold. First, it will be a disincentive to enterprise based agreements. Secondly, there will not be any non-union enterprise based agreements. The employers are not that stupid. They are not going to put in an enterprise based agreement, have some union official come in who has no relationship with the enterprise, and run the risk of being attacked, whether the next day, week or month, in an attempt to force those people to join the union. Thirdly, and more importantly, it will be a disincentive, particularly for those in the small business sector, to employ people on a full-time basis. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gibson talked about the disincentive to investment. I do not know just how to explain this to Senator Murphy because I have not yet adapted to what I was advised when I first came into this place&mdash;that when talking to people from the other side who have no idea about management or about business decisions and investments, one should talk to them as if they are 12-year-old children. I have tried that and it has not worked, so I will have to lower my sights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition are not and have never been opposed to trade unions. It is the right of individuals to freely and voluntarily join any organisation to pursue their common interests. We are not opposed to that. What we do object to is the compulsion and coercion of individuals to pay fees and become members of an organisation to which they do not wish to belong. I will give an example of this. In May this year on a construction site at Coolum a 62-year-old contractor, Reg Gordge, refused to join the Builders Labourers Federation in Queensland. A newspaper article stated that Mr Gordge</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . just pulled his boots on when he was told that he could not work unless he joined the union.</PARA>
<PARA>It turned out that a BLF official was checking the workers at the 24-unit Pandanus Coolum project to see that they were members. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"They all joined. I was the only one who refused," Mr Gordge said.</PARA>

<PARA>He said that he could see no sense in paying $136 in union membership fees when he was working for only three days on the site. The BLF&mdash;and this is mafia stuff&mdash;works on the basis that once it comes on site and says, `We declare this a construction site', the employer will pay to get it out of the place. On all the examples I have been given of this union, once the employer pays&mdash;because it works on the basis that the employer will pay to get rid of it&mdash;it is not interested in the names; all it is interested in is the money. That is mafia stuff. That is not the sort of thing we want to see in this country, but it is the sort of thing we have and the sort of thing that this bill enhances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practice of compulsion and coercion which existed hundreds of years ago of forcing people to join churches is viewed historically as having been a denial of human rights. That practice, which is frowned upon, is no different from compulsory unionism. Organisations, whether they be churches or trade unions, must earn their members. Membership in both is reported to be falling. No-one would suggest that to alleviate the decline in church membership legislation should be introduced to make it compulsory. This, however, is what this legislation attempts to do in respect of trade union membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a free society, every Australian should and must be free to join, not join or resign from any organisation without fear of intimidation or the retribution of losing his or her job. But this bill fosters that fear. Proposed section 170DF, in fact, is discriminatory, as it proposes that an employer cannot terminate an employee's employment for a number of reasons, including union activity outside working hours or, with permission, inside working hours, or seeking office, or acting or having acted in the capacity of a representative of the employees. This bill, however, does not prohibit employers from dismissing employees for refusing to join a union. There are two sides to this coin. Those who believe in freedom, which we on this side do and which those on the other side obviously do not, must accept that there is another side to that coin. We all know what goes on when this happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember the saga of Phillip Beales, a 28-year-old mechanical fitter at Tom Price who refused to join the Metal and Engineering Workers Union. The union demanded that Hamersley break the WA industrial laws and dismiss Beales, but the company refused. The MEWU closed down Hamersley for two weeks, at great cost to the economy of Australia. At the height of the dispute, 11 iron ore carriers were anchored offshore&mdash;a merchant navy anchored off the West Australian coast. After Hamersley obtained an injunction against the union, the strike ended, Beales came out of hiding&mdash;what a dreadful thing it is to have to say that in this country&mdash;and returned to work. What happened? His house got burnt down. Is that the sort of thing that the government supports?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to know what has happened to the basic democratic principles that have served this country so well. It is the right of every Australian voter to support whatever political party or candidate he wishes. But if his union is affiliated with the Labor Party, he, through the union&mdash;without his permission&mdash;pays a levy to the ALP. That is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the turn of the century Australians were prevented from forming trade unions. That was wrong. If I had been around in those days, I would have joined them in their fight for free association. What I am concerned about is that the freedom achieved has now become compulsory. It is unconscionable that a great number of people cannot get a job without a union ticket. No job, no ticket is alive and well, yet Labor members keep parroting the myth that compulsory unionism does not exist in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill removes sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act and incorporates secondary boycotts under the umbrella of the Industrial Relations Commission. In the process, it has emasculated sections 45D and E, which had acted as a deterrent to unacceptable actions by radical unions. I have given examples in this place before and I will not go over them again, except to say that sections 45D and E were rarely used. In fact, I used them once&mdash;I think I might have been the first to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study will show that when they were used, in not one instance was a moderate, responsible union involved. So the question is: why change it? The reason is that it was part of the pay-off. Part of the religion of the ACTU has been that it did not want section 45D. It has come back to collect and it has got it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our largest export industry is the coal industry with which I have been involved for over 20 years. It made submissions to the standing committee and the minister, pleading that sections 45D and 45E remain as a deterrent. The industry wasted its time as did so many others who, in good faith, made representations, because the deal was done. It was done without consultation with the small business sector; it was done without proper consultation with the people who are supposed to create jobs in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just by way of interest&mdash;because Senator Murphy interjected before and asked, `Tell me why this thing will militate against investment and employment'&mdash;I received a letter from Colleen Wildman, whom I do not know, who works for a company in Toowoomba.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to lodge with you on behalf of Downfields Engineering . . . and quite a few staff members I have shown this to (including myself&mdash;I am an employee, not an employer), our objections to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These unions are instead creating unemployment by forcing private businesses out of business.</PARA>
<PARA>She is not the first one to say things like that. Paul Keating said a similar thing some years ago, before he was Prime Minister, about one of the leaders of the ACTU. Colleen Wildman goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EMPLOYEES NEED EMPLOYERS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Simple stuff&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AND EMPLOYERS NEED EMPLOYEES, so we should all work to-gether for both our Country and ourselves, afterall a lot of Employers don't have to risk their money in businesses creating employment for others&mdash;they could just retire and live happy ever after not caring about the unemployed. This is what could possibly happen if the Labour Government don't stop interfering and trying to make it so hard for the private employer to make a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We at Downfields have a great employer and wish to keep it that way.</PARA>
<PARA>Another concern about this bill will be the effect on the enterprise agreement freely entered into by Metway Bank and its staff association. This has been one of the success stories of enterprise bargaining. It has been of great benefit to the employees and to Metway without interference by outside parties. The only disadvantage suffered was to Metway itself when the Goss Labor government in Queensland decided to exact retribution by taking $18 million which rightfully belonged to Metway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the amendment to clause 12 introduced in the House of Representatives was not accepted by the government. That amendment would have preserved that enterprise agreement. It will be moved at the committee stage in the Senate, as I understand, and I hope the Democrats, particularly the Queenslanders on the Democrat side, will see fit to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is aimed at giving unions the extra muscle to force as many as possible of the 70 per cent of private sector employees to join. It seeks to prop up unions, whether wanted or not, and this will mean that, inevitably, unemployment will increase because people will not invest when they know they are going to be subject to the bully-boy tactics of the more militant unions. Not all unions fit that category. I am the first to admit that; there are good unions. However, a piece of legislation that supports those extreme, radical unions is a recipe for failure. What causes the problem is interference of third parties in the operation of organisations. It lifts costs and jobs go to compensate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great pity of it all is that every piece of legislation which comes into this parliament should be aimed at addressing the totally unacceptable level of unemployment. As Senator Knowles said earlier, the real level of unemployment is now 15 or 16 per cent in Australia&mdash;1.4 million to 1.6 million of our fellow Australians cannot get a job. I would hope that the minister, in his reply to the second reading debate, spells out how the government believes this legislation will address our chronically high and unacceptable level of unemployment which honourable senators will remember was brought about by Mr Keating's recession that we had to have. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill legitimises non-union enterprise bargaining in Commonwealth law for the first time. This is something we have not heard from the critics of this legislation. That is a fact. It actually makes non-union enterprise bargaining legitimate. That fact does not deserve to be ignored because it is a fact of progress and it is something which takes the system away from what it is now to something new.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I stress that is that Senator Parer spent a little time describing some breaches of the present legislation&mdash;not things that were agreed to by the present legislation, not things that were sanctioned by present law, but breaches of law&mdash;as if that was a justification for opposing this bill. I cannot see the relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also grants employers and employees a limited right to industrial action where arbitration is no longer available. It also rebalances secondary boycott provisions to ensure that primary and legitimate secondary boycotts will not be caught and that rapid legal remedies are available to protect industries. It also establishes a new industrial relations court, providing better access for employees and employers seeking legal relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Democrats' view, the broad provisions of this bill are a significant step forward. It is clear that important parts of it have been designed with the Democrats in mind, as a matter of fact, because we have insisted that improvements to the present industrial relations system are necessary, are desirable and should be brought about. We still believe that this legislation needs to be improved in key areas and we will pursue those improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been criticism from employer groups that the bill is a creature of the union movement. The fact that during the formulation process a government and ACTU agreement took place has actually obscured the reality that there are major provisions the union movement would rather do without. The concept of an agreement which was not modified in any way is a concept which is only perpetuated by ignorant reporting of the facts as they occur. The minister has honoured his claim that the bill would cause pain on both sides. Perhaps it is a Chinese saying that negotiation which leaves both parties crying is a good result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers claim that Australia is uncompetitive because wage levels and on-costs are too high; some want a low safety net to allow wages to be driven down. We respond to that sort of criticism by saying that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill allows wage cuts and condition-bargaining to be arrived at through enterprise bargaining, but only if the Australian Industrial Relations Commission believes that that is not contrary to public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Peter Roberts, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 18 November, the New South Wales Office of Economic Development will soon release a report showing that Australian wages are actually lower than those paid in our more advanced Asian neighbours such as Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome Senator Kernot's attendance to the debate. It is through her work and research only recently in Europe that we have revealed that on-costs in many parts of Europe have  much less impact on employment levels than is sometimes claimed. Honourable senators wishing to comment on this sort of area should back up their hollow rhetoric with claims based on the sort of research that Senator Kernot did in Europe which revealed the extent of the falsity of the claim that it is on-costs in Australia that are making our industries uncompetitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retention of awards has been criticised, too, because they are described as being too restrictive. In this legislation the new process of reviewing awards every three years should simplify those awards and turn them into a genuine safety net. The new enterprise flexibility agreements stream will prevent unions from obstructing an enterprise deal which overrides excessively prescriptive award provisions. I would suggest that that is another example of this bill's reduction of union power, in complete contradiction to the claims by some who have chosen to comment on this and communicate with us that this bill somehow extends union power. Nothing could be further from the truth. I repeat an observation I made earlier in my contribution here that this bill, for the first time, legitimises non-union enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some employer groups have claimed that the non-union agreements stream containing enterprise flexibility agreements will not be used because the unions can have too great a role in that process. The Democrats' response to that suggestion is that precedent suggests that the Industrial Relations Commission would grant a right to be heard to a union which is party to an award to be varied by enterprise bargaining agreement even if it were not in this bill. The commission has an extremely limited discretion to refuse approval of an enterprise flexibility agreement. Unless an objecting union can show that the agreement fails the tests in this bill, the union would have very little chance of convincing the commission to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That opinion&mdash;that statement&mdash;which is based on the precedents which have been established through the history of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, is backed up by the situation we observe in Tasmania with the recent court finding in the Delta Hydraulics case. Union participation before the enterprise commissioner of Tasmania had previously been denied, but the court found that this was without foundation and contrary to justice, if you like. The concept that a union which had been party to the making of an award in the past should be denied the opportunity to be heard is not sustainable. Even if we did not have that provision in this bill, as I said earlier, precedent suggests that the Industrial Relations Commission would be loath to consider such an agreement without at least hearing from the union. I emphasise the word `hearing' because that process has been portrayed as the opportunity for unions to have a veto over such an agreement. Again, that is not the case. There is no provision for veto; there is the opportunity for that union to present its case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union notification provisions for enterprise flexibility agreements, in our belief, are not satisfactory as they are, and we will be seeking to amend them to modify that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned that some finance sector employers who are now covered by state awards want to fast-track into the federal system so they can make enterprise flexibility agreements. We agree with that and will be seeking to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will seek to reduce excessively prescriptive requirements which have been described as being a series of hurdles. Evidence given to the Senate committee of inquiry into this bill suggested there were a number of hurdles which employers would find far too difficult to jump. The fact that some of those were consequential and the fact that some of them were provisions which could be met by merely being in existence by employing somebody were conveniently ignored. But I would agree&mdash;and we can find some relevance in the claim&mdash;that some of these procedures are excessively prescriptive. We will pursue that to see if we can find a more convenient way around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those procedures which remain are there to help to ensure fairness and good management in enterprise bargaining; they are not aimed at employers who are attempting to do the right thing with their team of workers. They are there to protect workers against those who would exploit their position to unfairly disadvantage the people they should be working with as a team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection against unfair dismissal has been attacked as giving unions a veto over such sackings. We do not agree with that description of the provision; in fact, we think it is completely untrue. All the bill requires is for unions to be consulted where more than 15 employees are to be made redundant at the same time. Of the several dozen faxes and communications received in the last few days, the vast majority are from employers of six, eight or 10 employees who are unduly concerned about such a provision. They have been misled. These people who have gone about their business making, constructing, producing and contributing to Australia's wealth have been misled by communications directed to them by people who do not have a real interest in this bill and who just want to obstruct the progress of legislation. The people who have been contributing to Australia's wealth have been misled by the suggestion that somehow or other this particular provision will impinge on their freedom to negotiate and to work with their employees. That is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision covers the situation where more than 15 employees are to be made redundant at the one time&mdash;and only in certain circumstances, anyway&mdash;and it makes provision for the unions to be consulted.

The thrust of the termination provisions is to provide for procedural fairness and a proper look at alternatives for dismissal&mdash;in other words, good management and a touch of humanity. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you would be aware that the Australian Medical Association has highlighted the gross insensitivity with which some people are sacked in this country and the serious health problems that unemployment brings. It takes a bizarre imagination to cast employers in the role of victims of these provisions when the aim of the provisions is to help people who are about to lose their livelihoods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secondary boycott provisions have been attacked as rendering employers vulnerable to unreasonable industrial action. In principle, the scheme proposed in the bill better balances the rights of employers with those of employees. The intention is to legitimise sympathy strikes within the same company or group of companies and boycotts on multi-employer sites where one employer is endangering employees of other companies. Other boycotts will remain illegal and subject to the full force of the law. The government has responded to our concerns that the 72-hour conciliation period should be a maximum, which can be short-circuited where real harm is being caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Court has been attacked as being unnecessary and wasteful, but there is a range of new functions specified in this bill for that Industrial Relations Court&mdash;for instance, in the minimum entitlements provisions, which may best be vested in a specialist court. As well, at the insistence of the Democrats, the provisions for judicial registrars will provide cheap and ready access for individuals who have a case which is not efficiently presented in a major legal challenge but which is rather more suited to a small claims tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendments that have been presented since this bill was first introduced in the lower house have lowered that wall between the new court and the Federal Court. Nevertheless, concerns have been raised with us that the new court will be bound by existing court rules, with all their complexity and potential for large legal costs. We would prefer that the new court be required to operate efficiently, cheaply and with a minimum of procedure. We would like the government to consider a future amendment to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to strike and lockout during negotiations for single business certified agreements has been attacked as a recipe for industrial disputation which could send businesses to the wall. That is the sort of statement that has been made. But legitimising strikes and lockouts where arbitration is not available is consistent with international law. Employer groups have previously acknowledged that. Almost all unions and employees have the commonsense not to destroy their own jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor to be considered against the criticism of those rights to strike, to lock out or to engage in limited industrial action is that a bargaining period can be terminated by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission if one side refuses to negotiate. We raised with the government whether termination could occur on other grounds, but the fact is that any such provision would weaken the move towards bargaining and away from arbitration. Arbitration would be seen as a shelter from such a situation. Nevertheless, any return to widespread and damaging disputation would now warrant a more intrusive commission role in enterprise bargaining because the commission now has much more authority through the provisions in this bill than previously. But it is up to unions and employers to avoid an outcome that neither wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain concerned that groups with low bargaining power will miss out under enterprise bargaining. For example, work forces where women are in the majority are less likely to achieve pay rises through enterprise bargaining. But Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that no overall fall in women's pay relative to men has occurred through that process. The award review process and the minimum entitlements provisions will provide some protection for those groups, who could also include young people, old people, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, and so on. Parliament needs to monitor the impact of enterprise bargaining on such vulnerable groups and to be able to take corrective action if undesirable trends emerge. The Democrats will be moving for an annual survey to be conducted and for the results to be tabled in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have another concern in that, although the bill requires the commission to take into account the ILO family responsibilities convention, we do not believe that the assumptions associated with that convention go far enough. With so many working couples in the workplace, it is high time that carers' leave was made available to allow workers to care for sick dependants, whether they are children, aged relatives or spouses with serious illnesses. We will be moving amendments requiring the commission to investigate and make orders on that matter. We will also move that leave to care for a sick spouse be extended to people not in traditional family units. That will require further definition in the committee stage. We have other concerns which we will be pursuing in the committee stage. Nevertheless, we support the general thrust of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. In doing so, I want to focus on the effect on the working women of Australia. While the bill will have a significant effect on all sectors of the work force, I am conscious that very little of the public debate has centred on what it will mean for working women. This comment extends not only to the debate in the House of Representatives and the Senate but also to the media coverage during the months leading up to the introduction of the legislation into the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For months we had a running saga in our newspapers about the progress of the government's negotiations on industrial reform. We have seen the Minister for Industrial Relations, Laurie Brereton, promising to bring about genuine reform in the labour market. He was going to do what none of his predecessors could achieve, namely, facilitate workplace bargaining and enterprise deals for non-unionists into the industrial relations structure. In a speech given by the minister in mid-October to mark the occasion of enterprise bargaining week, he said that the government's industrial reform package `would entrench enterprise bargaining as the very hallmark of Australia's industrial relations system'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all saw the minister being rolled by the ACTU. Any prospect of real reform disintegrated as a result of that. What we have not seen is extensive coverage on the impact of this proposed legislation on women. A week after the bill was finally tabled in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Industrial Relations made a very telling remark, namely, that the government would be making amendments to the bill to protect women from discrimination in the workplace. He was speaking at a conference in Sydney, a forum on the glass ceiling. He said that night&mdash;I think it was something like 4 November&mdash;that he would be introducing a range of amendments to the proposed legislation during the next sitting of parliament designed to ensure fairness and equity for women in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seemed very odd to me. We actually issued a press release on it. Here was the minister who had done all this so-called consulting and suddenly light had dawned on him that really he had not addressed the issue of women. It was somewhat ironic because, a week before tabling the bill, he issued a joint press release with Senator Crowley assuring women's groups that the government's industrial relations package would be fair and equitable to women. Yet he had to come in after the bill had been tabled and say that with the amendments he would address some of the concerns that women's groups had raised with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within a week of the final draft, and after months of protracted negotiations with the ACTU, he admitted that the bill had been drafted without the necessary consultation to take the needs of women fully into account. One has to laugh when the Labor government touts itself as the great protector of women. What it should be saying is that women are a mere afterthought in Labor's scheme of things. So while the government and much of the media have been prepared largely to ignore the effect of this proposed legislation on women, I am certainly not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another compelling reason why the position of women in relation to this bill warrants special consideration and comment. Women experience quite different employment status and occupational segregation and remuneration from men. Currently, around 3.2 million Australian workers, or 42 per cent of the total Australian labor force, are women. Of these 3.2 million women, around 75 per cent are employed on a part-time basis. In comparison, only 25 per cent of the 4.4 million Australian men in the labour force are part-time workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Apart from the predominance of women in part-time employment, women's employment is concentrated in particular occupations and industries. Well over half of Australia's working women are employed in the community services and wholesale and retail trade sectors. Women also dominate in finance and business services as well as in recreation, personal and other service sectors. Historically, these sectors have been less than industrially powerful than some of the male dominated sectors such as the mining, manufacturing and construction industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that women generally fall into the lower status occupations that tend to be less industrially powerful and receive wages below the national average. So in general women tend to occupy lower status and lower paid jobs in relatively industrially weak sectors of the labour force. Unfortunately, little is going to change under the proposals contained in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central feature of this bill supposedly is to deliver institutional change to enable genuine enterprise bargaining. It is meant to represent a move away from our inflexible, outmoded, centralised wage fixing system. Rather than achieving this end, the bill reinforces and extends the federal industrial relations jurisdiction and the unions' role within it without extending access to workplace agreements to non-unionised workplaces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply a disaster for working women in this country. Traditionally, women have not been well looked after or represented by the trade union movement. Not surprisingly, fewer women have been and are currently members of trade unions than men. It is notable that union membership has been and still is lower amongst part-time workers, most of whom are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are also under-represented in the trade union structure. There are currently only eight women on the 38 strong ACTU executive. Recent surveys also confirm that Australia's biggest unions are themselves performing poorly as employers in putting women into influential positions. Only last week a conference on affirmative action for women in trade unions was told that an</PARA>
<PARA>analysis of eight key unions showed that jobs held by women were likely to have less power and status and be distant from decision making. The author of the survey said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The higher we look in the union hierarchy, the less likely we are to find women employed.</PARA>
<PARA>By entrenching the role of unions in the new industrial relations environment, there is a very real concern that women will be disadvantaged. If unions effectively have a monopoly on the negotiations preceding enterprise agreements the best interests of women are likely not to be served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women need uninhibited access to enterprise bargaining if they are going to enjoy the benefits that it can deliver. I believe that there are tremendous gains for women in true enterprise bargaining but, in order to achieve these gains, women need to be at the negotiating table when the deal is being struck. They need to be informed about the process and able to engage freely in the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a comment on the role that the Australian Federation of Business and Professional Women has played in doing just that. It has produced a booklet called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Snakes and Ladders</EMPHASIS> which very clearly outlines to women the role that they can play in enterprise bargaining; that is, what they can do, how they can negotiate wages and how they can negotiate terms and conditions. It goes through these roles in a very clear, precise way. This is a positive step that the federation has taken to inform women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would recommend that any woman who is concerned about the issue of enterprise bargaining should read that booklet. It is a positive action that is being taken. It is the sort of thing that should be being done to encourage women to take responsibility, to be part of that negotiating process and to be there. It is often the case that men have the positions in unions. They are the ones dominating the decision making with the outcomes of those arrangements suiting men and not the needs of women who want to pick up children from school and who want to be involved in situations such as caring for older relatives or whatever else they might want to negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the multiple roles that Australian women play&mdash;as carers, as workers, as mothers and as individuals&mdash;they need the upmost flexibility in their working arrangements. Genuine enterprise bargaining can deliver this flexibility in that it can allow women to negotiate more flexible working hours; it can reduce the stress involved in juggling a family and a job; and it can allow women to maintain a career with less interruption. But this will not happen while an out of touch, male dominated union sector and a male dominated hierarchy clings tenaciously to its pivotal negotiating role. </PARA>

In Asia an immense amount of store is placed on good faith and personal relationships and, most importantly, an immense amount of store is placed on etiquette.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one of the few Asian Australians involved in politics, let me say that one cannot stress too much the importance of etiquette. If one reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Analects</EMPHASIS>, one will see that half of what Confucius wrote&mdash;and I know Confucius is not directly relevant to Malaysia&mdash;was about etiquette; that is, what was good etiquette and bad etiquette, how one should learn etiquette and how one should apply etiquette.

He has tried to excuse it on the basis that Dr Mahathir had not personally complained.

I spoke recently to perhaps one of the most influential Malaysian born Australian businessmen.

Mr Keating does not even have to do it himself and that will be sufficient. But every day we dither, we make the situation worse.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ) conclusion was based on advice from the Northern Territory that the presence of the giant termite species Mastotermes darwiniensis in northern Australia required the use of organochlorine insecticides. The Northern Territory Minister for Primary Industry and Fisheries in a submission to the National Registration Authority's Inquiry into Organochlorines reiterated the unsuitability of alternative chemical and non-chemical treatments in the Northern Territory for the protection of buildings under construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of an organochlorine insecticide for retreatment of existing buildings was also considered a necessity in areas where Mastotermes are present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am aware that a number of holders of Australian passports, who have been identified by the Greek Authorities as having actively espoused views on the "Macedonia" issue contrary to Greek views, have been refused entry to Greece on the basis of their alleged anti-Greek views. Some of those refused entry were child refugees from the Greek civil war (1946-49).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A number of Australian passport holders were refused entry into Greece in 1988. I am aware of community claims that those refused entry numbered in excess of 50, although this figure cannot be verified. The incident referred to followed a reunion held in Skopje to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of refugees leaving Greece, the holding of which had generated considerable tension in Greece.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am aware that in the 1986 census, some 4,000 people claiming to be of Macedonian ethnicity indicated that they had been born in Greece. Some of these came to Australia as child refugees, although there are no specific statistics on the number of child refugees. The figure of 550 is a community estimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian Embassy in Athens has in the past queried the decision by Greek authorities to refuse entry to  certain Australian passport holders, but the Australian Government recognises that ultimately the Greek Government has the right to apply such conditions of entry and entry procedures as it sees fit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Greek community in Australia benefits under the Australian Government's policy of multiculturalism, as does the broader community. Ethnic communities in Australia, whether they be Greek or any other nationality, will continue to benefit from this policy irrespective of the internal political or human rights situations in their countries of origin. The Australian Government supports the observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights, and has made representations to the Greek Government when there is evidence to suggest that allegations of abuse of human rights may have some basis in fact.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Sri Lankan conflict, for most of 1993, has been characterised by occasional skirmishes, most of which have occurred in the east of the island or on the lagoons surrounding Jaffna. The Sri Lankan Government has been pursuing a strategy of driving the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) out of the east in preparation for the holding of local council elections. However, on 26 July 1993 the LTTE overran the Sri Lankan Army base at Janakpura, killing approximately 60 service personnel and 17 civilians and capturing a large quantity of weapons. Subsequently, in late September the Sri Lankan Government forces launched a five day operation, codenamed "Yal Devi", to the northwest of the Government base at Elephant Pass, resulting in the reported deaths of 130 LTTE and 118 Government troops. The LTTE responded by launching a large-scale attack on Government army and naval bases near Pooneryn to the west of Elephant Pass on 11 November. At the time of writing, Government losses were estimated at over 300 with a further 450 unaccounted for, while LTTE losses have been put at about 450.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Details of civilian casualties from the latest battle are not yet known but very few, if any, civilians were believed to be in the  vicinity of the bases when the attack took place. The Sri Lankan Air Force subsequently undertook a series of bombing raids on LTTE targets in the Jaffna area. Inaccurate bombing during these raids is reported to have resulted in an as yet unconfirmed number of civilian deaths and injuries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excluding the battle at Pooneryn, total civilian casualties in the north during 1993 are estimated at approximately 250, comprising 120 killed during Government shelling and bombing, and 130 killed or missing while attempting to cross the Jaffna lagoon. No information is available on casualties which might have been occasioned by LTTE operations in the area, although LTTE attacks on Sinhalese and Muslim villagers have lessened following adverse local and international reaction to their terror campaign in 1992 during which hundreds of civilians were killed. Further civilian casualties can be expected from continued LTTE activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Apart from providing support during major military operations, Government forces resort infrequently to the use of artillery or aerial bombardments. Attempts are made to hit designated targets from the air, but it is apparent that some Government forces lack the expertise and equipment to achieve their objective precisely.  It is the usual practice of the Sri Lankan forces to undertake an aerial leaflet drop prior to the launching of a major operation. The leaflets advise civilians to take cover in designated places. However, the latest inaccurate sorties by the Sri Lankan Air Force in the Jaffna area indicate that designated civilian sanctuaries do not necessarily provide guaranteed safety to civilians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Australian High Commission in Colombo has made frequent representations to the Government of Sri Lanka, urging it to exercise restraint in its activities against the LTTE and to resume negotiations on a settlement of the communal problems in Sri Lanka. This activity includes representations to senior officers of the Armed Forces, senior Ministers, Parliamentarians and senior bureaucrats. The High Commission also participates in periodic group consultations with key military and civilian decision-makers. Direct contact with the LTTE is more difficult because it is in armed conflict with the Government and because of the geographic isolation of the LTTE leadership. The LTTE would be aware though of the Australian Government's statements deploring the continued violence in Sri Lanka and calling for both the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE to strive for a negotiated settlement to the conflict. The Australian Government also maintains an open and constructive dialogue with a number of groups in Australia of Sri Lankan origin, including a number of Tamil organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) I raised the prospect of Australia seeking to facilitate a role for the Commonwealth in promoting a negotiated settlement to the conflict with senior Sri Lankan Government officials during my visit to Sri Lanka in August 1990. Subsequent to my visit then Prime Minister Hawke wrote to the Sri Lankan President, the late Ranasinghe Premadasa, reiterating Australia's willingness to assist. While welcoming Australia's offer, the Sri Lankan President indicated a preference to continue attempts at direct negotiations between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. A number of subsequent similar offers of assistance have been received by the Sri Lankan Government from international groups, church-based organisations and individuals. The Sri Lankan Government's response has continued to be that the  conflict is a matter for internal resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sri Lankan Government has stated publicly that it is willing to engage the LTTE in negotiations and has on a number of occasions invited the LTTE to participate in a Joint Parliamentary Committee which has been examining ways and means of resolving the conflict. However, little or no progress towards peace has been achieved since the series of meetings between the Government and the LTTE, which were held in Colombo in 1990, were abandoned by the LTTE. Since then LTTE actions, such as reneging on agreements to exchange its prisoners for supplies, have not assisted calls for dialogue to resolve the conflict. Despite the assassination of President Premadasa in Colombo on 1 May 1993, which the Sri Lankan Government attributes most firmly to the LTTE, President Wijetunga renewed the Government's offer to negotiate with the LTTE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government hopes that the recent fierce battle in the Pooneryn area, and the attendant tragic loss of so many lives, will not result in further attacks seeking retribution but will serve to focus both sides' attention on the essentiality of striving for a negotiated settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against the background of the Sri Lankan Government's view that the conflict is an internal matter, there seems little that the United Nations, the Commonwealth or the Australian Government can contribute, apart from continuing to urge both sides to resume negotiations and to avoid further tragic loss of life, particularly among the civilian population. But the Government stands ready to help facilitate any steps towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The first human insulins were approved for marketing in Australia in 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Porcine insulins were withdrawn from the market in December 1989 following a commercial decision by the pharmaceutical companies which sponsored them. Bovine insulins remain on the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) indicate that the proportion of insulin prescriptions that were specifically for human insulin rose above fifty per cent for the first time in the 1989/90 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In the 1992/93 financial year, 90.6 per cent of insulin prescriptions under the PBS were for human insulins and 9.4 per cent were for bovine insulins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information from a company which supplies porcine insulins suggests that a small number of diabetics (less than 150) continue to use these products under the Special Access Scheme (SAS) for unregistered drugs. As porcine insulins are not registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods they are not subsidised under the PBS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Decisions regarding transfer from animal to human insulins would have been made by prescribing physicians and their patients. The particular reasons for a transfer would vary from patient to patient. Factors influencing such decisions may have included:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the non-availability of porcine insulins after December 1989;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the increasing popularity of insulin pen injectors which are only available with human insulin;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">perceptions by prescribers that human insulins held some advantage over animal insulins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The department has not been involved in the decision-making processes of the physicians who prescribe human insulins, or those of the pharmaceutical companies which decided to remove porcine insulins from the market. It is therefore not possible to provide details of the rationale for their decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. Some studies have reported an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemic unawareness in patients transferring from animal to human insulins. Other studies have shown no difference between the two types of insulin. Recent research published in the New England Journal of Medicine (16 September 1993) suggests that these apparent effects are not related to the type of insulin but to the degree of control of diabetes itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has permitted sponsor companies to supply porcine insulins under the Special Access Scheme (SAS) for unapproved drugs to those patients who have had difficulties with human insulin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) No. The TGA understands that in the United Kingdom porcine insulins were never removed from the market. While some patients may have returned to using them, human insulins are still widely used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Hypoglycaemic unawareness occurs with both human and animal-based insulins. As indicated above, recent research suggests that this adverse reaction may be related to the degree of diabetic control rather than a change of insulin type. At this stage there is insufficient evidence to confirm that the incidence of this adverse event is higher with one or the other insulin type.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) In the past twelve months there have been no applications lodged by pharmaceutical companies with the TGA to alter the formulations of marketed bovine insulins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TGA does not regulate the formulation of unregistered products supplied under the SAS. However, the supplier of porcine insulins under the SAS has informed the TGA that there have been no recent changes to the formulation of these products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) Persons with diabetes are at risk of developing a number of serious complications. These include hypoglycaemia, hypoglycaemic unawareness, blindness, vascular disease and neurological conditions. It is not possible to speculate as to which of these represents the greatest concern to an individual patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) In 1994, the National Health and Medical Research Council provided grants totalling $2 million for 25 research projects specifically in the field of diabetes. Details of these grants are attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Insulin products supplied in Australia are manufactured in the USA, UK or Denmark and imported by local sponsors. These products must comply with the standards specified in the monographs of the British Pharmacopoeia (BP) and the criteria set out in the European Guidelines for the products of recombinant technology. Copies of the BP are generally held by the Pharmacy departments of major hospitals and the larger public libraries. Copies of the European Guideline documents may be obtained through Hunter Publications, PO Box 404, Abbotsford VIC, 3067.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13 &amp; 14) Insulin products are included in the quality surveillance program conducted by the TGA Laboratories and 30 samples have been analysed during the past 2 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)-(5) Training and Development activity within the Department of Defence, which is covered by the Training and Guarantee Act 1990, is largely being devolved to eight programs, ie, Forces Executive, Navy, Army, Air Force, Strategy and Intelligence, Acquisition and Logistics, Budget and Management, and Science and Technology. Only where it is important to achieve a high level of consistency of outcomes, policy integrity and/or equity are these activities managed centrally. As I noted in my response to a similar question from Senator Short on 28 May 1992, to produce the information required to respond to the honourable senator's question would require very significant resources.</PARA>
