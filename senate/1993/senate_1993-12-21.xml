<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a comment and question on clause 47. During the course of the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a submission was received from the New South Wales government in relation to clause 47. Concern was expressed by the government that the meaning of `acts that are essentially the same' was uncertain. The New South Wales government said that it is not clear what is meant by `acts which are essentially the same'. It may mean acts of essentially the same class or of the same nature, both in effect and time. For example, renewal of a mining lease will be an act of essentially the same class as the original lease. Does clause 47 mean that compensation is paid only for the original lease? Alternatively, the renewal is not essentially the same because it affects native title at a different time to the original lease, even though its terms may be the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government was saying that it could see the purpose of this clause to avoid double-dipping with compensation but, of course, `acts which are essentially the same' does not really cover it. I wondered what the government had in mind in relation to that phrase, bearing in mind the comments from the New South Wales government?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have already debated this clause, including that particular question. If the honourable senator can hold on for a moment, I will remind myself what the answer is. Acts that are essentially the same, for example, in the context of a statutory grant of a mining lease under some special provision of the kind that exists in Western Australia would be, I guess, the passage of the legislation creating the framework for the grant of the interest in question, then the actual grant of the interest and perhaps some further action taken pursuant to the practical on the ground implementation of the development pursuant to that grant of interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would be an example of acts that are essentially the same. An example of acts that would not be essentially the same would, I suppose, be an exploration permit granting act on the one hand as compared with a mining grant act on the other. In other words, these are two kinds of acts of inherently quite different impact on the Aboriginal land in question and thus giving rise to different sorts of considerations about their compatibility with the enjoyment of the native title in question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to clause 49, subclause (2), and I note there that it talks of acquisition under compulsory acquisition act. It appears to me that that definition, compulsory acquisition act, might not be covered in state legislation dealing with public works and that it may well mean that the states have to amend their legislation accordingly to fit in with this definition. I just wondered whether there had been any liaison with the states in relation to this aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to clause 49 generally, and I suppose the compensation provisions here, and I am looking at the heading `Criteria for determining compensation' on page 27 of the bill, a question which has been put to me on several occasions is: how does one actually place a monetary value on native title which does not really know, or hitherto has not known, any place in our legal system, in our land system? What sorts of aspects does one look to to put a dollar value on it? I could understand how one might provide land in satisfaction of a claim, and it would be somewhat difficult to assess how even the assessment of services equates with the loss of the land. What research has been done in relation to this, and can the minister give us any idea as to guidelines that would be used? Is it simply going to be a dollar per acre, or what?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is obviously a matter that has to be left to the tribunals and the courts to determine. There is no further guidance in the legislation other than the provision in 49(1) to which Senator Ellison refers. It will be a matter of case by case determination and presumably the evolution of a body of relevant principles governing this as a result of that common law type, case by case determination. The courts and tribunals are entirely familiar, generally, with dealing with calculations of quantum of loss, diminution, impairment and so on. These are not unusual concepts, although they are being here applied in a new context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite impossible to give any further answer than that, because it will depend on so many variables: the calculation of the precise extent of the native title in question&mdash;whether it is a hunting and gathering kind of title or whether it is more in the nature of freehold. It will depend on a whole variety of considerations that will be before the tribunal. While everyone acknowledges that that is an uncertain process, given that we are talking here essentially about compensation payable by governments rather than by private commercial interests, it is manageable that it should be thus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister himself has just expressed some guidelines by saying that it depends on the nature of the title, whether it is hunting and gathering and so on. But why not set down some guidelines for the assessment of this, because at the moment it seems that what we are going to start with is a completely blank sheet? There is going to be no guideline for this tribunal to kick off with, so to speak, and that to me just has the potential for challenges and appeals. Why does the government not start off by giving them at least some of the most basic criteria to go by?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what the minister said was good but I cannot find in the bill where it says how the question of compensation is looked at&mdash;whether it is a hunting and gathering situation or whether it is a freehold situation. There is a whole range of situations from hunting and gathering right through to the Murray Islanders who were cultivators and had their own sort of land system. Why not put that in the bill as a starting point and at least give the tribunal something to work with from day one when it starts sitting to hear these claims rather than just make it up as it goes along, although I am not suggesting that that will be the case in a derogatory sense?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it would be particularly possible to do better than the courts are capable of doing themselves in this situation. There is no particular magic about what I said about depending on the different kind of native title. That is implicit from the way that 49(1) is drafted, when it talks in terms of compensation for any loss et cetera or other effect of the act on their native title rights and interests. What the native title rights and interests are, the character of them, the extent of them and the scale of them have to be identified in order to begin to calculate what loss or diminution or impairment might be involved. I think it is a pretty self-evident kind of process in terms of the issues that have got to be taken into account. But how those different factors are actually quantified really is best left, we believe, to the tribunals and the courts to work out. I do not think we can do a better job than they could do. And for that reason it is left up to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a brief comment to place on the record. I feel that the role of the legislature is to make the law and in that law set down quite clearly how the law is to be implemented. It is also to provide guidelines for the courts which then interpret the law. Oliver Wendell Holmes was asked on his way to court whether he was on his way to do justice, to which he replied that he was not; he was just going to administer the law. There is a big difference, of course, but the role of the courts is really to administer the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a problem here in that there is insufficient detail to set up this totally innovative scheme because what will happen is that not only might the one side be aggrieved by the decisions but another side as well. The native titleholders could be saying that they think there is inconsistency in the tribunals' approach because they gave a ruling for one clan but they did not do it for another. There is a lack of consistency, therefore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever there is a lack of consistency in the law, we have litigation and we have appeals. Primarily what this bill is trying to sort out is a legislative response to the Mabo decision. I place on record that I think this is a real problem. There should have been consultation with Aboriginal groups and people with expertise in the area, to the extent that some guidelines for compensation at least should have been set down so that, on day one, not only the tribunal but any future litigants would know what they were dealing with when talking about compensation. We must remember that there are two separate phases. One is the determination of native title and the other is the determination of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I have a personal injuries case, I know what the standards are when I go to court and ask for compensation for a client because there are certain things I look at. It is very easy in our legal system and with our background to have a set formula for economic loss, pain and suffering, payment for bills and disbursements that have occasioned by virtue of the whole mishap of an accident. But in this area it is completely left open, and I really believe that that is a breeding ground for uncertainty and future litigation. So I place on record that I think this legislation is insufficient. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of technical and legal questions have been asked in this committee of the whole debate. It did not surprise me to hear the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) say that there had been discussions with the states, but it did surprise me to hear him say that one of the criteria that may be lacking in the laws of certain states is the criterion on just terms. That came as a little bit of a surprise to me, to be quite frank. I had not realised that. I had assumed that that would be an absolutely essential criterion for compensation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had a referendum about that, as Senator Harradine may recall, which was voted down as a result of a campaign by various unmentionable people. The fact of the matter is that there is no absolute guarantee of just terms being payable under state law, and there are a number of different state statutory acquisition contexts where just terms are not payable but some other formula is identified. It is important to make absolutely sure that these criteria are satisfied. It may, in a number of cases, involve no legislative amendment at all but just a checking exercise, but it is not to be assumed that state law is in accordance with these principles.</PARA></TALK.START>

Maybe, on reflection, that is what should have happened. It should have been given a longer time. The government is intent on getting this bill through the parliament this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it could be done. There is a provision&mdash;I am trying to help&mdash;for a joint committee in the legislation. That joint committee is to look at the implementation and operation of the legislation. My proposal is that another paragraph be added to its functions, that it report to both houses not later than a particular day in February, probably late February, on the implications of the implementation and operation of the act, and whether in the light of such implications any amendments should be made to the act to better reflect the spirit and intention of the common law of Australia in respect of native title and to protect the rights and interests of all persons affected by it. That, of course, is based on the preamble of the legislation and does not diverge at all from the spirit of the legislation, but it would post facto, that is, after the bill has been agreed to by both houses, give this joint committee the opportunity of then calling people to give evidence, of questioning witnesses and of putting a number of these very technical questions to the people who might appear before that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, if it were agreed, it would in fact expedite debate in this committee of the whole stage. I am just indicating that that is what is being floated, and the key to it would be that the sections of the bill, other than sections 1 and 2 and the section relating to the establishment of the committee, would not operate until such time as the committee reported and any amendments recommended were debated by the parliament. I do not want a debate on it here because I understand the leaders are looking at the question, and I canvass the matter with the Greens and the Democrats. When the detailed amendment is available, everybody will be able to have a look at it. </PARA>

The answer to Senator Parer's question is in the positive. The Commonwealth would be looking, in negotiation with the state of Queensland, to ensure that the procedures of the mining wardens court would be consistent with the criteria that the Commonwealth is insisting on. It also re-emphasises the fact that, as a matter of policy in relation to land management, the Commonwealth's central position is that it wants the states to continue to administer that.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I said before, the entire policy thrust of this legislation is to provide for the unquestionable constitutional position of the Commonwealth in making laws in respect of Aboriginal people and to also, at the same time, sensibly preserve the matter of land management with the states&mdash;where it rightly should be. It is a question of finding arrangements in discussions with the states.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans said that in respect of compensation&mdash;I think it was in response to Senator Ellison&mdash;this matter should be left to the tribunals and the courts, and that it would be a case by case evaluation which would evolve. With regard to the mining wardens court, there are already established concepts. Those established concepts are such that, where a dispute occurs or where an agreement cannot be reached between the parties&mdash;be they graziers or anyone else&mdash;the mining warden determines the extent of compensation, based on some financial loss.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is usually done by determining the sale price of properties within the vicinity. It relates, for example, to where a portion is taken from a landowner's property where there is a reduction in the carrying capacity of that property. There are cases of disturbance, for example, where dust gets on the grass and the cattle or sheep cannot eat it for a period of 12 months. So it is a clearly established concept in the mining wardens courts. The problem that I have is how those established concepts can be applied to native title. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Gareth Evans correctly said, the fundamental establishment of what will become, without doubt, the benchmarks for these kinds of assessments should be sensibly made by the tribunals and the courts that are going to administer this matter. In a general sense, the same kinds of concepts and grounds for assessment that are made and have always been made in mining wardens courts will also apply to native titleholders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the reason for the requirement that the Commonwealth has to ensure that those administrative procedures are consistent with the Commonwealth's position is that that whole concept of native title recognised by common law is a new concept established by the High Court of Australia. In a general sense, the tribunals will make those assessments, consistent with the same criteria that they use for titleholders other than native titleholders, with the additional gloss of having to adjust to and to establish new grounds for this additional question of native title rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The consistent line that has been pushed&mdash;and, I regret to say, by people relying on the interjections of Senator Bishop&mdash;is that somehow this is a strange or unique situation. The criteria used by mining wardens courts are that there are sums payable for disturbance and so on, but then there are additional sums paid for the particular circumstances of the titleholder involved. This is simply a recognition that the particular circumstances of native titleholders may well be different from those of a pastoralist or someone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simplest example to use in terms of different compensation payments being used for different situations is that the compensation payable for a broken back would be significantly different from the compensation payable for a broken thumb.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give what would be the most common situation. It certainly has occurred in my experience in the Northern Territory on a number of occasions, and has been resolved by agreement. If, for example, the native title rights have been extinguished, it may well be that an agreement can be reached. This is not forced on anyone, but the opportunity is provided by this measure for compensation to be paid in kind. The most obvious compensation that would be paid in kind would be other appropriate land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commonest example that springs to mind where this was done was in respect of the stock routes question in the Northern Territory. Under the land rights act, the stock routes were made available for claim but were not necessarily the most suitable areas of land for Aboriginal people to use. By a long process of negotiation, what was commonly done in those cases was Aboriginal people agreed to forgo their claims to the stock routes in exchange for a piece of land which was more suitable for both them and the pastoral owner. That is the kind of situation which will be provided for under these provisions. </PARA>

If it is by agreement, can the minister tell me why it is built into the legislation that the court or person or body must consider the request and may, instead of determining the whole or part of the compensation, recommend that the person liable to give the compensation should, within a specified period, transfer the property.

But I would point out again: it is not enforceable; it is simply an option which the claimants can ask for. The tribunal is obliged by the legislation to consider that request under clause 6 and, having considered it, it may recommend that that kind of non-monetary compensation should be paid, but that is only a recommendation.

I would envisage that there would be many situations in reality on the ground where that will occur. This simply provides the additional flexibility to get a resolution of the issue not just in favour of the Aboriginal claimant but an arrangement which, in a great many cases, will suit other parties that are involved in this.

I have to say that it is an extraordinary argument to put for someone who does not assert that her concern is that this is something in favour of Aboriginal people. Mr Justice Brennan said very correctly, in a judgment he made some years ago when this was a very popular analogy to draw, that the difference between land rights for Aboriginal people and apartheid is the difference between a home and a prison.

If courts are ruling in a way with which the Parliament does not agree the acts can be changed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a brief comment on the issue Senator Collins raised. It is a quite fundamental issue and should not be skated over in the way it was. The question is whether this particular bill gives rights to one group of people that other Australians do not have. It is a very important issue because Australians like to see all people treated equally before the law of the land, with one law applying to all people. If we impinge on that basic Australian value, we do so at our peril. Indeed, the ability of this bill to receive widespread community acceptance depends on the ability of the government to convince the Australian people that they are not setting up special rights and privileges for a particular race.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument Senator Collins touched on was that, essentially, Mabo was based on the right of inheritance. That is an argument which has certainly been put; it is an argument I have heard, but the fact is that that particular right of inheritance can apply only to a particular racial group. That is an intellectual argument which I am not convinced by, but I understand the point the honourable senator is making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other aspects which, I think, are clearly racial and clearly give special rights to a particular group, and that is where the bill enters into very dangerous territory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue for the community in the acceptance of this bill is the land compensation fund that is being established, which can apply to and assist only people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island background.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is that, as Senator Collins knows, the bill depends for its constitutional head of power on the race power in the bill, and I refer to clause 51(26). I understand why the honourable senator is sensitive about this and why the government is also sensitive, but I think there is, as Senator Bishop said, a growing feeling in the community that we are moving towards separate development. Senator Collins says that this clause can be justified on the basis that we are giving an advantage to a particular group and that therefore the South African experience cannot in any way be applied. It may be the case that an advantage is being given, but that is precisely the reason that this bill will risk not gaining widespread community acceptance. I put it to the honourable senator that the issue Senator Bishop raised cannot be simply brushed over in the way he attempted to do. </PARA>

I think it would be an horrendous result for Australia to have that situation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are seeking to move through clause by clause and to make progress. We want to pick up the technical and practical aspects of this bill. In the last half hour we have witnessed an absolute waste of the committee's time. Provocative statements have come from the minister, and they have provoked me. I genuinely apologise to the chamber for getting angry, but the minister has reflected on the motives of the Western Australian government. He said that the Western Australian government's legislation wipes out all the rights of Aboriginal people. That is gross misrepresentation of the fact. In fact what the Western Australian government has tried to do is to respond to the High Court's Mabo decision in a way which maintains certainty and which maintains that all Western Australians, regardless of race, have equal rights before the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian government goes even further than that. It does what the federal government says it seeks to do, and that is to ensure that where there is disadvantage it is approached in a manner that looks after those people suffering the disadvantage and seeks to overcome that disadvantage. There is no doubt that there is a requirement in a just society for some special measures. There is absolutely no doubt that in this bill there is a whole range of special measures, but certain of these special measures we believe may be contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to proceed in a sensible manner with the consideration of this bill, we should stick to the points. When Senator Bishop said that there are a number of ways of approaching this problem, I am sure she meant&mdash;I will not try to read her mind, although better people than me have tried to do so&mdash;that when we raise the question in the federal parliament about the approaches to Mabo 2, there are certainly a range of approaches the federal parliament and our federal government can take in relation to the High Court's second Mabo decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Ellison said in his point of order, it does not help the debate, particularly when Senator Collins knows that it will inflame the Western Australians, to keep talking about the Western Australian traditional usage legislation. If Senator Collins wants to keep saying, `Our legislation is right and just and caring of Aborigines, and Richard Court's legislation is a nasty, horrible piece of legislation', we will spend the whole day having a fight over that. It will not get the committee very far. I suggest that if honourable senators want to have that debate, we will be here for a long time. None of us wants to be here forever. What we want is to go through this bill, and we have been trying very hard to do that. </PARA>

I appeal to Senator Collins, if he is going to raise it, at least to be honest and tell the truth about it. The minister totally misled this parliament in what he said. The Western Australian legislation does not wipe out all indigenous people's rights. In fact, it gives rights that this legislation does not give and the High Court decision did not give.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"(7) In a paragraph (1)(e) case, the trustee must pay the negotiated compensation in accordance with the decision of the Federal Court mentioned in that paragraph.".</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 50 deals with how compensation paid into trust under the right to negotiate procedures is to be dealt with in circumstances set out in subclause (1). The proposed amendment, which would insert a new paragraph (e) into subclause (1), provides for how the money paid into the trust is to be dealt with if none of the other conditions is satisfied and is thus a catch-all provision. It would permit the Federal Court, on application by any person, to pay the negotiated compensation to that person or another person where it considers it to be just and equitable in the circumstances. This is not a matter of any major policy change, Mr Chairman; it is simply a tidying-up provision for the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are withdrawing their amendments to the body corporate clauses in the bill. We have made a careful examination of the government amendments, which are circulated as No. 75, and actually extend beyond 50 and 53 into a number of other clauses, including 55, 59, 87, 153, 185, 207, 209, 223 and 238. If Senator Ellison agrees, I believe that is a package, and it would be appropriate to deal with them as such. The Australian Democrats were concerned that the provisions in the original bill, in the amendments of the government, seemed to impose a particular structure on native title holders. The point had been raised as to whether this could be construed as being contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore welcome this structure the government has put forward in its amendment package No. 75. It does provide flexibility to native title holders, but it also, through the tribunal, enables consideration of the advantages of a trust or corporate structure which are appropriate for the particular situation native titleholders find themselves in. I believe that the structure as it is before us now offers flexibility. It recommends and enables the establishment of an administrative structure which will ensure that decisions in the native titleholder's community can be made efficiently and responsibly and the money can, if necessary, be held on trust, to ensure that the native titleholders are not disadvantaged. The Australian Democrats support the government's package 75 of amendments. </PARA>

I would like to draw the minister's attention in particular to government amendment No. 25 and the impact this will have on new subclause 53(7), which seeks to protect native title from debt recovery processes. If the body corporate which holds the title becomes liable to pay an amount to a government or any other person, the native title cannot be the subject of a forced sale to recover the amount of the liability. This amendment would make meaningless the sensible provision of all state and territory laws of general application that could apply to native title land, if they could apply to freehold land. For example, on native title land in a rural area, the laws of the state require that land-holders, firstly, contribute to the costs of boundary fences.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I did specifically hear you call reference to clauses 50 to 53. Amendment 25 is a very important matter. I will go back to giving these examples on native title in a rural area, where the laws of the state require landowners to contribute to the cost of boundary fences, to keep land free of feral animals and noxious weeds and to maintain firebreaks. Often the way of enforcing these provisions is to allow a penalty to be a charge on the land. In this case the landowner, the body corporate, has no assets other than the land and the land cannot be touched. The land-holder will be able to use the land with immunity from the laws of the country. Therefore, there has to be very serious concern expressed about this particular amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do need to see a situation where native titleholders are in a position of cooperation with the laws with which they want general application for so many other provisions. Unfortunately, past experience, particularly in the Northern Territory, of these sorts of provisions is concerning. Very often these sorts of issues can be used as a tool for negotiation purposes and for achieving other objectives, and therefore I think this is a matter that needs serious attention from the government. It raises quite considerable reservations with regard to the amendment that is proposed and has quite severe implications on many people, adjoining landowners to native property throughout Australia. I would ask the minister to respond to my concerns and to say how these issues are going to be addressed. </PARA>

Again, this is not a unique situation, particularly following the events of the 1980s, as they are referred to, in that they would not really be in any different situation in this respect from, for example, a bankrupt in attempting to recover something from someone who had no assets. What this does is simply recognise the inalienable nature of the title itself. </PARA>

The point has been made at length in previous debates in this chamber and elsewhere that the right of conversion to native title equivalent may well not be exercised. Aboriginal people may not choose to exercise it because of the greater economic flexibility which non-native title provides. Native titleholders will still be able to receive grants and so on from bodies such as ATSIC but the land cannot be used as security, as Senator Tambling has pointed out, for the loan. The same thing applies here. Charges cannot be made on the land but the native titleholders can be sued if they transgress any land management issues and are charged with such an offence. </PARA>

The government asserts, I think correctly, that in the ordinary business of land management and particularly those matters of land management that would concern the government, that is, proper care of the property, proper provision for fire control and so on, there is no hindrance in this provision for those controls to be enforced on land-holders, for people to be charged and to have fines recovered if people have convictions recorded against them.

The overwhelming majority opinion in the Aboriginal community in Australia, from my own experience, is that that proposition is supported, but I concede to Senator Tambling that it is certainly an arguable proposition. The government's position is, on balance, that this is the correct position and, in real terms in the operation of the act, it will not prevent proper land management proceeding on properties that are owned by Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is implying that native title compensation can be paid to an individual rather than a body corporate. I am highlighting what I see as an inconsistency. If I have it right, amendment 23 is using `that person or another person'. How does that tie in with clause 53, which uses body corporate?

At this point in time, there is only one native title claim that has been settled, and that has been settled by the High Court in Mabo. No other native title has yet been tested. It would be an exercise that I think would be, frankly, a waste of taxpayers' resources in that it would be entirely speculative to try to peer in advance. Basically, one would have to second-guess the tribunals before they even started to operate by trying to assess in advance, firstly, those areas where native title could potentially exist, and then whether the claims made would succeed.

One cannot recover those charges from the land but one can recover them from the landowner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the way local authority laws operate, certainly in Queensland and I assume right around Australia, very often rates are owing on a property and the only recourse a local authority has is by taking the land. In many instances, particularly in relation to rates, owners disappear and there is no prospect of recovery, and all local authorities right around Australia&mdash;I should confine my remarks to Queensland that I am more familiar with&mdash;do take the land back and sell it to recover their rates. If local authorities were denied that opportunity, it would leave a fairly big hole in their budgets. If the shires of Torres and Cook, which look after the islands in the Torres Strait and most of the Cape York area, were prevented from recovering outstanding rates, that would have a major impact on their budgets.</PARA></TALK.START>

If the body corporate or the owner had no money but the services were provided for the land, that is the ultimate recovery mechanism.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever Senator Spindler opens his mouth and makes a statement to the media or to the chamber, he will have to ask himself whether we should ever believe him again. Similarly with the Greens; they have a strong commitment to this legislation and to the Aboriginal people. One would think that, of anyone, those Green senators would dedicate themselves to ensuring that this legislation was considered properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The days we have spent here have been a farce. It is absolutely crazy to have 76 senators and hundreds of staff here day in and day out for absolutely ludicrous hours&mdash;hours that take their toll of everybody's health. We said that when we wanted to set up a Senate select committee. The Senate has a very workable, worldwide respected committee system. The most appropriate body to deal with a bill with 238 clauses and in excess of 250 amendments is a Senate select committee or some other committee. In that way we could go through the detail of the administration, the constitutional aspects, the legal aspects and the practical aspects of what everyone has described, as Senator Evans described yesterday, as a highly complex piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> On clause after clause, the minister has not been able to answer detailed questions on the practicalities or the administrative ramifications of this legislation. He has admitted that we will have to rely on reams and reams of regulation to ensure that this is enacted. We have to rely, for example, on the states amending a whole series of pieces of legislation in relation to compulsory acquisition acts. This bill cannot work unless state governments right around this country amend compulsory acquisition acts and ensure that those amendments take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The urgency of this matter is a joke; it is simply not true. We know that all of these regulations need to be drafted. Senator Evans has assured us that somewhere in Canberra some bureaucrats and legal people are off drafting the regulations. I wonder who those people are, because most of the experts on this bill are sitting in the advisers boxes over there. We know that, under the normal arrangements, if things are done properly, it will take at least nine months to ensure those regulations are enacted. This bill cannot even be implemented until then and probably cannot be up and running until September or October next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the Greens and the Democrats have been mischievously misled by this government saying that this bill needs to be in place before Christmas so it can be up and running in the new year. Senator Evans knows, and his advisers know, that this bill cannot be operative before the states pass legislation which complies with this rapacious piece of legislation; legislation which takes so many powers away from state governments. We know that the matter of urgency is just a joke. The urgency is that this government built this legislation on what is a very fragile consensus of Aboriginal groups who, to my mind, are not representative of the Aboriginal communities and industry groups, which, one at a time, have now peeled away from the government. Even Mr Rick Farley from the National Farmers Federation, who was one of the strongest supporters of the initial piece of legislation, has pulled his support away from this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing is that every senator in this place knows, for different reasons, that this is an extremely important piece of legislation. It is important to those who have a deep and abiding interest in ensuring that Aboriginals' rights are respected and that Aboriginal welfare is looked after, that this matter be debated and that the legislation comes out in the correct form. It is a matter of serious concern for those of us who have a deep respect for ensuring that decision making is kept close to the people of Australia and that decisions in relation to land management are kept close to the people within the state parliaments, so that if state governments make a mistake they are answerable to their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate should be standing up for the rights of those people in the states; it is not. As Senator Hill said, the Democrats are here to keep the bastards honest; they are here to ensure that we are a House of review; they are here to ensure that we deal with legislation in great detail, because it does not happen in the House of Representatives. But, when we have&mdash;on the admission of the minister&mdash;the most complex piece of legislation that has come before the chamber for years and years, what do the Democrats do?

No bill in the history of the parliament has taken this long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a complex bill. Legislative debate was appropriate under the circumstances.

It is not unreasonable that there should be a generous time allotment for this. It is a generous time allotment, and it needs to be because there are some important issues there, such as Senator Vanstone's obsession about clause 11 and the constitutionality of it, which we will be happy to revisit in the generous 90 minutes that are available to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the question of the proposed new 196A and the question of the application of general state laws to particular situations involving the exercise of native title, and we are very happy to debate that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is about two minutes and 29 seconds more than those opposite deserve, given the way that they have been conducting this debate. They are lucky to get more than one second per clause, given the way in which those clauses have been the subject of discussion already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be serious for half a moment, the way this bill is constructed is to depend significantly on the way in which those definitions are written. Those opposite cannot understand many of those earlier clauses that we have been debating for 41 hours without reference to those definitions. A number of those opposite have made it perfectly clear that, even with reference to the definitions, they still cannot understand it. But it is perfectly true that it is relevant to discuss a number of these definitions. We have discussed the definitions&mdash;we have discussed them ad nauseam. Nonetheless, we are allowing those opposite 180 minutes, three hours, to pursue further issues that relate to these particular clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Chairman, let me just say again: the way the debate will be run will essentially be to follow the running sheet that has been set out. That means that, when we get to each one of these groups of clauses, there are other amendments, some of them triggered by these clauses but not strictly relating to them, which will be debated at that time in exactly the same way in which we have been going through the running sheet for the 41 3/4 hours that we have been debating that so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of each of these blocks of time the various amendments will then be put and the committee will divide as necessary in order to enable the majority will of the committee to be expressed upon them. The intention is that at the end of each block of time the government amendments will be put and the remaining Green and Democrat amendments will equally be put at the end of that period. So there needs to be anticipated some division time in addition to these particular blocks of time that are here set out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed that at the conclusion of the committee stage, when the bill has been hopefully approved, the finished bill will be reported to the Senate for the third reading. We would anticipate, of course, that the third reading debate would not need to be a protracted one at this stage of the process. The third reading is not presently the subject of this particular urgency motion but it will be dealt with on the basis that a reasonable time will be allowed for basic expressions of final position to be articulated, but that will be it. With a bit of luck&mdash;again I say with a bit of luck and a bit of assistance from those of us who do want to debate this in as orderly and measured way as appropriate&mdash;it is my hope and expectation that we will complete this debate no later than midnight tonight and hopefully rather earlier than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the circumstances, I repeat: this is a remarkably generous allotment of time. Already this bill has been debated in committee uphill and down dale. The whole subject matter of the bill from beginning to end has been debated in committee for 41 hours and 45 minutes. It is proposed to allow another seven hours of substantive debate on this, however much additional time is required on top of that for divisions. This will be by a very considerable margin the most scrutinised, most discussed, most worked over bill in the history of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite are unhappy about any provision that is in the bill or any omission from it, they have nobody else to blame but themselves because they have had ample opportunity to join with the government or to advance other amendments that would helpfully improve the bills in various ways. They have had ample opportunity to do that, but they have declined to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have been negative, destructive, whingeing and carping. They have utterly failed to understand the spirit in which this legislation has been brought forward&mdash;a spirit of resolving one of the great unresolved injustices in the history of this country&mdash;the capacity of Aboriginal people to enjoy the land rights that they were dispossessed of by white occupancy of this country. We understand that; the Democrats understand that; the Greens understand that; the community understands that. The only people who do not understand that are those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have shown themselves in their true colours. They have shown themselves as being totally indifferent, totally hostile to the values that underlie this legislation. They have shown themselves as being totally unwilling to improve the legislation in a constructive way even when they have been invited to do so. They have been whingeing hypocrites throughout the process of this debate. They have lost any residual credibility they might have had. They have lost any residual claim to respect they might have had in the community, and they have certainly lost any possible basis on which they could be applauded for their sensitivity and respect for the Aboriginal people of this country. </PARA>

Those opposite have made fools of themselves in the way they have handled it tactically.

They have been given a far greater go on this than they deserve. This is the most generous guillotine provision that I can ever recall in my 15 years in this parliament.

The task of the legislation was meant to put an end to the uncertainty created by the High Court in the Mabo No. 2 decision. This bill fails that test. The opposition has demonstrated that quite clearly so that clause by clause we have seen error after error shown by ministers in responding to questions. There is a great list of errors that Senator Evans has made in responding. We have seen again and again the complexity and the question that Senator Vanstone, I and others have pursued concerning clause 11.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier today that, on the very day that South Africa is getting rid of apartheid, this bill is creating it in this country.

That means justice and equity for all Australians, including the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not a fair bill; it is not a bill that brings about equity for all Australians. It heightens the uncertainty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome in the chamber those senseless sheep from the Labor Party who have kept out of this debate. They come into the chamber when they think something is on that might let them go home. I call them senseless sheep because when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, `We'll stay here as long as it takes'&mdash;joining the chorus of the Democrats&mdash;the Labor Party was prepared to say, `We'll debate this fully. We'll stay until Christmas Eve, we'll come back on Boxing Day&mdash;we'll do whatever needs to be done to give this sensible consideration'. Not one of us is saying that we will not do that. Those opposite are all nodding away in agreement, like the chickens at the pellet trough, saying, `The Prime Minister said this, we'll all agree'. Yesterday the Prime Minister decided to click his fingers and say all of sudden, `This is a filibuster'. So what do we have? We have all the senseless sheep coming down and saying, `This is a filibuster and we are not having anything to do with it'. It is amazing that, whatever the Prime Minister says, these people simply follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite Senator Gareth Evans's humungous ego at the best of times, he really took the cake this morning. He went past the award that we could ever possibly imagine giving someone for an ego. He said, `You don't understand the spirit with which this bill is put forward: the spirit of resolving one of the greatest injustices put on the Aboriginal community'. He thinks this bill is going to solve that. This bill is not going to solve that injustice; the High Court has already done that through Mabo No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite want to think that their good words and their good efforts have divined that injustice and done something about it, they should think again. Mabo No. 2 gives Aboriginals native title or gets rid of the notion of terra nullius. It is not what those opposite are doing at all. But he is trying to hog all the glory and says, `We're going to redress this injustice'. It is the High Court that has done that. What we are arguing about here is the best way to handle that decision. So let us not pretend with any moral outrage that those opposite have some divine insight into how to solve this problem or that they have any greater compassion for the Aboriginal community than us, simply because we may think that there is another way of responding to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument put forward as to why we should have this guillotine is that we have spent more time than ever before, as though time alone is the judge of whether or not a debate has been conducted properly. Plenty of people on this side would argue that this is one of the most important&mdash;perhaps the most important&mdash;bill to go through this place, and it deserves proper consideration. It is no surprise to us that the committee stage of this bill has taken longer than the committee stage of any other bill. By Senator Gareth Evans's own omission, it is a complex bill. Obviously we are going to spend more time on that than on any other bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tambling's interjection indicated, what we have been left with in this managed guillotine&mdash;that Senator Kernot says is such a good thing and that Senator Evans says we should be grateful to have&mdash;is two to three minutes a clause. Mr Chairman, if you look back to some of the answers that Senator Gareth Evans has given, you will see that he has taken more than six or seven minutes to answer one question with respect to a clause, and even then some of us have judged that it has not been an answer. But now we are being allowed two to three minutes a clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have the Democrats. Senator Spindler was out there with his shield against the community saying, `We'll be here until New Year's Day; they have picked the wrong people; we will never give in'. It reminds me of a poem: `Poor old Siddy got a bit giddy and made a promise he could not keep; if he had any pride, his face he would hide, and smile like a senseless sheep'. That is perfectly applicable to Senator Spindler. He was in here promising that he would be here forever and a day. Poor old Siddy got a bit giddy&mdash;that is what happened to him. The Democrats are here supporting a guillotine&mdash;a managed guillotine, they say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that has been raised is that we have no right to debate this bill. The senseless sheep on the other side said, `Hear, hear!' when that point was made. We have no right to debate this bill&mdash;that is what people on the other side have agreed to. How outrageous is that? Just because we do not agree with their version and move particular amendments to the bill, somehow these people say that we are deprived of our right to debate this bill clause by clause. </PARA>

This chamber will not be a debating or legislative chamber any more. We will meet outside in little groups in the phone boxes that those opposite meet in. We will say, `Hey, listen. Pssst! Do you agree with this bill? Okay, you can come in and say something'. If the answer to `Pssst, do you agree with this bill?' is, `No, I think there is a better way to go', then those opposite will say, `Bad luck about you. We are cutting down your debating rights. We do not even want to hear what you have to say. We are not remotely interested'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told by Senator Evans that the Christmas time frame has to be kept; in other words, we can say what we like until then, but when the time comes that the government wants its bill passed then the guillotine has to apply. The executive party, with all the sheep that follow their bosses because they are angling for a position, and the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;the family as we like to call them&mdash;get together and decide that this bill is going through. As a token, magnanimous gesture, some debate is allowed. But the bottom line is that no more debate is allowed than those opposite want because they have already made up their minds outside the chamber on what form the bill will take and when it will be passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot has said that the staff have approached the Democrats saying that we should have a guillotine and get out of this place. She asked why we on this side did not think of the staff. I wonder what Senator Kernot was thinking last night when she voted to keep the Senate going all night. I wonder whether any staff said to her then, `Pssst, can we please go home to our families?' and whether she paid any attention to that. The hypocrisy in this place!

Yesterday morning we made quite good progress because we had a couple of procedural motions to deal with.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, as such, does not recognise the right of the blackman to live. She marches onward, truly, but not perhaps the fair maiden we paint her. The blackfellow sees blood on that noble forehead, callous cruelty in her heart; her heel is of iron and his helpless countrymen beneath her feet. But we are strong and the blacks are weak; we have rifles, they but spears; we love British fairplay, and having got hold of this continent we must have every square foot. Little Tasmania is our model, and I fear, will be, until the great papers of Australia will chronicle, `with regret', the death of the last blackfellow. There is a feeling abroad too, which might be worded thus&mdash;it is in God's providence that the native races here, as elsewhere, must disappear before the British people. This, of course, I do not admit. The laws of nature, not God's providence, require that in given circumstances an inferior race will disappear before a superior, but so do they require that death will follow starvation, or be the consequence of poisoning.</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, this debate has amply and regrettably demonstrated something that was eloquently expressed to me yesterday by a prominent Aboriginal person who has been following the debate from the gallery: although 100 years have passed since that letter was written, and the face of Australia and its people have changed significantly, Aboriginal Australians are still far from achieving a secure and equal place in their own land. As occurred 10 minutes ago, analogies can still be drawn between measures such as this, to provide some measure of justice for Aboriginal people, and apartheid. It exposes the utter hypocrisy of the debate. It exposes the philosophical position the opposition has taken on this, which history will record very badly for the opposition when it is written in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few moments ago, Senator Macdonald said, `This bill is the most important bill that has come before the parliament'. One could be forgiven for not believing that, having regard to the way the opposition has treated it. This most important bill to come before this parliament was not the subject of a single, solitary opposition amendment&mdash;not one! A bill with over 200 clauses&mdash;on the word of Senator Macdonald, the most important piece of legislation brought into this parliament&mdash;and not a single amendment moved. Why? What was the responsible position of this alternative government to this piece of legislation for the people of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did the opposition determine that it would block the bill but, sight unseen, it took a policy decision in its party room to oppose every single, solitary amendment that the government moved. And the opposition proceeded to do so in the debate, sight unseen of the amendments, even when those same amendments unambiguously assist industry and were brought in at the request of industry. The Northern Territory fishing industry made representations to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in Darwin for amendments to be made to the bill. The very amendments that the Northern Territory fishing industry asked for were introduced into this chamber by the government and voted down by Senator Tambling and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only members of the coalition that still have some shred of support for the bush that they are supposed to represent and the industries that they are supposed to represent are three National Party of Australia senators who had the intelligence, the principle and the morality to cross this chamber and vote for their constituency. It would have been immoral to do otherwise because it was said to me afterwards&mdash;do you know why, Mr Chairman, the opposition members voted against those amendments that would favour industry?&mdash;when members were crossing the floor, that they voted for it deliberately to make it bad law from their point of view. Deliberately!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent 10 years in opposition, five of them as leader. Oppositions have a role to play: to expose the government, to test the government and to make the government accountable.

How irresponsible and immoral can it be&mdash;it is the height of irresponsibility and immorality in terms of service to the Australian parliament&mdash;when an opposition votes deliberately against a measure to make a bill worse from its perspective, to make it unworkable and to make it bad law. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing I agree with Senator Collins on is that this is a very important bill. It affects the rights not only of Aboriginal people but of all Australians. It is perfectly appropriate that the parliament does its job. It is perfectly appropriate that the parliament goes through this bill clause by clause and examines the implications for all Australians. It was entirely predictable, given the contempt of Senator Evans and his colleagues for the parliamentary process in the Senate, that they would act in the way that they did. No-one would argue that it was anything other than entirely predictable. It is a great pity, I think, that the two minor parties, the Greens and the Democrats, have chosen to accommodate the government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was brought on after the official end of the parliamentary sittings. The government deliberately brought on this bill to cram it between the official end of the parliamentary sittings and Christmas, knowing full well that in the end enormous pressure would be put on the Greens and the Democrats. I have to say, as Senator Spindler is in the chamber, that it was no surprise on this side that the Democrats conspired with the government in this act. Unfortunately, the record of the Democrats over the last 12 months has been not to play the role of a constructive opposition but to give aid and comfort to the government to impose bill after bill for which it has no mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that the Greens have also chosen to succumb. When we looked across this chamber we could see that the Greens had a genuine problem, and they agonised over it. There was an enormous pressure applied on them by Senator Gareth Evans, and I suspect the Democrats, to join with them in saying that the debate on this bill could be attenuated before Christmas. I do not care. In my view, this bill is of such importance that I would be very comfortable with sitting through. I think the people in this country want their parliaments to act in a way which will scrutinise carefully the legislation which comes before them to make sure that it is properly debated. </PARA>

There is no question about that. This proposal is one of reason. It gives us a structured framework for a debate. Everyone in this chamber knows that when we have a structured framework for debate, it concentrates the mind wonderfully, the level of debate rises and the contributions are better, more pointed and more purposeful. There is no question of that not eventuating. We are talking in terms of a national agenda, not the agenda for Richard Court and the Western Australian Liberal Party that many in the opposition have been endeavouring to run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is very important to the coalition at the moment. We recognise that. We acknowledge that. There are so many problems outside the chamber that the coalition needs to deal with. The leadership problems of the Liberal Party are on the front page of the newspapers every day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, the opposition is bankrupt of ideas on Mabo because of the utter failure of the national leadership within its own parliamentary party. In fact, the coalition has effectively been hoist with its own petard. It is said often that there are a number of people opposite not ready for government. In this debate, we have seen that there are a lot of people opposite not prepared to act responsibly in opposition. The opposition has been hoist with its own petard. The opposition resolved early and with utter rigidity, inflexibility and sterility not to contribute and not to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those opposite who now cry crocodile tears for a debate, let me say this: a debate requires two points of view. It requires an original position, which has been provided by the government; amendments, which have been provided by the Australian Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine; and an alternative. We will not accept for one moment Richard Court's legislation as a legitimate national alternative. It is not a legitimate national alternative, but it is the agenda that the federal Liberal Party has been running. Senator Campbell is aware of that; he is too clever not to be. The Court agenda is not an acceptable national alternative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were interrupted by Senator Gareth Evans, I was asking a question of the minister who was then involved. I am not quite sure who is involved now; Senator Collins obviously had little idea of what he was talking about. I hope that Senator Evans is back to deal with this matter. I was trying to raise the question of what impact the amendments, by addition of subclause (7) to clause 53, would have on local authorities around Australia. Senator Collins&mdash;who clearly demonstrated that he had no idea&mdash;was telling me that local authorities could not collect rate money by dealing with the land, as happens with every other Australian. Senator Collins was indicating that that would not have much effect anyway because there was not much money involved, again clearly demonstrating his ignorance of these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Senator Evans appreciates that being able to recover money will have a major impact on local authority finances. Very often owners abandon land, walk away and there are huge amounts of rates owing. The only way out is to deal with the land. I was trying to get a sensible comment from the minister on how this will affect local governments in their ability to recover moneys owing. I emphasise that very often rates are owing because local authorities have actually provided services to land and the only way they can recover the money is through rates. If people refuse to pay them, their only recourse is to deal with the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the minister could explain to me how this would happen. In the case of a body corporate, if the body corporate has no money and is sued, where does that leave the local authority?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only restriction that is imposed by the legislation in this particular subclause, which is incorporated by way of amendment, is upon the sale of the land itself. It would be incompatible with the very concept of native title that land could be sold off for defaults of that kind. It is not true of native title equivalent, which might be given in the context of a pastoral lease conversion exercise, as we said yesterday. The pastoral lease in that situation would certainly be able to be sold and the native title equivalent holders would be left lamenting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remedy for the aggrieved local government authority, or whoever in this situation, would still be, for example, to have a forced sale of stock, farm machinery or other movable assets of that particular kind which were not the land itself but did represent a realisable asset. A sale of stock is the obvious way to get at someone who is defaulting on a debt in this kind of situation. Given the order of magnitude of the debts compared with the likely value of the stock in any pastoral exercise, that is probably a realistically available route to go. </PARA>

It is related to the character of the title we are talking about here, which is different in kind, quality and nature from other forms of interest in land and justifies, in our judgment, that degree of discrimination. We do need to think in terms of the other alternative remedies that are available. Perhaps some further thought could be given to other possibilities in the situation where there is no easily realisable stock or machinery. It is a fair point that Senator Macdonald is making, but it is one that, hopefully, will not arise too often in practice.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to Greens amendment 1A, which has already been circulated and moved. It has also been debated already but was deferred to this point until the corporate body amendments were dealt with. The purpose of the amendment is simply to ensure that this bill does not have the unintended effect of denying Aboriginal and Islander people protection against existing discriminatory laws, either state or federal. Clause 6A ensures that the bill, like all other laws, will be interpreted as not affecting the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act and will thereby implement parliament's intention. Subclause (2) ensures that the validation of past acts by or in accordance with this act are not affected by the clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of questions which relate to clauses 52 and 53. In relation to clause 52, Senator Ellison earlier today asked about the moneys being a statutory appropriation and coming from the consolidated revenue fund. I would like the minister, when he gets the opportunity, to address why that is applicable and why it cannot be a matter of normal appropriations that are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. I am sure there are good reasons for it, but I think the chamber and the people of Australia deserve to know why this is a unique situation and why it should be a standing appropriation under that clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to raise some points under clause 53, which  returns us to the hoary chestnut that we have spent a couple of hours debating; that is, the use of the body corporates to be the trustees on behalf of the native titleholders. We have already debated whether or not section 10(3) of the Racial Discrimination Act could be jeopardised. The key point is, where the body corporate is acting on behalf of the common law holders and where an agreement made by a body corporate needs to be binding on the common law holders, what does the government envisage the mechanisms would be for dealing, for example, with minority interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a group of native titleholders appointed a body corporate to act on its behalf under this clause, and a minority interest disagreed with the decision, representation or action of the body corporate, the situation may arise where there may be no consensus. Could the minister suggest to us whether or not the general provisions of company law and corporations as we know them would apply? If that is the case, are the normal roles of directors to apply to these body corporates?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister did indicate in earlier debate when this came up under another clause that these things would need to be subject to regulation and further decisions, but the minister also told us that these regulations were in an advanced state of drafting. If that is the case, the chamber needs to know how this problem is going to be resolved. Under the Mabo High Court decision and the Racial Discrimination Act, 10(3), there is quite a clear message that taking away the management of the land from the native titleholders would be contravening the RDA. I do not want to reopen that debate; we do not have the time to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial question comes down to the relationship between the native titleholders and the body corporate. Where a dispute arises between the native titleholders and the body corporate itself, clearly one can arrive at a situation where there are a number of native title parties. If such a dispute arose, they would have cause for action where it was clearly demonstrable that the body corporate was not acting in the interests of a native title party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first question about Commonwealth compensation being payable from consolidated revenue under clause 52, I am advised that is a quite normal provision in any statutory environment where liability is established or determined by other provisions of the legislation. In this instance, the reference is to</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . compensation payable by the Commonwealth in accordance with this Division&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . amounts to be spent by the Commonwealth in acquiring property or providing goods or services&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in order to comply with a specific form of possible recommendation by the tribunal, set out in 49(6)(b). It is perfectly normal for legislation to contain an appropriation clause in order to give the statutory authority for the appropriation of moneys to meet those liabilities. Otherwise, we would have to have in the annual appropriations each year a specific authority to pay amounts of compensation determined in the preceding year or in anticipation of the subsequent year. There has to be statutory authority somewhere for the moneys to be actually taken out of consolidated revenue, and this is it&mdash;and it is a very common provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell's second query goes to decision making practices, so far as the body corporate is concerned in its relationship with the individual titleholders and perhaps a dissident minority and so on. Basically, these rules will be the subject of prescription under regulations. Under our amendment 75, clause 53A(4) says that the regulations may make provision, among other things, for the nature of any consultation with common law holders. Again, 53C(d) enables regulations with respect to consultation with and actions taken in accordance with the directions of the common law holders in performing any of their functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would envisage, among other things, regulations under these particular clauses being of a similar character to the Northern Territory land rights legislation. In terms of dealing with this question of consents of traditional Aboriginal owners, there is, for example, a reference in section 77A of the 1976 act which says that regard must be had to traditional Aboriginal decision making processes. They are not necessarily majority-minority voting processes but rather consultative and consensual in character. It may be that evidence would need to be taken if there were any dispute as to respective minority versus majority interests as to the nature of those decision making processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying in short is that this is clearly an issue that has to be addressed in order that we get certainty in all the kinds of decisions that have to be made and subsequently implemented. A greater degree of certainty is expected to be invested by the regulations once they are promulgated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What happens if native title applicants, of which the minister has already admitted there could be a number, do nominate a number of bodies corporate to represent them? Clearly there would be a dispute that would certainly need to be resolved to overcome the RDA problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in subsection (4) the legislation alludes to the `prescribed bodies'. Does the minister envisage a whole range of new bodies being incorporated, formed or created; or is it safe to assume that, in the real world, the lands councils that exist already are most likely to take on those roles; and how far have the regulations got in the drafting of those?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to clause 54(2), which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The body corporate must, in accordance with the regulation, also hold or deal with any other amount that may be paid to it as a result of any agreement in relation to the surrender&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which we have already dealt with. We know that it can be surrendered to the Commonwealth. But it also refers to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">transfer or other dealing with the native title rights and interests that may be authorised by the regulations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have not, in the entire arduous debate we have had on this subject, heard any reference to&mdash;and I cannot find any in the legislation&mdash;anything that can be done with the native title rights other than to surrender them to the Crown. Leases can obviously be issued, and so forth, but the word `transfer' certainly connotates a transfer of the native title right. If that is the case, we should be told by the government how that transfer is envisaged and between what parties some transfer could take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the latter question, it is the case that the only formal provision for alienation of the interest that the legislation deals with is the surrender to the Crown, but it needs to be remembered that the common law native title may itself be transferable, alienable, in accordance with the particular principles that govern that community as identified and determined by the courts. It may be that in a particular part of the country the notion of property transfer was in fact sufficiently well developed to enable that to be picked up and applied in a modern day context. That option is still open. But, apart from that, Senator Campbell is right; it is just the surrender situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of who might be prescribed bodies, it is certainly not intended that the land councils be bodies for this purpose. What we are talking about is specifically established bodies corporate&mdash;no more than one for each native title situation. We are not envisaging a multiplicity of them. The whole point of the exercise is to have a clearly discernible legal entity which can be the vehicle through which the rest of the world can deal with the title situation. As we have said several times, whether or not the title itself is formally vested in the body corporate will now be a matter of option, but the body corporate must itself exist at least as the agent of the native titleholders in order that there is that capacity to effectively deal in a modern day context where people cannot be expected to go out in the bush and have traditional meetings in order to do basic transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to what kind of bodies may be prescribed bodies, I think the concepts that are broadly available are formal non-profit corporate entities under various corporations law statutes around the place or trust arrangements of one kind or another. I am also reminded that there is a Commonwealth Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act in existence which, through this creation of a kind of statutory corporate entity, creates another class of entities that would satisfy the kind of thing that this clause has in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Arising out of the questioning of the minister by Senator Campbell in relation to the transfer of native title&mdash;it is not on that point but flows from it&mdash;I am concerned with the vesting of compensation in a prescribed corporate body. What happens to it after that? I take it that the legislation says, `As soon as it is paid to the corporate body, that is the end of it'. What I am looking at is where the community is made up of women, children, elders and infants&mdash;in other words, a wide range of people. Does the body corporate have to hold on to it for the benefit of the children or can it all be blown in one go?  What is the story there?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The distribution of funds in that situation would be entirely at the discretion of the native titleholders themselves. These bodies corporate are not intended to be independent exercisers of power or authority. They are merely meant to be a formal legal vehicle through which the majority or other will, however determined, of the community can prevail. I hesitate to use the word `majority' because communal practices of the Aboriginal titleholders might not operate on a majoritarian principle. It might be a consensual principle of the kind that we have talked about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept clearly is that the body corporate has no independent decision making authority or no role to play otherwise than as a vehicle for the will to be exercised of the individual people who make up the native titleholders. How that works in practice will depend from situation to situation. That is why the legislation is fairly flexibly drafted in terms of the kinds of bodies that might have body corporate status. The relationship between the body corporate and the native titleholders is intended to be pretty clear. I think it is clear in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Tambling said, this is one of a group of similar amendments which remove the requirement that native titleholders establish a prima facie case in respect of applications for determination or variation of native title or compensation where that application is resolved by agreement between the parties. If there is agreement, it is thought not appropriate to put the applicants to the difficulties and the expense of establishing a prima facie case with the documentation and so on that would need to be associated with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But&mdash;and this is the important but&mdash;the tribunal instead will have to be satisfied that the agreed determination would be appropriate in the circumstances, and if there is any character of sham about the arrangement then the tribunal could be expected to identify that and deal with it appropriately. For completeness in explaining this amendment I should say that where an application is unopposed, a prima facie case would still have to be established in order to satisfy the tribunal and similar amendments are made to clauses 66 and 80. The requirement that the tribunal be satisfied about appropriateness is, I suppose, a slightly lower test than the prima facie case test, but it is still enough to demonstrate clearly that the tribunal has an obligation to satisfy itself that this is not a sham kind of transaction that is being entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that is worth making is that the parties in this determination process would include any objectors to the claim, and that could well be a state government. It is not a matter simply of the parties, for the purpose of the determination process and the endorsement process, being the native title claimants and the miner or whoever they have reached agreement with. It would also be perfectly competent for a state government to play that role, and it might be expected that a state government would be conscious of the need to maintain the integrity of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one further point that is worth making. In most judicial proceedings, including those completely removed from this Aboriginal context, the court does not inquire at all into an agreement reached between parties. Life is too short for courts to be peering behind a particular result. Here, however, the tribunal is given that role because of a conscious decision on the Commonwealth government's part to introduce some such safety net, if you like, to guard against just the kind of concerns that Senator Tambling has expressed. </PARA>

That will always cast them in the role of the seeming opponent. I am certainly aware that whenever the Northern Territory government has had to take that particular role with regard to testing Aboriginal claims under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act it has always been painted into the picture, when it seeks to represent a community view or a community interest, as therefore being the ogre who is at all times seeking to oppose any Aboriginal claimant.

I would have thought it is the tribunal itself rather than the state or territory government that would be properly described as the guardian of the process. In fact, that is the description I used in that context.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are answers to all of those questions. As to Senator Ellison's first question, it is the case that regulations will be needed to more specifically prescribe the information that is required to be submitted with an application. It will not be left to just the rather broad language of clauses 56 and 57. Those regulations are being drafted at the moment and are expected to be ready for promulgation if not by 1 January then certainly quite soon thereafter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator Ellison asks about different clans wanting to make different sorts of claims. It is the case that multiple applications can be made and in some situations they are quite likely to be made. One of the reasons for the very broad notification provisions in the legislation is to ensure that all relevant interests including, possibly, competing interests, are picked up in the application and subsequent determination process.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, it is for the tribunal to sort out who is entitled to what so far as native title status is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be appreciated&mdash;I do not think this point has been made before in the 40-odd hours we have been debating this bill, but I think it is quite a relevant one&mdash;that we could envisage a situation of multiple determinations of native title rights with respect to the same area of ground. One native title right vested in one particular claimant might be a kind of leasehold interest&mdash;to try to translate that into contemporary property law terminology. Another kind of native title interest that could perhaps exist simultaneously with that might be one that was confined to access rights, rights of entrance to visit a particular sacred site, or perhaps a hunting-foraging right of that kind&mdash;native title right expressed in rather more limited terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is envisaged that the process of determining competing claims and of possibly resolving situations of overlapping claims will be, in some cases, a quite complex one, but I think the tribunal will have sufficient flexibility and authority to unravel it. Part of the consideration it will have in mind is the necessity of having the maximum possible clarity about the nature and extent of that title, particularly when it affects dealings with third parties, be it governments, mining companies, other pastoralists or whatever. They are the issues that will need to be sorted out by the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of possibly less sophisticated native title applicants being required to swear formal affidavits and so on, that is not really what is contemplated by clause 56. Senator Ellison will notice that paragraph 56(1)(c) talks in terms of the name and address of the person who is to be taken to be the claimant. That is intended to confer a kind of representative status on one individual, perhaps on behalf of the other applicants in his group. There will need to be some identification of who all the applicants are, but, in terms of having declarations by applicants and so on, it is envisaged that one such declaration by one such individual, provided he or she is representative, will probably be sufficient for that purpose and that is the person who has to be named for the purposes of paragraph 56(1)(c). </PARA>

That would be a catch-all provision that would, no doubt, ensure that finance companies that perhaps have some kind of charge over the property in question&mdash;maybe over stock or something on that property&mdash;would be notified about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The registrar is not making a final determination about frivolity or vexatiousness or the absence of a prima facie case. The most that the registrar is doing is operating, in the first instance, as a vehicle for the presiding member making that decision if the registrar thinks there are grounds on which that might be an appropriate decision. So there is a separation of functions. The registrar who does play this kind of more active assistance role is not the person who actually decides, under the revised language in front of us, that the application ought to be struck from the register. That is for someone else who has not been as close to the circumstances of it to decide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there is a later provision in the legislation regarding objectors. It is not a matter of an objector, once the claim has survived the first process, then going directly to a presiding officer; it is a matter of an objector's application to strike out being made to the tribunal itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is precisely the position that pertained under the old clause 57. There is that conflict of interest where he assists in the drafting of an application which he is then required to judge as to whether it is frivolous or vexatious. Clearly, he will not. All the minister can say is, `That's all right, but the tribunal could do it later'. What is the point of giving him that discretion at that stage when he will clearly be in a position of conflict?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Alston is just being obtuse or whether he is being obstreperous. There is no conflict of interest because the registrar has no final say to determine whether an application is frivolous or vexatious. If he had a final say to rub something out on that basis, there might be a problem because of the conflict of interest or whatever that Senator Alston identifies, given his role in the assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not concerned that the registrar might say that it is frivolous and vexatious; we are concerned he will say it is not, because he has helped draft it. Therefore, it would not get referred to the other officer; it would be a matter of the tribunal having to be wheeled in at greater expense at a later point in time. The whole purpose of the exercise is that if he has that obligation in the first instance to make an impartial assessment as to whether it is frivolous or vexatious, he is hardly likely to carry that out impartially if he has helped draft it. If the minister cannot see that, he has a bigger problem than I thought.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not see any particular problem here. It is a question of how many powers Senator Alston wants to vest in the registrar. The role we envisage for the registrar is essentially just an administrative role to ensure that appropriate notifications are made, that a proper register is maintained of competing applications and that all relevant information is gathered. It is the tribunal that is the basic determining body. However, there is a fast-track process here provided in the no doubt exceptional case where the application is so insubstantial that the registrar himself believes that he ought not to be in the business of going ahead and putting it on the register. Under those circumstances, he can fast-track the process of knocking it off by giving it to a presiding officer if he cannot do the job himself. The usual working assumption is that the registrar is not a decision making judicial type of officer. The registrar is just an administrative officer whose basic job is to run a proper registry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 62 relates to the determination as to the parties. I appreciate that clause 61 provides for the sorting out of who is a party. Clause 62(1) says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The term `conclusive' interested me because I wondered whether that ruled out any review. If the tribunal said to an aggrieved party, `You haven't got any interests sufficient to be included in this action' and the aggrieved party was cheesed off about that and said, `Yes, I most definitely have', does the word `conclusive' thereby end the matter and mean that the aggrieved party has no further redress?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably a fair point because `conclusive' does not mean conclusive. As I understand it&mdash;I am not sure how much administrative law I understand these days because it is a while since I practised it&mdash;we cannot purport to rule out consideration of these issues by the courts on a judicial review basis if there is legitimate ground for doing so as a matter of administrative law. I will try to find out why the word `conclusive' was used under those circumstances. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that it is conclusive because there is an appeal right provided from this decision in clause 161. I had thought that the reference to `conclusive' and `appeal rights' was to indicate that this was not something for which an appeal right was provided as a right but which, nonetheless, would still allow one to go to administrative law of redress, even in the absence of an appeal, but that does not seem to be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this is something that is of gigantic significance. We had better ask the Parliamentary Counsel to have another look at this in the process of reviewing operation of the legislation generally. I do not think it will affect anyone's rights and entitlements. Clearly, there is an appeal right but it may be inappropriate terminology under the circumstances. There are two reasons why the word `conclusive' seems inappropriate: first, because there is an appeal right expressly provided for in 161; secondly, because the word `conclusive' cannot, as I understand the law, exclude the possibility of an ADJR-type application to the courts anyway under the judicial review principles. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments which I have introduced have been circulated previously. In moving these amendments to clauses 163 to 169, the Greens are making it clear that they oppose the possibility of gaol terms for offences under this act. The offences listed under the act relate to the conduct of the tribunal hearings, including refusal to be sworn to answer questions, failure of a witness to attend and the giving of false or misleading statements. It is our contention that gaol terms for such offences are wholly inappropriate. </PARA>

But taking it seriously, as I am obliged to do for the sake of this debate, I would say that while a discretion is pretty close to absolute, I guess, in terms of the literal way in which the section is draw, if one wants to apply some ejusdem generis principle to subparagraphs (i) to (v), one would see that what is being referred to here are the hearings or proceedings of other reasonably formal bodies that exist around the place, or which have existed, and which have taken evidence in relation to relevant matters: for example, the land commissioners under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory; for example, the Queensland Aboriginal Land Tribunal, which has conducted proceedings of this kind for some time now; for example, the Seimen commission in Western Australia some years ago which conducted a major examination and investigation of a number of entirely relevant issues in the context of these sorts of inquiries and determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certainly plenty of instances around of formally constituted inquiries of one kind or another that might be regarded as being of the same general character or class as those particular bodies or institutions specifically referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (iv). If a court was minded to want to limit the scope of its own capacity to take this kind of evidence and wanted to read down subparagraph (v), there would be ample credible basis on which to do so by reference to the kind of other bodies that I have mentioned. If it wanted to give those words their maximum possible range and effect, I still believe it would be entitled to do so provided the kind of evidence that was taken was manifestly relevant and bore upon the proceedings. If it was not relevant and if it was taken into account and given undue or improper weigh, then, as I said at the outset, there would be ground for appeal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not asking the minister; that is what he has said. The fact of the matter is that the government has set out in clause 75 that there is to be a different standard, a different set and a different way in which a court of the Australian legal system shall operate for native title and no other sort of title. In other words, when it concerns native title the court, under clause 75(3), in conducting proceedings, shall not be bound by technicalities, legal forms or the rules of evidence. Australians who are not Aboriginals will be bound by the rules of evidence if they appear before the Federal Court. The point I am making is that, within clause 75, we have a provision that the court is to behave in a certain way in respect of Aboriginal Australians&mdash;in a way that it will not behave in respect of any other Australian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 76 requires that the Chief Judge of the Federal Court is to appoint an assessor in relation to each proceeding. He is to direct an assessor to assist the Federal Court. We have already pointed out in earlier debate that an assessor may only be a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander race. So we have two provisions now which are discriminating. If this legislation is to be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act, presumably these provisions will be struck down because they are quite clearly discriminatory and they do not meet the temporary provisions as reflected in section 8. Clause 75(2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court, in conducting proceedings, must take account of the cultural and customary concerns . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? When dealing with the question of not being bound by technicalities, does that include privilege between a lawyer and his or her client? Does that mean that a lawyer can be compelled to come before the court and give evidence as to what has occurred between that lawyer and his or her client?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will deal with those two questions first. Why does this bill make a distinction between the way Aboriginal Australians are treated when they come before the Federal Court and the way all other Australians are treated when they come before the Federal Court?

That, Senator Bishop, is simply not true. Senator Bishop has not understood the freehold test, which does recur in a number of different contexts in the bill. It is not a test which says that it has to be dealt with in the same way as freehold title; it says, rather, that, for the purpose of determining whether or not what are described by the legislation as future acts can take place with respect to native title, the test to apply is whether or not those same acts can take place with respect to ordinary owners of freehold title. That is a very different thing from saying that native title is to be treated in the same way as freehold title. In all sorts of ways, native title is not to be treated in the same way as freehold title. It is not amenable in the same way and so on.

We do regard it as a matter that requires to be approached with a very special kind of sensitivity and a very special kind of understanding. We do regard the particular subject matter as being of a character, demanding as it does not just evidence to be determined about physical location and movement and relativities of particular people and genealogies and so on, but requiring as it does evidence to be taken and weighed about spiritual life of communities and cultural norms with which we in this community are unfamiliar&mdash;issues which are not normally the provenance of the courts of this land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because these issues will come into play and be relevant in the determination of a great many issues that will arise about the nature and extent of the native title that is enjoyed, because the very nature of native title, as it is described by the court, is highly variable in content, depending on the particular circumstances, there is a situation that cries out for the exercise of flexibility by the tribunals that are making these initial determinations and by the courts that are dealing with issues that arise out of those determinations or other processes. It cries out for a different kind of approach from that which has traditionally been associated with court procedure. It cries out for a good deal of the flexibility that has more traditionally been associated with tribunal procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is no suggestion in any of this that the courts will be tearing up the rule book entirely. There is no ground for any suggestion that they would be using this as an opportunity to cut a swath through the familiar rules of legal professional privilege and other foundations of the law of evidence and associated jurisprudence. However, I do remind Senator Bishop, since she likes to think of herself as a lawyer on these occasions&mdash;whatever the evidence may be to the contrary&mdash;that there is plenty of legal authority for a court to be a court and to be regarded as such and to still retain its judicial character, notwithstanding it is created or given a jurisdiction on a more flexible basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I remind Senator Bishop&mdash;I use the legal politeness of `remind'; no doubt she is hearing of it for the first time&mdash;of the case of Peacock vs. Newtown Marrickville and General Co-Operative Building Society No. 4 Limited (1943) volume 67 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 25. In that case the court held that a body may be a court although it is directed to act `without regard to technicalities or legal forms, is not bound by the rules of evidence and is empowered to inform its mind on any matter in such manner as it thinks fit'. In that case it was said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technicalities and legal forms and rules of evidence may be varied indefinitely without depriving a tribunal of a judicial character.</PARA>
<PARA>That is at page 36 of that report. A body that was exonerated from all rules of law and equity would not however be a judicial body. I draw that to Senator Bishop's attention. Whether she takes any notice of it or not is always a good question in these cases; no doubt we will get some simplistic burst in response, with the black hat back on and the teeth bared. But the point is there is ample precedent, at least in the theory of the law as has been articulated by the High Court, for allowing degrees of flexibility of the kind that are clearly contemplated in this legislation while still maintaining the character of the body in question as a court and the character of the proceeding as a judicial proceeding. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In assisting the Court, the assessor is not to exercise any judicial power of the Court.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the last subclause is the answer to the boilermakers issue that Senator Alston raises in the sense that there is a very clear legislative direction that no shred of the judicial authority of the court is to be exercised by the non-judicial component that is here added to the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised&mdash;I will not say I am reminded&mdash;that in the UK, the court of appeal and the House of Lords may sit with assessors. That is the subject of various authorities and precedents, mainly of a maritime character, by appearances of the cases there referred to. I acknowledge that they are not constrained by constitutional technicalities about non-mixing and judicial and non-judicial power. But I think care has been taken to make clear the limits of the assessor's role in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the whole point about creating this role of assessors is to ensure that Federal Court judges, who cannot be assumed to have had much experience in any of the issues that they will be confronted with in dealing with these sorts of cases, will at least have another source of advice and assistance open to them in the conduct of proceedings which may amount to some extra help in wending their way through these minefields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is made that the traditional context in which assessors have been used, those maritime ones I have mentioned, have involved collisions between ships at sea. The sorts of issues that one has embarked upon resolving here to do with government native title, by their very character, are infinitely more complex than the sorts of issues that traditionally have been regarded by a common law Anglo-Saxon legal system as justifying assessors. I think that in those circumstances this is another innovation that should be applauded rather than being greeted with the kind of angst that it seems to generate in the tory breast on these occasions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister knows full well that the traditional role of an assessor is to assist. In most instances an assessor has no vote; in other words, an assessor does not profess to express an opinion because he or she is clearly not intended to exercise any judicial function. An assessor simply advises the decision maker, usually on technical matters. Those matters are not confined to maritime matters; engineers are quite commonly employed in that capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an entirely different situation. In this case the judicial decision maker is vacating the field. He is allowing the conference to be presided over by the assessor who, to all intents and purposes, conducts the proceedings. That assessor then proceeds without any limitations to be in a position to deny rights of cross-examination and re-examination; to decide that certain conferences shall be held in private; and in a whole range of ways to make decisions and exercise functions that are clearly judicial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore ask the minister again: what opinion has he obtained in relation to the boilermakers case? He and I well know that no court will be fooled by 76(3). If we look at the reality of the matter and not the forms, the court will clearly have to make a judgment about whether, in fact, assessors are exercising judicial functions. I would have thought anyone who presides over proceedings to the exclusion of a judge and makes decisions about the rules of evidence and the way in which evidence is to be taken is clearly exercising a judicial function. If the minister has advice to the contrary, I think he ought to produce it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make a point about clause 75 (1). I guess most Australians would probably think it was fairly acceptable to instruct a court to be fair, just, economical and prompt.

I guess that is left to the court's own devices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it raises a very serious issue of the authority of the Federal Court and the respect for the law. I think it is a fundamental responsibility of the parliament to ensure the maintenance of the authority of the law and respect for the law. When the Family Court was set up there was this approach of informality, which I think was somewhat naive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some assert that this approach of informality has caused the problems in the Family Court. When judges are sitting there deciding property, custody and other massive issues that affect people's lives, the element of informality has been a significant problem. It may well have contributed to some of the tragic and awful attacks on Family Court judges and others in the sense that participants in the process have had their authority and respect for the law depleted and diminished by the very informality of the process. I wonder whether the government is conscious of this potential and significant issue. </PARA>

<PARA>to come back to clause 11. It was postponed on Saturday because the government at that stage decided not to proceed with its proposed amendment. I suspect that the government withdrew that amendment because it found that it did not constitutionally provide what it wanted it to provide. At that time the government indicated that the Greens' amendment to clause 196, proposed clause 196A dealing with preservation of right to carry on activities, would, in fact, take its place. The proposed Greens amendment was an attempt to cover for the government what it was attempting to achieve by virtue of the amendment to clause 11 that it had withdrawn. As I understand it, there has been no change in those matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation that the coalition wanted to draw attention to in this respect is that mistakes have been made before with the application of section 109 of the constitution when we have legislation, both federal and state, operating at the same time. In the earlier debate I drew attention to the fact that the government had once before implemented a piece of legislation&mdash;it was the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;the consequence of which was that the New South Wales Racial Discrimination Act was held to be invalid. The reason it was held to be invalid is because section 109 of the constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.</PARA>
<PARA>The point that was made in the earlier debate was that in clause 11 of the Native Title Bill the government specifically uses the phrase `a law of the Commonwealth' which comes from section 109 of the constitution. The government is clearly trying to say that, by virtue of a variety of powers, it has the capacity to put through this bill and that the Commonwealth bill will take supremacy over any state laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of that may well be that state laws in that area are invalid. But the government did not want that to happen. However, the constitution says that if the federal parliament has the power to cover a particular field, the way to resolve a dispute between the federal government and the state governments is to say, `The state laws drop off to the extent that they are inconsistent'. That is what the constitution says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know by this country's record of dismal failure in trying to amend the constitution, we cannot amend the constitution simply by an act of Parliament. It has to be amended by a referendum. We cannot just say at any particular time, `Look, this constitution doesn't suit us. We know it says that but we don't want it to work out that way. This time, even though we might doing something the constitution says will have this effect, we'll try to put it in the legislation a clause which says, "No, it doesn't"'. That is the simple point that needs to be made. The government cannot, by virtue of writing in a clause, announce that its bill does not have the effect that it wants it to have. That is what we say the government was trying to do with the original amendment that was proposed to clause 11. The government now wants to rephrase that clause in some way and preserve rights that might otherwise exist by virtue of proposed clause 196A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, the minister raised a number of examples to indicate that we were off the track. These constitutional things get a bit one way or the other. I note that even the High Court does not reach unanimous judgments on these things all the time. None of us is saying that it is 100 per cent certain that the government is wrong. What we are saying is that there is a good case to make out on the other side and it deserves more than cursory treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mean by that that the minister has tried to give it cursory treatment. In fact, he has been good enough to get some legal opinion for us on the matter. We have gone through the examples that the minister offered. He said that it is not uncommon for the federal government to be taking up a common law in its statutes in some sort of general wording. The minister used as an example section 80 of the Judiciary Act and quoted from that. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a general lifting up of that applicable body of common law and making it part of the law of the Commonwealth so far as the exercise of federal jurisdiction by these Commonwealth courts being created by this proposed act is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, that is true. He then went on to mention the Crimes Act 1914, as subsequently amended, and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We could hardly find a much more general provision than that lifting up a whole body of common law&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that may be true&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and giving it the force and effect of Commonwealth statute law.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just not the sort of example that we wanted the government to find. We wanted to see if it could find one example, but it cannot find one. I will try to reword this because I can see that the adviser looks confused. It is late in the day and maybe everyone is not as articulate as they otherwise might be. I will try to put it as plainly and simply as I can. What we are pretty sure that the government is not able to find is an example whereby, in a couple of lines in a statute, the government has purported to use a variety of powers to take up a new legislative area and has done so using the wording in section 109 of the constitution to explicitly make it clear&mdash;which is what the government wants to do&mdash;that it wants to override the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Judiciary Act does not try to do that. The Crimes Act does not try to do that. All we want is some sort of precedent for taking up a body of common law. The government has given us that, but more than that; it is only the first limb of it. It is taking up a body of common law and applying it as a law of the Commonwealth, with the force of Commonwealth law, using the words of section 109. This is a clear indication that the federal government has now decided that this is an area where, to the extent of inconsistency, the states are to be squashed out. The government has not given us such an example. We say that that is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the examples that the minister has given&mdash;presumably he can understand what I am saying&mdash;he has not given such an example. This is a very novel extension. One might argue that it is a novel extension of Commonwealth power, and no doubt that will be argued in the courts. But it is also a novel use of section 109. To the best of our knowledge, it has never been done before. All we asked for was an example. The minister has not come up with one. Has he since then been able to find one?</PARA>

The point at issue here is not whether there is a particular precedent for this precise form of words, but whether there is authority for words having the effect of these particular words in statutes, or in other ways that have been recognised by the High Court. The truth of the matter is that there is ample such authority. I will quote from the opinion of the Acting Solicitor-General of Australia, Dennis Rose QC, which I sought yesterday in response to a request from Senator Vanstone and which I tabled last night. Paragraph 15 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it were objected against clause 11 that it provides for the common law to have the `force of law' rather than providing that, for example, the rules of the common law `shall apply . . . . . . ' . . . the objection would entirely lack merit. The High Court is familiar with the concept of statutes giving the force of law to the provisions of an agreement&mdash;ie. of creating statutory rights and obligations over and above common law contractual obligations (eg. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sankey v Whitlam</EMPHASIS> (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 31, 89). Section 11 would be accorded an exactly similar effect in giving the force of law to the provisions of the common law in respect of native title.</PARA>
<PARA>Other aspects of this opinion deal with the suggestion of Senator Vanstone yesterday that this section might be void for uncertainty. Another paragraph of the opinion deals with the expression in the case of Jackson v. Gambol about the `law of the Commonwealth', being an expression `not appropriate to describe a rule or principle of the common law'. That is explained and put in context and, clearly, it does not determine the matter in issue here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the particular issues that have been raised by Senator Vanstone, I do not want to go on at nauseous length about the issues here. I suppose it is always going to be a matter of competing legal judgments. We will not know the answer to this question until it is tested. On the particular issues that Senator Vanstone has raised, the Commonwealth is completely confident of its position and a summary expression of that confidence is contained in the Rose advice. It might be helpful for those who might ever be minded to look back at these proceedings if the text of that advice were to be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIVE TITLE BILL 1993, CLAUSE 11</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OPINION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been asked whether clause 11 of the Native Title Bill 1993, if enacted in the terms set out below, would be valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. In my opinion, the answer is clearly `Yes'. The High Court would regard the contrary argument as wholly misconceived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Clause 11 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"11. Subject to this Act, the common law of Australia in respect of native title has, after 30 June 1993, the force of a law of the Commonwealth."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. This provision, when read with clause 208(1) and other provisions of the Bill, would be a valid exercise of the power of the Commonwealth Parliament under section 51(xxvi) of the Constitution to make laws with respect to `the persons of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The effect of section 11 would be to give Commonwealth statutory force to the provisions of the common law of Australia in respect of native title. Section 11 would be a `law of the Commonwealth' within the meaning of section 109 of the Constitution, and therefore any State legislation inconsistent with the relevant common law rights would be invalid to the extent of the inconsistency. Issues as to the existence or content of native title in particular cases, in so far as native title would have Commonwealth statutory force, would be matters `arising under [a law] made by the Parliament `(ie. under section 11) within the meaning of section 76(ii) of the Constitution, and so federal jurisdiction could be validly conferred on the High Court and the Federal Court in such matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. I have been asked to comment specifically on suggestions that section 11 might be `void for uncertainty' on the ground that the common law is not set out anywhere in any `definitive verbal formulation'. It is true that it is not set out anywhere in definitive terms: it is `developed' by the courts (eg. Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 176 CLR 292, at 318-321). In the event of inconsistencies between the decisions of courts other than the High Court, the issues can ultimately be resolved in that court, though of course the High Court can overrule its own decisions. However, the fact that the common law may be uncertain is not a ground for saying that it cannot be given Commonwealth statutory force. After all, there has never been any doubt concerning the ability of the Parliament to `pick up' the provisions of State legislation even though those provisions may be vague and court decisions may vary and fluctuate concerning their correct interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The High Court has never expressed any doubts concerning previous instances of Commonwealth legislation `picking up' the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Examples include section 4 of the Crimes Act 1914 which provides that </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`the principles of the common law with respect to criminal liability shall, subject to this Act, apply in relation to offences against this Act.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, section 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903 provides as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`So far as the laws of the Commonwealth are not applicable or so far as their provisions are insufficient to carry them into effect, or to provide adequate remedies or punishment, the common law in Australia as modified by the Constitution and by the statute law in force in the State or Territory in which the Court in which the jurisdiction is exercised is held shall, so far as it is applicable and not inconsistent with the Constitution and the laws of the Commonwealth, govern all Courts exercising federal jurisdiction in the exercise of their jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. Other examples are section 103(1) of the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 and section 4 of the Marine Insurance Act 1909.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. Yet another example is section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903 which, from the earliest years of the century, has been understood as applying the common law (as well as statute law) to the Commonwealth (Baume v The Queen (1906) 4 CLR 97; also The Commonwealth v Evans Deakin Industries Ltd (1986) 161 CLR 254).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. A further example is found in the Commonwealth Places (Application of Laws) Act 1970 which applies in, and in relation to, `Commonwealth places' in a State the provisions of `the laws of [the] State', defined in section 3 to include `unwritten' law&mdash;ie. the common law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. Provisions such as these have been applied by the High Court without any suggestion that they are defective by reason of the `indeterminate' nature of the common law (see, for example, Pedersen v Young (1964) 110 CLR 162; Hooper v Hooper (1975) 91 CLR 529; also Lane, The Australian Federal System 2nd ed. 1976, at 691). I have no doubt that the High Court would take the same approach to the proposed section 11.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. I have been specifically asked to comment on the statement in Jackson v Gamble (1983) VR 552 at 559 by Young CJ that the expression `law of the Commonwealth' in section 109 is `not appropriate to describe a rule or principle of the common law'. With respect, that may well be so. But it clearly does not follow from that statement that, where a rule or principle of the common law is given the force of law by a Commonwealth Act, the latter is not a `law of the Commonwealth' within the meaning of section 109.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. If it were objected against clause 11 that it provides for the common law to have the `force of law' rather than providing that, for example, the rules of the common law `shall apply . . . . . . ' (cf. examples in paragraphs 8-12 above), the objection would entirely lack merit. The High Court is familiar with the concept of statutes giving the force of law to the provisions of an agreement&mdash;ie. of creating statutory rights and obligations over and above common law contractual obligations (eg. Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1, at 31, 89). Section 11 would be accorded an exactly similar effect in giving the force of law to the provisions of the common law in respect of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. For these reasons I conclude that constitutional objections to section 11 would be wholly misconceived.</PARA>

It has merit, in our judgment, in that it provides the same technical mechanism for revoking the recognition of a state or territory body as it does for the recognition of such a body.

<PARA>Amendment 33B to insert the new clause 196A seeks to ensure that Aboriginal people are not prevented from exercising their inherent native title rights and interests in circumstances where state and Commonwealth laws allow others to engage in those activities. The amendment does not prevent a state or the Commonwealth from prohibiting a native title activity where it is necessary, for example, for genuine conservation reasons, but it does prevent them from doing so while allowing others to engage in that same activity. In other words, the amendment prevents laws from having a discriminatory operation on Aboriginal people whose rights to conduct certain activities can sometimes be traced back many thousands of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause is particularly important for those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who may already be largely dispossessed and whose native title rights are limited to particular activities or resources. Without it there could be a creeping process of dispossession as native title rights are regulated out of existence, one by one, while other people remain free to carry out those same activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause is critical in protecting Aboriginal rights to hunt, fish and gather where the impact of the activity is not such as to require its non-discriminatory prohibition. The clause is limited in its operation to native title rights in relation to hunting, fishing, gathering or cultural or spiritual activities where those activities are for personal, domestic or communal purposes. Other types of activities can also be prescribed if the need arises. A similar protection of native title rights exists in Canada and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 34A is simply an effective confirmation under clause 197(2). It is basically to prevent the impairment of interest where native title rights may already be present in relation to land or waters. I cite a letter from Dr Dermot Smyth, honorary research fellow at James Cook University, who was a consultant to the Resource Assessment Commission's coastal zone inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am concerned that the bill as it now stands will not allow native title fishing rights to be exercised in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or Tasmania because laws in those states do not make any special provisions for Aboriginal fishing interests. In view of the current harassment, prosecution and occasional gaoling of Aboriginal fishers in southern states, it would be extremely unfortunate if the native title bill does not allow traditional fishing rights to coexist with statutory fishing laws.</PARA>
<PARA>It is really in response to that that the Greens present their two amendments. We also indicate that we are not willing to support government amendment No. 45. We have looked at the existing clause. We see that there is quite a clear confirmation of ownership of natural resources , access to beaches, et cetera, by the Crown. We believe that that is sufficient. We are therefore not prepared to change the wording from `fishing access' to `statutory fishing rights'. </PARA>

The idea of amendment 33B is not to immunise native titleholders completely from the operation of state laws of general application that bear upon hunting, fishing, gathering and things of that kind, such that they can do anything at all.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory prohibits or restricts persons from carrying on the class of activity other than in accordance with a licence, permit or other instrument granted or issued to them under the law;</PARA>
<PARA>Killing of endangered species is not the kind of activity which is permitted at all, whether by licence, permit or otherwise. The whole point of endangered species legislation around the country is to prohibit absolutely the activity in question. It is not to regulate it by prohibiting it absolutely except with a licence or a permit. Rather, it prohibits it absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the kind of threshold hurdle that has to be satisfied before this legislative provision bites is that the activity in question be the kind of activity which is permitted to at least some people provided they have a permit or licence. What the clause does for Aboriginal people is enable them to engage in the activity in question without that permit or licence, provided that they have got a native title umbrella under which to exercise the right in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were ways of spelling that out more directly. This is a bit indirect; it does need to be explained to be understood, but it is there. The way the clause is constructed, it is intended to be sensitive to that particular concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say further about this whole business of exemptions from state laws of general application, as we discussed at a very early stage of this committee debate, a lot of things are going to have to be subject to review in terms of the way in which particular state laws operate, whether they are gun laws, licensing laws or things of that kind, just to get a slightly greater degree of clarity perhaps into a number of the areas in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Chamarette might have mentioned the particular example of south coast New South Wales Aboriginal people who have traditionally engaged in abalone gathering or abalone fishing. There have been difficulties in the context of being prosecuted because there is an absolute prohibition on that activity unless it is done by way of licence by commercial fishermen. What this does is not confer an absolute open slather right to engage in abalone fishing. It confers, however, a right to do so by Aboriginal people who have a native title&mdash;and, of course, they have to establish that before they will be completely immunised from prosecution and so on under this clause. They have a right to carry on that activity where they do so&mdash;this is in subclause (2)(a) and (b)&mdash;for the purpose of satisfying their personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs and they are doing it in the exercise or enjoyment of their native title rights and interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this means is that individuals or small family groups or small community groups can engage in this activity provided it does not have any commercial character about it and provided it is carried on under the umbrella of the native title right, and can do so with immunity from the operation of the general law. But acknowledge and recognise again that this only applies in situations where the activity is not absolutely prohibited but is allowed to be carried on by some people, provided they have a permit or licence, whether it is for commercial purposes or otherwise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no specific reference to bag limits, but there is a reference, which I have read out to Senator Panizza, which limits it to `satisfying their personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs'. What that will mean, in terms of the amount of the particular game, fish or whatever is taken, will obviously depend on the particular circumstance. But they are reasonably easily ascertainable limits and the sort of thing that courts, tribunals and so on are used to dealing with and applying. It is just on the balance of reasonable knowledge about how much is fair enough in terms of satisfying that sort of criteria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, one would not have to engage in the same sorts of start-up costs that are involved for professional abalone fishing ventures. Normally a fishing operation of a certain kind&mdash;abalone is a very good example&mdash;can be done only on a commercial and licensed basis where everybody else is prohibited and if one is going to do it at all, one has to have a big start-up fee at the threshold to get into the game and so on. The whole point of this is to say that, notwithstanding all those normal restrictions, native titleholders can bypass them, provided that&mdash;and the proviso is very important&mdash;it is on a very small, intimate and personal scale and they are doing it pursuant to a genuinely held native title right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just any Aboriginal people who can henceforth descend upon the abalone fishing waters and go for their life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not the exemption that is set out here would extend to an exemption from obtaining the permit for the firearm in question is, I think, extremely doubtful.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as fishing is concerned, I will make a general point. I think we will be in a bit of trouble with amendment 45 to clause 197 unless the opposition has a bit of a think about supporting this. The Greens have indicated opposition to it and we cannot carry it without the opposition's support. This is a very explicit industry provision. It is another one of a kind. Those opposite have already knocked three of them off by taking the stance that they have in relation to this legislation. I draw their attention to our amendment No. 45, which is intended to clarify the existing 197(1)(c). It presently reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . existing fishing access rights&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which would include both public and private rights&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">prevail over any other public or private rights.</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment makes it clear that it is statutory fishing rights&mdash;not existing fishing access rights&mdash;which prevail over any other fishing rights. In other words, this clarifies that states and territories may act to confirm that statutory fishing rights prevail over any other kind of fishing rights, and that includes any native title rights that may exist. I think that is a pretty important principle from the point of view of the fishing industry and the certainty that it wants to inject. That would not cut across the debate we have just been having about our proposed new clause 196(a), because in that context there is a specific exemption provided for certain kinds of fishing activities in certain circumstances, as with other kinds of hunting activities. This is clearly a protective provision designed to clarify the law and to assist the industry to give it a degree of certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It looks as though this provision will go down unless there is a willingness to support it on the opposition side. I know Senator Panizza has a close and intense interest in the fishing industry, which he demonstrated again in the contribution he has just made. Maybe as a last dying gesture on the bill, he would contemplate coming across and bringing a couple of his mates with him in order to make a hero of himself with the fishing industry in WA. If he does not, I guess this is another particular matter which we will need to look at in the new year as part of some reviewing legislation. But I do make that invitation. The opposition has already scored three ducks in terms of major industry clauses which it has been asked to support; this is a chance to avoid the fourth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concept of the land fund is one of the central elements in the policy which lies behind the government's response here. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made that very clear in his second reading speech, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step, we are establishing a land fund. It will enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way in order to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of other statements have spelt that out in much more detail. I wish to make two points. First, there is no need in embarking on a policy initiative of this kind and putting it into practice to create a legislative framework for it at all. We could do it as a matter of straightforward executive government program expenditure. There would need to be an appropriation provision in the annual budget or provided for in some other way to authorise the appropriation of money for the expenditure purpose in question. But we do not need any formal legislative authorisation for this kind of expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The framework here is just that&mdash;very skeletal in character and not spelling out the detail of it in terms of criteria and everything else. It is a reflection not only of the fact that these things have not been fully worked through yet and that we have to go through a more substantial consultative process, but also the reflection of the fact that there is no need for this sort of stuff to be in the legislation at all. We wanted to put it in the bill to make clear our commitment to this important part of the total strategy, just as the social justice package aspect of it is equally an important part of the strategy, although one is less amenable to legislative reference at all. That is the broad point I want to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more specific and second point I want to make is in relation to these regulations that will need to be quite detailed to fill this out in a much more substantial way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to refer to the two amendments proposed by the Greens. I wonder whether Senator Chamarette is interested in this debate; I notice she is in a special huddle at the back of the chamber. I am interested in pursuing a couple of comments with regard to her amendments that relate to inserting new clause 196A and also a substituted clause 197(3). I think the minister has indicated he is inclined to support these amendments. Therefore, it is important to get both a Green and a Labor response to these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New clause 196A says that if a law of a state or territory prohibits or restricts a person with native title rights from hunting and fishing, except in accordance with a licence or a permit, then that law will be ineffective where the native titleholders are hunting, fishing, et cetera, for their own personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some examples of this operation would be to preserve the numbers of a particular species of fish. A law of a state prohibits the catching of that species except to the holders of a limited number of licences. If there are people with native title rights in respect of these areas, they will be immune from this law and will be able to fish the species at will for communal needs. This is clearly undesirable. I would have thought that the Greens, from their environmental perspective, would have been very concerned about that form of control. This is the sort of activity that governments&mdash;necessarily state and territory governments&mdash;should be able to control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions that I would pose about this proposed amendment are as follows. Is it intended to apply only to native title land and waters, or will its application be wider? For instance, does it extend to pastoral leases, other leases and freehold land? Probably from the minister's point of view with regard to this amendment, I would ask very plainly: is it within the constitutional power of the Commonwealth?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the amendment is only confined to native title areas&mdash;land and waters. For many years the Green movement has firmly believed that the care with which Australia was looked after for 40,000 years and the degree of environmental damage that the past 200 years has imposed on it clearly demonstrates that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had the best interests and the stewardship of the land at heart and did a much better job than unfortunately we have been able to do. We therefore have no concerns regarding how they are likely to deal with land and waters that are under their native title claims. We understand that this amendment is actually in place simply to ensure that they are not discriminated against when we are allowing licences to be issued in the lands where they have traditionally hunted, fished and gathered their food and been part of their own cultural activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a failure to pass this amendment as a discriminatory activity. We see an inclusion of it as a simple recognition of the fact that Aboriginal people have a spiritual and profound connection with the land and a profound respect as to the way in which they deal with it in regard to any animals or vegetation that might be connected with that land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second part of my question related to the constitutionality of this issue. Senator Chamarette expresses a very naive belief in the faith of Aboriginal culture. While I am not in any way intending to put Aboriginal culture or tradition down, I would point out that many of the claimants for such purposes of native title today are not the Aborigines of 200 or 300 years ago with established custom and tradition. Many of them today need and require the protection of the various state controls and regulations, whether they be environmental or anything else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My second issue arises out of clause 197, which reflects on the capacity of states and territories to confirm ownership and control of certain resources where they are said to be subject to the provisions of this bill. The minister acknowledged earlier that there were some very serious complications with the present clause that obviously will have to be addressed by the government in future. The minister has already acknowledged that he has discovered some points; I think it was in clause (3) or something like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to his attention the expression in subclause 197(1)&mdash;`subject to this act'. Because those words appear, the confirmation by the government of the ownership of minerals, the control of waters and fishing rights may now need to go through the future acts regime in the bill and compensation may be payable. If these matters are not addressed and clear, there will be an endless loop of litigation along with the resulting costs and delays that will arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have addressed clause 197 with its amendment 34A, which the government has indicated it is inclined to support. It substitutes subclause 197(3). The existing subclause 197(1) allows states and territories to confirm the right of ownership of natural resources. Subclause 197(2) allows confirmation of public access to and enjoyment of things like beaches and the banks of rivers. The present subclause 197(3) says that subclause 197(2) does not extinguish any native title rights or affect any land that has already been granted to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed clause 197(3) is said to apply to both 197(1) and 197(2) and not just 197(2), as is currently in the bill, and extends not just to extinguishment but is also said to prevent any impairment of native title rights and interests. It may be that state and territory laws confirming existing ownership of resources, control of waters or existing statutory fishing rights may impair native title rights. The Greens' amendment sets up internal inconsistencies between these subclauses. This will be fertile ground for these legal disputes. I therefore ask the minister, seeing he is inclined to accept this amendment: will the law confirming the crown control of waters prevail or will it be struck down because it impairs some native title interests?  The amendment changes the whole meaning and purpose of clause 197 and should be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was all a bit of a fly in and flourish from Senator Tambling, but I do not think it is justified by the material in front of him. The Greens' amendment number 34A which seeks to introduce a new subclause (3) to clause 197 is supported by the government because we believe that it represents a careful balancing of the rights of native titleholders and those in the wider community as may be asserted by states and territories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision in issue here is one that is simply intended to clarify that the mere confirmation of existing statutory provisions will not, of itself, extinguish or impair native title. That is not at odds with the other subclauses here. It does not fight against them in any way. It does not confuse or complicate them. It is simply an additional clarifying provision which we believe is justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Senator Tambling's point about other aspects of clause 197, in particular 197(1), Senator Tambling made reference to the phrase `subject to this act'. Sometimes I think that does appear as a bit of legislative draftsman's twitch. It is not always justified; it does not always have any really substantive content. Here I think the clear intention, however, is to say that while the law of the Commonwealth, state or territory may confirm these various things, it cannot go further in so confirming those rights than this act allows. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the real need for amendment of clause 197 is in relation to the particular provision that I mentioned, and that is the government's own amendment to that clause, amendment 45, which would have the effect of making rather clearer than is the case at the moment that statutory fishing rights prevail over any others, subject to the act. That means in this instance subject, for example, to 196A. But that particular provision, as I said a few minutes ago to Senator Panizza, is one that I know the industry would very much welcome and Senator Tambling will have his chance to assist in this respect by supporting this particular amendment&mdash;and I hope he contemplates doing so, even though it would be breaking a duck in terms of his approach to this legislation. </PARA>

I am concerned, bearing in mind the reasons for the Greens being here and their considerable concern about the environment and endangered species, that amongst those activities there is or has been known to be the use of the deliberate lighting of fires. I am wondering just where this is covered and what would be the situation if fires were to be deliberately lit where there is a prohibition on the lighting of fires.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferguson for his question. The environment movement has been very clear in its stance on these practices&mdash;and that includes all the environmental practices of Aboriginal people&mdash;and that is that the beneficial aspects of those practices far outweigh any negative effects. Certainly they far outweigh the negative impacts of our own practices. In Western Australia the Department of Conservation and Land Management actually uses the burning techniques that it ascribes to Aboriginal people. Those techniques actually arouse considerable concern every season as more and more of our old growth forests are burnt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have any evidence that suggests that the practices of Aboriginal people on their own native title land will be in any way a problem. I must add that, in this specific amendment, all we are doing is looking at removing a discriminatory feature of state law. The particular emphasis is on fishing and sea rights. I remind the committee that this amendment is in response to a consultant's report by a person who actually made a submission to the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That person included an extract from the final report of the Resource Assessment Commission's coastal zone inquiry and also a copy of his final consultant's report to that inquiry. From this leading environmentalist we have quite clearly an understanding that it is in Australia's interests to give recognition to indigenous people and the kinds of environmental practices that they have managed to preserve over hundreds of years in an ecologically sustainable way. We have a lot to emulate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I make a small supplementary contribution? In the case of bush fire control situations, there is no doubt that on a day of absolute fire ban there would be an absolute prohibition, not allowing anyone to light a fire for any purpose, whatever the quality of the track record and the traditional management of the particular area in question. That applies notwithstanding whatever permits for burning off particular classes of non-Aboriginal people might be able to obtain. If there is an absolute provision, as is the case on an absolute fire ban day, as there is for a good deal of the summer months in critical tinder areas of the country, there would be no grounds for an exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to make is that the kind of burning off case that people have in mind here would have to be carried out in order to satisfy the terms of this particular clause in the exercise or enjoyment of their native title rights and interests. Not just any Aboriginal person in any context whatsoever could wander around lighting up stretches of the bush and claiming that there was some justification for that. It would have to be very carefully and clearly associated with a native title interest. If there are any geographical boundaries to that interest, as one would normally expect there to be, then one would expect the practice to be confined in that way. If it were done in a way such as to put at risk neighbouring properties or things of that kind, then again there would be ample grounds for controlling the activity and not regarding it as exempt in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is one aspect of it. As with a lot of these things that are subject to exemptions from state laws, it does need further review and monitoring. We have said that from day one. But this is a complex area. The intention here was simply to map out, in a way that did seem capable of at least being crafted in the context of this legislation, one set of exemptions but to take on notice some of larger problems that are associated with this area and perhaps revisit this over the course of the next year or so. That would also involve monitoring the potential application of some of these existing provisions that are in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for that contribution. I think it is easy to talk about total fire ban and prohibition days from metropolitan Melbourne or, in Senator Chamarette's case, from metropolitan Perth. However, there are vast tracts of Australia where fires are prohibited for periods of up to six months. There is total fire prohibition. It is not just a fire ban day; there is a total prohibition. That is six months of the year when we cannot light any fire of any description.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would make is that, if there is special consideration given to native titleholders with regard to the lighting of fires, Senator Chamarette needs to be reminded that, when fires are lit, they do not always stop at the boundary of a native title. I have known fires to burn through fences and then to burn on to destroy cattle on privately owned cattle stations and pastoral leases. So, if these sorts of activities are to be allowed to occur at all under the protection of native title, it puts at risk people who are not protected under native title and who have no other comeback. </PARA>

The area where there is a concern&mdash;which is the justification for this amendment&mdash;is the one which Senator Panizza mentioned earlier.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such co-existence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is in the north&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would not, in my view, result in any significant dislocation of Australia's commercial or recreational fisheries&mdash;across northern Australia indigenous people are already exempt from most fisheries laws and regulations. It would, however, permit those Aboriginal people in southern Australia who wish to continue their traditional practices to do so . . . It may also encourage fisheries managers to actively seek the involvement of Aboriginal fishers in the management of Australia's fisheries.</PARA>

I will put it this way: with the really endangered species, those where every single example, every individual element of animal, bird or fish in the species is at risk, there is an absolute prohibition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Then I think one is faced with the situation of just acknowledging that the kind of quantum that would be involved in Aboriginal native titleholders taking that species would not be such as to contribute a major problem. If there were an open-ended exemption for Aboriginal native titleholders, simply because they were Aboriginal native titleholders, to take commercial quantities of the species in question, maybe the alarm bells would properly jangle. Under those circumstances, one would say, `Hang on; that is going too far'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the limits that are in the bill satisfying personal, domestic or non-commercial communal needs I genuinely believe set a stringent enough criterion not to be a problem for what Senator Ferguson describes as species in some danger, rather than endangered species. We could not have a criterion as loose as that with species that were genuinely totally endangered and in respect of which there was a total prohibition elsewhere. That would be too loose a criterion, but for other sorts of species like ducks and so on where there are bag limits, then one would see this as a reasonable way through the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address some brief remarks to the government's amendment to clause 197(1)(c). It would seem to me from having read the fishing industry's careful submissions to the Senate standing committee's review of this bill that the amendment does not go at all to addressing the fishing industry's very fundamental concerns about this whole bill. This bill is another example of this government's complete disregard for the industries that actually create jobs and wealth in this country. Its feel-good policy has led it to completely disregard the effects of this bill on the creation of wealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry, in its submissions, made it quite clear that it had absolutely no consultation whatsoever over this bill. It is terribly worried about the complexity. It makes the point that the bill fails to validate its fishing licences at all. It is no good allowing a state to confirm that fishing rights prevail if those fishing rights are not indeed valid. There is absolutely no guarantee of that. There is no guarantee that the states will even act to confirm, so the industry is left with nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the problem, as the industry identified, that fishing permits do not extinguish native title as a co-existence. There is no satisfaction in relation to the potential for compensation of holders of fishing licences. There are huge problems for the industry in this bill, and merely to change the words `fishing access' to `statutory fishing' goes no way to solving the problems that the industry quite clearly identified when it put its submissions to the standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just ask the minister in relation to the amendment: do the words `fishing access' not contemplate the coverage of statutory fishing? How does the change of those words actually improve the position for the industry at all? We have problems of what are statutory fishing rights. Are they only commercial? Are they recreational? How does the description `statutory fishing' really differ from the expression `fishing access'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said earlier, fishing access rights would include public and private rights of a non-statutory character basically other than commercial type rights that are specifically provided for in a commercial regime. The utility of this provision from the industry viewpoint is, as I said, that it confirms that statutory fishing rights do prevail over any other fishing rights&mdash;anything at all, including native title rights&mdash;but it is subject to the legislation. So the clause 196A provision we have just been talking about would be a partial exemption to that, but the only one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not the only provision that we put in here in response to worries by the fishing industry about the terms of the original bill. The onshore rights provisions of which there is a whole gaggle of amendments&mdash;namely, our amendments to clauses 16, 22, 220, 225 and 238; all of them address this question of the definition of onshore waters&mdash;was our response to one of the most vigorously expressed concerns of the Australian fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind those opposite again, although it is obviously embarrassing for me to do so, that the failure of those opposite to come across and support us in our amendment No. 74, which was designed to address the question of the definition of fishing rights in the intertidal zone area, is something that does impact adversely on the abalone, pearl and barramundi industries and is a source of real concern to those industries. So we did our best to clarify the status of onshore rights. We have done that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did our best to clarify the status, in particular, of intertidal waters. We have not been able to do that because those opposite did not support our amendment. We are going to try now to add this extra provision that is sought by the industry, and legitimately so, to clarify the priority of statutory rights in this particular industry. It is up to those opposite now as to whether they support us in doing that, but do not indicate that we have been less than sensitive to the concerns of the fishing industry. We have been very sensitive indeed and have tried to respond accordingly. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps. That is quite possible. It is because the essential concept of the land fund is not just in the context of native title and responding further to the needs or requests of native titleholders for property purchases. Part of the object of the whole land fund notion is to get some equity into the equation as between those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who can still credibly claim native title and regain access to the land in that way and those Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed and lost all of the kind of contact with the land that could begin to justify that title status.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I will explain this amendment briefly because it has not been the subject of a separate explanatory memorandum. The clause in question, clause 238, defines various legislation as coming within the term `Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander land or waters'. Paragraph (c) of this amendment allows laws to be prescribed for the purpose of validations but not necessarily for the purpose of the future regime. This will allow decisions to be taken in the future on whether land rights laws or this bill will regulate future actions over statutorily granted Aboriginal lands. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, there is a separately circulated amendment under this category numbered 50A, which again I will explain because it is not in the explanatory memorandum. The amendment seeks to insert a new subclause 208(4). Its effect might be described as follows: under 208(3) the definition of native title includes native title rights and interests compulsorily converted into statutory rights. This amendment provides that rights and interests created by reservations or conditions in pastoral leases, whether in the lease or by virtue of the legislation under which the lease was granted, are not converted into native title by subclause (3). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because these rights and interests are created by statute, they cannot be native title under subclause 208(1). This provision makes clear that 208(3) does not result in these rights being treated as native title by the bill. If under the common law, native title survives the grant of the pastoral lease, it will fall within the definition of native title in subclause 208(1). But the determination of this issue is left for the common law. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 208, page 95, at the end of the clause add the following subclause:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Case not covered by subsection (3)</PARA>

<PARA>The next amendment is amendment No. 51 to clause 211. This amendment, which is on the main sheet and in the explanatory memorandum, goes to the definition of `acts'. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(51)Clause 211, page 97, lines 4 to 6, omit subclause (4).</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, there are a series of what can only be described as miscellaneous definitions. There are amendments to clauses 212, 214 and 238. The amendments in question are amendments Nos 52, 54, 55, 57, 70 and 73. Again, they are explained in the explanatory memorandum. I move:</PARA>

The total duration of the debate is nearly 46 hours, given that we spent 10 hours and 20 minutes on the second reading debate. Given that, in the course of that 35 1/2 hours of committee stage debate, a huge amount of the discussion has ranged backwards and forwards over these definitional provisions for the obvious reason that many of the earlier substantive clauses can only be understood in the light of those definitions, I do not think anyone need fuss unduly that he or she is missing out on a quality debate on these issues in the maximum three hours that remain. </PARA>

<PARA>The Australian Democrats have moved essentially three batches of amendments. The first batch contains amendments Nos 38 and 39, together with amendment No. 46, which is consequential on amendment Nos 38 and 39 being passed. These amendments deal with commercial leases, particularly in the area of tourist developments. They seek to ensure that native title is extinguished only on that portion of the lease on which there is a substantial development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 53 amends clause 220 and deals with the renewals, regrants or extensions of certain leases. This amendment was made necessary because government amendment No. 14, relating to clause 24, was not agreed to. According to our legal opinion, when a valid lease was nearing the end of its term and native title had been extinguished by that valid lease that native title could be revived between the time of the old lease coming to a conclusion and the new grant being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of the provisions of the government's amendment, according to our legal advice,  made it impossible legally to grant the new lease. It was therefore thought imperative to rectify this situation. Democrat amendment No. 53 has been arrived at to cure that possible danger. The amendment includes in the `permissible future act' the renewals, re-grants and extensions of commercial, agricultural, pastoral or residential leases. This is provided the granting of the lease does not create a proprietary interest where previously the interest had been a non-proprietary one and provided that it does not create a larger proprietary interest than was previously created by the lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the amendment ensures that where the lease contains a reservation or condition for the benefit of Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders, the renewed, re-granted or extended lease contains the same reservation or condition. This would probably have been the case anyway but the inclusion of that clause, which I am glad to say I took a personal interest in, makes sure of that. I believe that this amendment is important. I commend it to the coalition parties and in particular to those National Party senators who crossed the floor last time. This amendment satisfies a number of interests including those of the Aboriginal people and native titleholders concerned, as well as those of the pastoral industry. </PARA>

Amendment 38 ensures that Aboriginal people are not precluded from showing sufficient connection to the land even though they may not have been able to maintain continuous, physical presence on the land.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a point that the minister made shortly before all the amendments were moved, and that is in relation to the time allowed for each section of the debate. Yesterday&mdash;I am losing track of time as well&mdash;the minister said in relation to the definitions that we should not need to spend very much time debating it when we got to it. He repeated that just before the dinner break and made the point that we had spent a lot of time discussing definitions on the way through in the detailed discussion of the clauses. Yet the minister, whom we understand wrote up the breaking up of times for the various sets of clauses&mdash;the guillotine, as it is called&mdash;allowed three hours for this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to have on the record that the opposition does understand why this took place. It was so that the minister could say in front of a packed press gallery that he was allowing another roughly seven hours for the debate when the crucial, most contentious and detailed clauses in terms of the practical administration, operation and constitutionality of this bill were contained in the clauses up to 206, which were guillotined after a few hours. Through what is effectively a sleight of hand, he has allowed three hours debate on what he has already told the chamber of his own free will is basically a set of definitions which he says we should not need to spend anything like three hours on. So it is important that the chamber understands that the minister, in what he calls his generous guillotine, has allowed three hours for the definitions which should not, in his own words, require as much contribution as those other clauses. In relation to the last two packages, I know there were a number of opposition speakers who were not able to contribute to the debate due to the falling of the guillotine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the minister to clause 208(3), which deals with the definition of native title and statutory rights and interests. In a previous discussion involving clause 11 and the question of common law native title being treated as laws of the Commonwealth, Senator Alston raised the issue of the Western Australian conversion of native title rights into statutory rights as an example of the application of 208(3). He was suggesting that judicial decisions in relation to actions involving statutory rights in Western Australia could then become part of native title common law. The minister dismissed the suggestion that those Western Australian statutory rights could possibly be considered native title within the definition as set out in 208(3). The Parliamentary Library has advised officially all parliamentarians in relation to this section as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of `native title' in proposed section 208 provides that, if native title rights and interests have been compulsorily converted into, or replaced by, statutory rights and interests, then those statutory rights and interests are also covered by the expression `native title'. This means, for example, that even though the Western Australian Land (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act 1993 has extinguished native title and replaced it with statutory rights of traditional usage, then these rights of traditional usage will be given the same protection as native title under the Native Title Bill. Reference to `native title' in the following discussion should therefore be taken to include any statutory rights to which native title has been compulsory converted.</PARA>
<PARA>So the legal department of the Parliamentary Library certainly took the same view that we did; that is, clause 208(3) does cover the native title statutory rights and interests created in Western Australia with all the implications that follow from that interpretation. There is clearly a great deal of confusion about what that means. I wonder whether the minister could enlighten us on exactly why there will not be confusion when this bill becomes law. Why is the Parliamentary Library so wrong? Why are we wrong? Is there something that we have not seen in relation to this matter?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not entirely sure what the Parliamentary Library said in relation to clause 208(3) as I was receiving some advice when Senator Minchin referred to that. Basically, clause 208(3) clearly deals with the situation that has arisen in Western Australia where there has been a purported overturning of the common law native rights that existed in order to create a new statutory regime with less rights in practice attached to the statutory native title rights under the Western Australian legislation than would have been available to common law native rights holders. In particular, there are all sorts of provisions for the effective diminution or, ultimately, termination of those rights by ministerial discretion and so on. There is none of the panoply of protections, procedures and institutional opportunities available for common law native titleholders under the Commonwealth legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that that is the effect of the Western Australian legislation. In effect, clause 208(3) gives a re-birth to those Western Australian native title rights&mdash;or any similar native title rights that have been overridden&mdash;and creates those rights in a statutory form with exactly the same status as common law native rights. So they have been recreated and re-born as a result of the effect of this statutory provision overriding the Western Australian provision as, again, the equivalent of full scale common law native title rights. All the opportunities, all the processes and all the rights associated with those common law rights are effectively secured as a result of this particular subclause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of completion, I wish to add a supplementary remark to what I said earlier to Senator Minchin. This is, in a sense, a kind of belt and braces provision. Our working presumption is that the legislative effect of this particular bill when passed and enacted, noting its operative dates and so on, will be to overturn the Western Australian legislation and create a result that were as if that legislation had never been enacted&mdash;in other words, as if the common law native title rights in WA had never been extinguished by statute; quite apart from what happens to them thereafter. If we are wrong about that&mdash;and if, for whatever reason, the courts hold that our law is incapable of having the retrospective effect of denying the initial validity of the Western Australian legislation&mdash;then, as I said before, the effect of clause 208(3) will be to recreate in essence those Western Australian former common law rights which, on that hypothesis, would have been regarded as being extinguished by the Western Australian statute and secure their recreation as a kind of native title equivalent right given that status by virtue of the Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very complicated jurisprudential stuff; I am very conscious of that. As I understand it, that is the way these clauses are intended to operate&mdash;maybe with some further qualification which I had better find out about.

Just as we, for the purposes of clause 11, pick up the common law and give it statutory force, in essence in clause 208(3) we are picking up the Western Australian statute and giving it the force of common law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just as land includes water, under the bill, in some contexts, not all, so potentially it includes air-space. What follows from that in terms of whether this is regarded as an interference in native title depends entirely on the extent to which native title is determined to include some air space component. Our reference to up to the heavens and down to the centre of the earth was a reference to prevailing common law rules about ownership. It is not to be assumed that common law rules in other contexts will be applicable to findings about native title; that has got to be worked out. I am not sure of the context in which it would ever become relevant to sort it out and whether the tribunals would be terribly minded to get stuck into the details of undertaking this particular conundrum. But it is not to be assumed, simply because such and such is the rule as a matter of common law, that that rule will be applicable to native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think we should make any assumptions that there is any air-space component to native title.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Coming through this legislation is almost a hatred, or a vindictiveness, in relation to Western Australia. Senator Evans's response to Mabo might well be appropriate for what has happened on the eastern seaboard. I am not saying that what has happened in Western Australia is perfect, and I do not want to convey that impression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened in Western Australia is far superior to what has happened in the other states; although South Australia and the Northern Territory have gone some way towards the Western Australian situation. Maybe I am out of order in not strictly debating this legislation, but I think it important that some facts be placed on the public record. In the state of Western Australia there has been a reservation for indigenous people for some 100 years. The reservation has been provided for in legislation since 1934, and prior to that it was a condition of lease. As imperfect as that may have been, it is one hell of a lot more than has happened in  Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and in particular Tasmania. It amazes me that people stand up in this place and pontificate on how moral and wonderful they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, it is important to place on the public record that in the mid-1980s&mdash;and I am very proud to have been associated with this initiative&mdash;Western Australia put in place the process of the purchasing of stations. Obviously last night the minister was not aware of this and nor were his advisers. In responding to me the minister said that those stations were very limited when, in fact, they cover approximately 10 per cent of our pastoral leases and form an ongoing program. I have to say, from first-hand knowledge and experience, that the way in which those stations are now being run is very little different from the way other stations are being run. Some stations are very good, some are of a middling standard and some are not so good. But in my view the whole process in Western Australia has worked extremely well. Also, in Western Australia excision legislation was put in place. As imperfect as it might be, once again it is one hell of a lot better than the situation on the eastern seaboard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Western Australian I feel I should put these points on the public record. We can look at a whole range of matters. The Greens want the eastern states response to Mabo, plus whatever they can pick out of the eyes of the legislation that has been put in place. I will not stand here and say that the Western Australian government has it totally right. But what I do say is that, in my view, the response of the Western Australian government in relation to the things I have spoken about is much more appropriate than the response we are getting in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, and indeed have known for a long time, many elders in Western Australia. I have been consistently told by them that they prefer the Western Australian response to the federal government's response. Yet we see that so much of the federal government's response&mdash;and, unfortunately, this has come through consistently in this debate&mdash;is targeted at Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that respect, I sincerely believe that the federal government has taken its eye off the ball, which I think is very unfortunate.

The Greens and the Democrats can throw all the barbs they like at us for not moving any amendments to the legislation. Our job in opposition is to scrutinise legislation. We have absolutely, totally and clearly demonstrated that there are so many difficulties and holes in this legislation that we will be back here within six months, probably three months, with a whole raft of additional amendments. I am not sure how many amendments have now been made to the legislation but it must be getting close to 300.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond immediately to Senator Crane to say a couple of things for the record about this. I do not doubt for a moment Senator Crane's sincerity on this particular issue. He has made a contribution to this debate, which has on occasion been robust and on occasion emotional but, by and large, it has been constructive. It has been a contribution that has been based on concern about the way in which the legislation would operate rather than just mindless opposition to it. I acknowledge that and I respect that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government's response, equally, should not be construed as mindless opposition to anything that comes out of the west or ignorance about or indifference to the views that prevail in the west. On the contrary, we have sought throughout the course of this saga to discuss, to consult, to negotiate, and we have been disappointed by the unwillingness of that process to bear fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If what we are doing in this legislation is in some respects directed at state legislation like that passed in Western Australia, or which might conceivably at some stage in the future be passed elsewhere, it is really for a very good set of reasons which were very well captured in what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said in his second reading speech introducing this bill and which I picked up and applied in the language of my response to the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are concerned about with the Western Australian legislation&mdash;or any other legislation that might be like it in the future&mdash;are really three things: first, the compulsory wholesale extinguishment of native title as embodied in the common law and with it the inherent right, not the granted right, of Aboriginals and Torres Straight Islanders who meet the criteria of the common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern is the mandatory replacement of this by a form of statutory title. The fact that it is replaced with something is obviously better than nothing. But the replacement of it by statutory title which is only conferred at the pleasure of government and which can, under the structure of that legislation, be extinguished in particular cases virtually at a minister's whim is of concern. None of the kinds of procedures are provided that we are providing for in this legislation that we think are inherent in the common law right if properly protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, in the Western Australian legislation there is a detailed land management regime which provides only, as we see it, as we characterise it and as we judge it, the flimsiest of protections for Aboriginal people&mdash;protections which are far less than other land-holders enjoy in the way in which they can be overridden by miscellaneous grants or other competing interests. That is the problem with the Western Australian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should be regarded as a recognition as of right has turned into, by a stroke of the legislative pen, an act of parliamentary, governmental, charity. Aboriginal rights are what the parliament, the government, is prepared to concede they are at any given point of time. They are not something inherent, not something which flow out of the dignity, the culture, the background or the history of Aboriginal people which has been ignored, overlooked, suppressed or destroyed for so long. They are something granted in a rather grudging and limited way by a parliament that is basically so concerned about other competing interests that it is not prepared to take the risks of giving those rights to their fullest possible extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we are concerned about with the Western Australian legislation. It is not because it comes out of the west, not because we do not understand that Western Australia is where most of the real action on the ground is and not because we are obsessed with eastern states' models which have no real application most of the time in most contexts to the real world situation that applies there. We do understand that. But what we have difficulty in understanding&mdash;what we certainly have difficulty in accepting&mdash;is that there is any legitimacy about that kind of statutory process which cuts that degree of a swathe through the Aboriginal rights which, for the first time in over 200 years, have actually been recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we are about in this legislation. That is why we want to get this right. I think we have got it right. I think the demonstration over the last 36 hours now of committee debate here has got this bill looking a lot better in terms of its integrity, its cohesion and its specific language clause by clause than opposition senators probably thought it was. Maybe it is even better than I thought it was when I got up to start defending it because I think it stands up pretty well to detailed scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legislation of this complexity, of this length, prepared in this way, in this kind of process, is bound to show up some flaws. Some of those flaws have been identified. We sought to correct them, but we could not because of the politics of this place at this time. We will need to go back to them at an early stage to have another look at them. Other flaws are bound to show up in the course of the monitoring and the implementation of this legislation. That is the way it works out over time. That is inherent in the nature of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want us all in the future to approach this legislation in a much more constructive spirit&mdash;as a given, as a here and now reality in Australian legislative life. Let us not get back to the kind of attitude that for so long we have had in relation to Aboriginal land rights legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got into the Aboriginal land rights game back in 1973 when I was working as an adviser&mdash;a fresh-faced young lawyer-academic&mdash;to Gordon Bryant with the Kulaluk people in the Northern Territory, in Darwin, starting the Aboriginal legal services. That is when I first became aware of this as a burning issue for Aboriginal people. I have been concerned with it on and off in a personal and ministerial career ever since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of those people who had the most acute sense of disappointment, of despair almost, at our failure to be able to implement a national land rights policy back in 1984-85. It was a worthy aspiration, but it failed. I felt an enormous sense of disappointment, almost betrayal of the Aboriginal people, that we failed to get it right then to capture the majority of the constituency to get a legislative package through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court, almost out of a clear, blue sky, has done the job for us in Mabo. It has broken through that barrier of indifference, those barriers imposed by a multitude of other competing interests drowning out the still small voice of the Aboriginal people, what is left of them. Mabo has given us a chance, an historic opportunity, to get it right. Maybe this legislation is not perfect but it gets it more right than any previous attempt. That is why we have fought this issue so passionately, so hard, for so long, not just because it is another legislative exercise, not just because it is another political battle, but because it has real historic significance. That is why we fought the Western Australian model because we think it diminishes, it does not dignify, the rights that we are trying to protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we think we have achieved with this piece of legislation is quite possibly the most important piece of social justice this country has ever seen. What we think we have achieved in this legislation is some degree of decency and respect embodied in the legislation for Aboriginal people. That is why we are fighting this issue the way we are. It is not for some mean-spirited, throwaway, transient political reason; it is because we think the cause is just and worth fighting in this way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think anyone on the opposition's side would doubt the sincerity of the minister's views or indeed those of many of the ministers in the Keating cabinet who feel so passionately about implementing national land rights as the government is seeking to achieve through this legislation. Equally, I think the minister would recognise, whether or not he likes it, that people on our side of the chamber, even though we respect the deeply held views of the minister and some of his colleagues, think that the way the government has gone about it is wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us think that we can look after Aboriginal rights; we can make sure that they are protected; and we can ensure that the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people can be delivered in a very different way. The consensus that broke down during the 1980s, particularly because of the political expediency of the then Premier Brian Burke&mdash;which I am sure I do not need to remind the minister about&mdash;reflected the strong community opinion that a national land rights scheme was not the right way to approach the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess all of the constitutional issues that are involved in trying to develop a national land rights scheme, as this bill does, will sooner or later be fought out in the courts. Again, those legal battles will do very little for the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people. There is no doubt that this legislation will be subject to High Court action. The Richard Court WA legislation is already subject to action. Those actions are only a product of governments going well beyond their constitutional powers, creating far too much power in Canberra, going through an undemocratic process, creating what we describe on this side of the chamber as a divisive piece of legislation which is separatist in our view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that we have heard many arguments as to why it is not separatist, but I think it is a great shame that where a government goes well beyond its constitutional powers&mdash;or at least tries to stretch the use of those constitutional powers to the absolute limit&mdash;in the end, some of the things that we seek to achieve by abusing those powers will actually work against what we are trying to achieve for the Aboriginal people and for the people of Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I want to move back to the point that Senator Panizza was referring to earlier in relation to the definition of land and particularly airspace. I wanted to ask the minister whether or not he was aware that approximately two years ago in Western Australia the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable Judith Watson, by ministerial decree banned air flights over some Aboriginal sacred sites and reserves because they were doing magnetometer work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Whether he was or was not aware of that, I would like the minister to assure the committee in unequivocal terms that in no circumstances would the minister, the tribunal or anybody associated with this system be able to ban that sort of prospecting work from the air using magnetometers or any other form of exploration equipment and that people doing that sort of exploration work from the air would in no circumstances be required to create a permit. The precedent has certainly been set in Western Australia by the former Labor Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who did ban that exploration activity. That is why some of us from Western Australia have particular concerns about there needing to be any sort of application before the system to ensure that that sort of exploration can take place. I think it would be a very important guide for the future, if the minister can make that commitment here in the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>

That is a matter for determination; it is not to be assumed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question to bear in mind is the definition of `future permissible acts' and the freehold test that is associated with that. The essence of that freehold test is that what one can do in relation to freehold land one can do in relation to Aboriginal land. Since there are no inhibitions or restrictions as to what one can do basically about flying over freehold land, equally there would be no inhibitions or restrictions in terms of what one can do by way of flying over Aboriginal land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what else I can say to give comfort in that respect. It seems to me that, even if one did regard it as impacting on Aboriginal land and affecting the native title, one then gets into the realm of the low impact definition as another possible way through this.

The people in Western Australia who obviously went to the minister and said, `We want these flights banned because we don't want magnetometers over our land' are clearly still in Western Australia.

I do not know unequivocally the answer to the kind of question that she put because it depends on a number of variables. It depends on the way in which native title will be construed to exist for the particular site in question. It depends on the judgments that are made about airspace.

There are plenty of ways in which these competing interests can be sensitively balanced, and the ways of doing so are amply set out in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Five minutes ago I was almost certain that the minister had said that native title does not include airspace. Now I do not quite know. I do not want him to get up and go through it again. The further we get with this questioning, the more it seems to me that it does include airspace. Bearing in mind that Senator Campbell said that former minister Judith Watson in Western Australia banned magnetometer work over native land, I have grave fears that it might include airspace. If it does include airspace, I can see other problems, because it will affect not only magnetometer work. After all, magnetometer work is only measuring the magnetic field strength of the ground, so one is not even sending radio waves, gravitational waves into that land. It is simply measuring something from afar, the same as satellite imagery.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister can laugh as much as he likes. Those things go through that space. If there is any doubt on that, it will be tested in the High Court one day, sooner or later. I would have preferred the minister to completely rule it out and say that native title does not include airspace except whatever is reasonable, which would be what the CAA normally specifies. I would be very happy with that, but the minister brings all these other things in. The minister can have a go later at ruling it out but until it is ruled out, I am very frightened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one more definition that I would like to speak about. Someone has to ask this question tonight, so it may as well be me. What is the definition of an Aboriginal? Senator Evans has carried on about our spending 37 hours and 45 minutes or whatever debating this bill. This is also one of the most costly bills to ever go through the parliament. I assume that this bill will be passed tonight with the support of the Greens&mdash;the big enemies of Western Australia. Unless it is struck down by the High Court, the act will be around for a mighty long time&mdash;perhaps 100 years or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I ask the minister, quite earnestly, to give me a definition of `Aboriginal'. There are certain rights associated with being an Aboriginal. As Senator Bishop pointed out earlier, it is a case of South Africa revisited&mdash;although South Africa has now gone the other way. Certain rights and concessions are given based on Aboriginality. Fishing was one example. Aboriginals will have rights in that area, as well as other rights about which we have spoken for three or four days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want some idea of the definition. I could get two Aborigines to recognise me quite easily because I have known many over the years. I have a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yilgarn&mdash;Good Country for Hardy People</EMPHASIS> which is about the area I am from. If people were to take a cursory look at this they would find out about our family. I know that I may be accepted as an Aborigine if two people recognise me as such. I could go to Kalgoorlie and two members from one family would accept me. That means that I may be entitled to the licences which will be issued under this legislation. That is an extreme case, but I put it before the minister. </PARA>

I want to know what will be the minimum claim for Aboriginality in 99 years time. I am a first generation Australian. My grandchildren and great grandchildren&mdash;if I ever have any&mdash;will still have a little bit of Italian in them in 99 years time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This became an issue in the Tasmanian dams case where the legal concept that was given primacy was the notion of Aboriginal descent&mdash;that is, genealogy, relationships, establishable bloodlines, if you like; whatever that might mean, or whatever the quantum might be. That was not prescribed, and it has not been prescribed. The Commonwealth tends to use what is described as an `administrative definition' which, given the difficulty of establishing genealogy, descent and all those things for routine administrative purposes, operates on a combination of self-identification plus recognition and acceptance as an Aboriginal person. It is not a case of a couple of mates down the pub being prepared to say that they regard a person as such for the sake of whatever return might be in it, or something of that kind. It would have to be a better established test than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the legal definition is one essentially based on descent. As a practical matter, it is a combination of those other two factors. It is a matter really for Aboriginal people themselves to sort out, for practical purposes, whom they regard as satisfying this Aboriginality criterion. Certainly, in the context of native title applications of the kind that are in issue in this case, the kind of background and association with the land over a long time, whether in the context of physical direct proximity sustained over time or some other form of less physical connection, would generally be such as to leave little doubt as to who satisfies this description. Commonwealth legislation generally refers to `a person of the Aboriginal race', again emphasising the element of descent, genealogy, parentage, grand parentage and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very sensitive issues. In days gone by, considering the social contexts which prevailed at the time, it was unfortunately for a great many people a matter to be avoided. In latter days, mercifully and thankfully, Aboriginal descent and Aboriginality has become a matter of great pride. I hope that this legislation will be part of the process of reinforcing that pride. Maybe over time we can get better and clearer definitions. However, I suspect that it will be always a somewhat messy and imprecise business based on a combination, one way or another, of those three criteria: descent, self-identification and recognition and acceptance by others. I would like it to be clearer, because obviously it is a rather central, threshold issue which underlies many of these definitional issues, but it is not an issue about which it is possible to be more precise than I have been just now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to address the question of the definition of `land' and the inclusion of airspace. I want to deal very particularly with why I say that this legislation fails on two grounds. Firstly, it does not solve the uncertainty that flowed from the decision of the High Court in Mabo No. 2. Secondly, it is based upon providing different laws for Aboriginal Australians from those for the rest of Australians, which I believe is fundamentally wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in individuals; the government believes in collectives. It will always sacrifice the individual to the collective. I will never sacrifice the individual, including men, women, children and people of any ethnic background. Once they are Australians, they are entitled to the same respect, rights and hopes as each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at this definition, I see airspace. We have already established earlier in the debate that Aboriginal people have a right that ordinary Australians do not have&mdash;that is, the right to exclude people from their land, be they there perforce of state legislation or regulation. It can be the bush fire brigade, the police or whomever one chooses. Therefore, if one can be excluded from coming on to land, one can also be excluded from airspace. That is something that no other Australian can do. Ask Gary Punch and his residents in Rockdale, who complain about overflights and the building of the third runway. However, the government is providing for a right to be given to one group of Australians which is different from the right available to other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that I raised about the rights of women is a very serious one and needs to be addressed. There seems to be some sort of curious underlying acceptance by those who come into the category of collectivists that something that is cultural and discriminates against women is okay. I am here to tell them that it is not okay. As a woman and an Australian citizen, I am entitled to every right in this country that a man is entitled to. That includes the ability to be a pilot of an aeroplane and to fly over sites and engage in photographic exploration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an acceptance by some that there are certain things in Aboriginal culture which women may not see. I will not go into the reason for women being precluded; I am simply saying that, as a woman, I find it offensive. The net result is the possibility of a particular Aboriginal owner saying, `Women are not permitted to see this area or photograph it, but men are'. That automatically establishes the possibility of women&mdash;Australian women citizens&mdash;being discriminated against, simply because we have a piece of legislation setting up two sets of laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said it before and I will say it again: this is separate development; this is the beginnings of apartheid. That is something that I find un-Australian. I want Aboriginal people to enjoy their rights and entitlements to education and health&mdash;to all the things Australians regard as part and parcel of their expectations because the law and the rule of law guarantees them. There are plenty of examples of where it has not been possible for all Australians to take advantage of those things but that is not remedied by introducing laws which divide Australians into two categories&mdash;those subject to this piece of legislation and the rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a very funny way the government is making Aborigines second class citizens. There is so much in this bill that is paternalistic. Again and again, as specific questions have been asked of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) he has given his opinions. They have been very interesting to listen to but they are not worth a pinch of salt. We have heard either the minister's opinion or that of his advisers. The advisers have worked hard; they have given the minister much advice. But at the end of the day, it is the intention of the government and the ability of the written word to be interpreted by courts and/or tribunals that will finally determine the meaning of this piece of paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the minister that he is wrong when he says, as I heard him say earlier, that this legislation is a good piece of legislation because it meets the intent of the government. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is wrong in saying that he has solved these problems and has introduced a new era. We have opposed this legislation because it is fundamentally flawed. It is bad law. It is fundamentally flawed because it establishes two sets of laws&mdash;a them-and-us situation. By my definition, that is divisive. The minister and I differ fundamentally. I believe in the individual&mdash;that every single individual Australian has a right to be considered. The minister considers collectives, and if a few people fall by the wayside that is tough luck. </PARA>

She says that if this is so, we can extend it to airspace; and if we can extend it to airspace then women pilots flying over cultural sites are going to be discriminated against on the grounds of sex&mdash;and is that not terrible and the beginning of apartheid?</PARA>

To say that Aboriginal people with native title rights are capable of excluding others from the land is to wave a great big broad brush&mdash;which is simply not part of what native title rights are all about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the basic characteristic of native title rights, in terms of what one can do by way of excluding governmental and other acts over the land in question, is that of equivalence with the rights of ordinary freeholders. Over and over again in the legislation this concept of the freehold test is employed, not in order to produce an identity of native title rights with freehold rights&mdash;because there is not always the identity in terms of exclusive occupancy or anything else&mdash;but in terms of finding a common touchstone for determining whether there can be various forms of interference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The freehold test which applies in a number of different contexts is that if one can do something in relation to ordinary freeholders, then one can do it in relation to native titleholders.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A couple of special additional protections go to native titleholders&mdash;and let us understand what they are. There is a right to negotiate; which is not enjoyed by non-Aboriginal titleholders when it comes to the negotiation of mining interests over Aboriginal land in this sense. There is a right to negotiate created when there is a compulsory acquisition of native title land for third party purposes. That is not a right of negotiation which is available to ordinary land-holders in a freehold or roughly equivalent situation. There is a right to compensation on just terms for the extinguishment of native title; which is not applicable anywhere else in the legal system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we take out those three special protections of native title, it is very difficult to find any basic distinction between the native title right that is conferred and equivalent rights that may be applicable right now under the existing law of property. It is important that that be understood. Those special rights are there for a particular purpose and they are counted as special measures within the meaning of the Racial Discrimination Act and the international convention&mdash;and they have been identified clearly as such. They are exercises in positive discrimination with the rationale for that behind them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reference to another storey of the rickety edifice, I would point out that the notion that if we can exclude from land we can exclude from airspace again is based on a false premise. We cannot exclude from land any more than ordinary Australian titleholders can exclude from land other than in the context of rights to negotiate, which I have mentioned, which do not carry with them automatic rights to exclusion at all, and then only in very specific and narrow contexts. But it is not to be assumed that airspace is even to be regarded as part of native title. That is just part of the definition of land as employed in the bill. But right through the bill the issue is whether a particular piece of land and the airspace that goes with it is to be regarded as subject to native title rights or not. It is not making any assumptions about airspace being a part of the native title regime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to clarify the situation as to the Greens' amendments because they were rather complex when they were first introduced. The Greens are withdrawing their amendment No. 54. I would just like to run through the amendments that are not supported by the government which may gain some support from the Democrats and ask the minister some questions in relation to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greens' Amendment No. 44 refers to clause 213(9). We feel that that amendment should have been supported because it is inappropriate that future actions can be reflected as past acts, and that is exactly the effect of clause 213(9). An example of this is that the forestry reservation and logging agreement is a future act which gives permission to a future act. Yet in this bill it is being treated as a past act and is being validated. Obviously the Greens have concerns about this and wish to register it as the reason why they flagged amendment No. 44 and why we will be expressing a vote on it, even though we know that we do not have the support to pass that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some questions in relation to the next series of unsupported amendments. They are amendments 58, 62, 63 and 65. In relation to amendment 58, which refers to clause 222, page 104, paragraph (c), we simply put in that amendment to correct what we saw as a drafting error. In paragraphs (a) and (b) the reference to expedited procedures contains a reference to land and water and paragraph (c) refers only to land. Because there may be sacred waterholes or sites that should be covered as constituting `water', we believe it would be more appropriate to include that reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 62 and 63 relate to definitions of pastoral lease, not including a grazing licence. We feel that it is inappropriate that the clause does not include a grazing licence. We would like the minister's clarification. We placed amendment 63 on the record because we believed it corrected a drafting error to ensure that a revocation of recognition of a state-territory body can be made. Without this amendment, it may be argued that the minister has no power to revoke the standing of such a body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 65 removes from the definition of interest an inappropriate expansion of the normal meaning. The expansion covers restrictions on land which are not tied to any particular land in question. We would like the minister to clarify what he sees as the intent of clause 238(c). The other amendments not receiving support are amendments 36 and 38 which look at the bill's definition of native title mirroring the common law and allowing Aboriginal people to show connection with the land even if they have been displaced and unable to maintain continuous contact. We are very grateful that the government has indicated support for amendment 37 which makes it clear that past as well as future conversions of native title to statutory rights are to be treated as native title rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For clarification, I indicate that the other support that we have from the government is on amendment 39, which amends clause 210, where we are requiring that the native title tribunal makes a determination of those native title rights which it considers to be of importance without requiring the tribunal to list all rights exhaustively. We believe that an exhaustive listing would unnecessarily intrude on the culture and spirituality of native title claimants. We welcome the support of the Democrats and the government for that amendment. The next group of supported amendments&mdash;47, 49 and 51&mdash;are technical ones which take out the phrase, `in the same capacity'. We understand that that allows a transfer&mdash;</PARA>

I would like to speak to clause 14C and also to unsupported amendments 48 and 53. They relate to the pastoral lease situation which the Greens have felt most strongly about in Western Australia. Thirty-eight per cent of Western Australia is under pastoral lease control. This basically represents 500 pastoral leases. There are approximately 10,000 Aboriginal people living all over those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very grateful that the government has been able to include a clause 14C because it was very hurtful, in our view, that the Native Title Bill guaranteed extinguishment of a genuine native title claim if it were to prove the pastoral lease invalid. We believe that if that is deeply embedded in this legislation, and the government has proved intransigent on that, the least we can do is protect the people that may be living on those pastoral leases from dispossession. That is what clause 14C represents. I am indebted to the WA state legislation for clause 14C. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Premier of Western Australia, Richard Court, with one stroke of legislation, extinguished native title, he at least did one reasonable thing, which was to replace immediately any existing rights&mdash;the equity and usage rights that people have on land where they have had their proprietorial rights absolutely wiped out&mdash;with statutory and common law protection. That is the least we can do for people. If we are going to talk about validation&mdash;whether it is technical or just an endeavour to put economic certainty higher than recognition of native title rights&mdash;the least we can do is to ensure that Aboriginal people living on the land, where they and their families have lived for hundreds of years, are not dispossessed by a single act of the federal legislation.</PARA>

The initial reaction was that it was unnecessary but we may have been a little more persuasive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to amendment No. 58, the Greens wanted to include a reference to waters after the reference to land. The effect would be to allow acts that do not involve major disturbance to waters to proceed under the expedited procedure that is set out in the legislation. As presently drafted, it is only acts that do not involve major disturbance to land that can attract this procedure. The initial reaction of advisers was that disturbance to water was a rather difficult concept to come to terms with. That is why they were not originally moved by it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, since we are talking about both onshore and offshore waters and, as Senator Chamarette indicated when she spoke, questions of waterholes, rivers and riparian right equivalents and so on are at issue here, I do not see any harm in accepting the addition of the reference to waters. I think it is probably something where it is possible to contemplate a disturbance and, as such, an expedited procedure would not do any harm being applicable to that. As I said, it is a fairly minor, technical matter, but it is one that we can accept. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was amendment 58, which involved a small change to clause 222. As to amendment 62, I am afraid the Greens' luck is not so good. That is an amendment to clause 233, which we see as both unnecessary to achieve the policy objective the Greens are chasing there and is likely to create uncertainty, moreover, if it was put in there. I do not think there is any policy difference between us. It is just essentially a drafting argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to amendment 63, that is another technical drafting argument which boils down to a complicated half page of wrangling about the different grammatical tenses with which various concepts are expressed. Looking at the balance of the issues involved here, I think this is essentially a technical matter. There is no policy issue involved. The initial response that maybe the amendment was unnecessary seems to me perhaps a little robust. I think we can accept the amendment. It is not doing anything other than to clarify a particular clause which has a little bit of mystery about its drafting, which is probably penetrable at closer examination, but certainly is not at first sight. So we can accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to amendment 65, again being even-handed I have to say no. The definition as it stands does include, as an interest in land or waters, a right to stop other people doing something in relation to land or waters, such as having the benefit of a height restriction on buildings that can be erected on neighbouring land. It is important to validate any such restrictions which might well in certain circumstances be of value to, or protective of, the interests of Aboriginal people. We see this proposed amendment as potentially acting against the interests of Aboriginal people and, as such, perhaps it is a little misconceived. I hope that gives Senator Chamarette the answers she wanted on those amendments. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They might be pretty long clauses, but I think it is very indicative of the paucity of this legislation that the section the government has dedicated to definitions requires 20 government amendments to 25 clauses. The Greens and the Democrats are also proposing an additional 22 amendments to the area of definition. Is there any wonder that the confusion in the community is profound? The definitional areas of this legislation require 42 amendments for consideration. Of course, a number of them have already been withdrawn by the Democrats and the Greens as they have heard the discussion which has taken place and the arguments that we have put forward at this particular point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has indicated that there are about six or seven of the Green and Democrat amendments to which the government is enticed and is favourably disposed. The fact that there are so many, together with the 20 amendments that the government is seeking to 25 clauses of the legislation, speaks for itself. There is little wonder that this particular legislation will definitely end up in the High Court and will be to the disadvantage of Aboriginal Australians because of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me get specific with regard to the issues that I want to address. The first point that I want to address is the issue of stock routes. I am very pleased that Senator Chamarette has withdrawn the proposed amendment that she had put forward to the definition of public work to exclude stock routes. The effect of the amendment that was to be put forward on stock routes would have been that stock routes would not come within category A and would come within category D, to which the non-extinguishment principle applies. Parts of these strips of land, which frequently run through other properties and divide them, would have been subject to native title which would operate to the extent it had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the amendment had proceeded, a property holder would have had to negotiate the crossing of native title land to get from one part of a property to another&mdash;how ridiculous. Depending on the enforceability of laws on native title land, uncontrolled activity on the land would have affected the economic viability of any venture on the surrounding lands. I am extremely pleased that the Greens, after obviously being under pressure, have seen commonsense in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I want to address relates very specifically to clause 213. I was amazed when I first found this proposed amendment on the original Greens schedule. I note that they have since dropped it. But of course the Democrats have continued to pursue it, and that issue seeks an amendment which would potentially destroy the national parks system in the Northern Territory. It attempts to make all titles of the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory unable to be validated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Democrat amendment No. 37 proposes to insert a clause 213(10)(b) which provides that any grant to the Conservation Commission of the Northern Territory or the Northern Territory Land Corporation would be deemed not to be a past act. If grants are not a past act, they are not capable of being validated. The freehold and leasehold interests held by these bodies would then be invalid. This has the potential to destroy the national parks system in the Northern Territory. I really question whether this is the intention of the Democrats, given the very significant national parks, which number dozens now, being very well developed&mdash;I notice Senator Collins is nodding; I am pleased to see that endorsement&mdash;by the Conversation Commission of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that the Democrats are proposing is discriminatory and ill-considered and it should be&mdash;thankfully, the minister has indicated that it will be&mdash;totally rejected. The Democrats, in their centralist Canberra driven-style of management and control, have no confidence or trust in the Northern Territory government. Anybody who walks through the Northern Territory as a tourist would be well aware of the sensitivity about national parks and their importance, not only to tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third issue I want to raise concerns the Greens' amendment 14C which relates specifically to subclause 196(b) of the bill. The bill currently provides that pastoral leases fall within the definition of category A, past act, and, if validated, extinguish native title. Clause 15 provides that any reservation for the benefit of Aboriginal people must be preserved when a pastoral lease is validated. The government's proposed subclause 208(4) specifies that a statutory reservation for Aboriginal people in a pastoral lease is not to be taken as being native title. From these provisions, it would appear that governments would be able to deal with pastoral land in the future since any activity would not affect native title. The Greens' proposed amendments dramatically change the ability of pastoralists and governments to deal with pastoral land. The amendments seek to enforce a permanent right of residence and access of Aborigines to all pastoral lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of these amendments will be that all pastoral land will be frozen according to its current use. Never again will pastoral land be able to be used for some alternative purpose which is inconsistent with those rights of residence or access. For example, there will be no more tourist developments on pastoral lease land, no pastoral leases on the edges of town could be subdivided and no pastoral leases could be used for agricultural purposes. It may be that these problems could be overcome by compulsory acquisition of the right of residence, but at what cost? The economic impact of these proposals on future governments will be quite substantial. Given that the minister is inclined to accept these amendments, I ask very specifically: how will it affect land management on pastoral leases?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; it is the Greens' amendment 14C. Senator Spindler does not need to be quite as strident in his identification. The purpose of this amendment is to guard against the possible effects of the validation provisions on Aboriginal people whose legal rights have been extinguished, despite the fact that they have access to or reside on a pastoral property. Clause 15 already provides protection for Aboriginal people who benefit from a reservation in the legislation or a lease or otherwise have rights under the common law or rights of usage. Amendment 14C affords protection to any Aboriginal people currently living on or with access to validated pastoral leases who are not protected by clause 15.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment, I guess, is moved against the background of some of the really very dark moments in the history of our country when Aboriginal people were forcibly dispossessed of their land, in many cases to live just in corners of their former domains by the grace and favour of the new owners. In some cases Aboriginal people living on pastoral leases had the protection of legal rights and, by virtue again of clause 15, the validation of any such pastoral leases will preserve those legal rights. Having considered this whole matter rather carefully, the government believes that it is right to afford this additional protection for Aboriginal people who are unable to demonstrate a right under the law to their presence on pastoral leases other than any native title rights which might be extinguished as a result of the provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment provides that such people cannot be ejected or removed from the property simply by virtue of any such extinguishment. I think it does convey, accordingly, a pretty important message. It may well be that the whole context of validation, as I have said so many times before, is a largely theoretical one, but in the practical world of actually identifying pastoral lease properties where there was an invalid grant by virtue of the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act and so on, and that has subsequently to be validated, it may be that those cases will prove to be theoretical only and that, in practice, there were few, if any, actual such examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent there may have been examples, and it seems likely that the part of the country where this issue is most likely to arise is the Kimberleys to the north-west of Western Australia, and to the extent it may have practical impact the question of forcible ejection and dispossession may have some practical relevance utility, as well as being a standard in principle set by the legislation and, as such, we support it accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Tambling still has not answered my question about how this legislation is supposed to stop subdivisions, tourist developments and all the things he is talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me begin again at the beginning. What we are talking about here is the validation of notionally invalid leases by virtue of the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act or some other law in connection with the law of native title. We are not talking about valid pastoral leases or other kinds of leases that always have been valid and in respect of which no credible suggestion arises about invalidity. We are only talking about those which may be invalid. The standard case that people think of in this respect is invalid by virtue of the non-discriminatory provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act&mdash;which came into operation in 1975, not before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are not many pastoral leases that have been granted anywhere in the country since 1975. Even those that have been notionally identified as new pastoral leases after 1975 are subject to an argument, I understand, that maybe these were not new pastoral leases at all but simply continuations in a slightly different guise of earlier granted leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the question of whether or not, if they were granted after 1975, we can say they were granted in a way that was offensive to the Racial Discrimination Act because no compensation was paid&mdash;this being in a situation, of course, where nobody knew at that stage, until 1982, that there was such a thing as native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have to erect theoretical possibility upon theoretical possibility, and we are only doing it in relation to a very small proportion of the number of pastoral leases that exist in this particular country&mdash;a tiny proportion, at best. The suggestion from the National Farmers Federation is that there might have been somewhere between two and 13 such leases that would, prima facie, come within the scope of this legislation. That is out of all the thousands of pastoral leases which exist across the length and breadth of this country. So, when we are talking about dire consequences following from any reading of the effect of the validation clause, we are only talking about this theoretical possibility in relation to a tiny proportion of the total number of pastoral leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, when we do focus on that as being the particular situation we are talking about, we then see the effect of this particular clause. Bearing in mind that the effect of clause 14 is to extinguish any Aboriginal native title that may have existed as a result of the validation exercise, what it says is that the extinguishment effected by this section does not, by itself, confer any right to eject or remove any Aboriginal persons who reside on or who exercise access over land or waters covered by a pastoral lease which has been, in effect, validated. That is all we are talking about. The extinguishment by itself does not confer any right to eject or remove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other ways under the law, as spelt out in this legislation, by which such a removal of Aboriginal people could be accomplished. One is by agreement&mdash;they might choose, in effect, to renounce or relinquish their physical possession of a particular part of the area in question to which they might otherwise have established some non-extinguished right and to use that as the basis for an agreement with a tourist development or something of that kind. Again, we have the compulsory acquisition provisions which apply to any non-extinguished native title situation anywhere in the country and which would equally apply in this situation, with the compensation that is payable pursuant to that acquisition varying depending on the nature of the title, the interest and so on. So we have ways of achieving the result that may be necessary for economic development purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I repeat: Senator Tambling is only looking at the operation of this whole clause in the context of an essentially theoretical validation exercise. There are some big principles attached to this subclause&mdash;and we think it is not unimportant to state these principles for the reasons I have spelt out. But, in terms of its practical impact, on any view the impact of this clause will not be great. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have attempted in this debate over the last few days to keep my comments very focused on the interests of the Northern Territory and Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. I made a number of comments in my speech during the second reading debate and throughout the committee stage. I focused very specifically on issues that will impact and I drew various comparisons between this bill, which I consider to be very fundamentally flawed, and the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory. This bill, with 238 clauses and over 200 amendments proposed here in the last few days, is very indicative of the changes that are expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal Australians who are expecting a major change from this legislation will be very disappointed that many of their expectations have not been met. Those who are expecting social justice will have to wait until next February for the Prime Minister's response. Those Aboriginal Australians who were looking to this legislation for respect for their traditional customs and lore will again be sorely disappointed because the points that were raised in various forums have not been met, and they will be let down by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others who hope that the legislation will deliver Aborigines from government dependency will also be disappointed. There is a lack of certainty for industry to operate and expand. That has been very well demonstrated by reports in the last week or so and certainly in many other areas. There is a failure to enhance private sector employment opportunities for Aboriginal and other Australians. And that is the greatest issue facing the federal government at the moment&mdash;how do we provide private sector employment for all Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation fails to address the inconsistencies, as I have said time and again, with the Aboriginal Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory, particularly as it affects mining exploration, confidence, investment, pastoral management, and access to waterways, river beds and river banks. I am fearful that, because of the government's, the Greens' and the Democrats' unnecessary haste with this legislation, it will now inevitably end up in the High Court for years and years and, consequently, the losers will be Aboriginal Australians. Labor's relentless push seems to be driven by an international agenda and a timetable rather than reason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to the comments by Senator Tambling about our amendment which seeks to ensure that native title claims are not excluded from the conservation-land corporation areas established under the conservation commission legislation of the Northern Territory or the Northern Territory Land Corporation established under the Northern Territory Land Corporation Act 1986. The reason is very simple: these structures were used, and possibly intentionally established, to withdraw large tracts of land from native title claim by setting these corporations up and saying that they were deemed not to be crown land so that native title claims could not be made. That is the legal reason why we think that such subterfuge should not be permitted. We have added subsection (d) which, for good measure, prohibits any act in bad faith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the substantive issue, of course.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not withdraw it because Senator Tambling's claim that these national parks should not be available to native title indicates that you believe that the two are incompatible, whereas they are clearly compatible. We only have to look at the way Aboriginal people have looked after the natural environment and the way we have despoiled it in the 200 years that we have been here. Clearly, the two are not incompatible, and we should not use a somewhat surprising concern for the natural environment as a reason to exclude vast areas from native title claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also comment on one or two other things Senator Tambling said in his general comments. He adverted to the fact that this bill, when it becomes an act and its various provisions come into effect, will not provide sufficient protection for employment or sufficient incentive for economic activity. I believe that as a nation we must reconcile what is social justice in this particular case with our economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, when we have a nation that is proud of its identity and has resolved an inherent conflict because of the unjust act that we as a country have perpetrated on indigenous people, we will benefit both economically and socially. We must bite the bullet, if I can put it that way, and do at the moment what is just. In the long term this will not be an economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel privileged to have been part of this process. People have said that this legislation is extremely complex, and so it is. But the process to get it through this chamber has been even more complex. When we look at the various people who have been involved in developing this legislation and in reconciling the myriad of different political views that have existed, it is little short of a miracle. But miracles do not happen, and I think we should take heart from this process for the future of Australia. If we can make this work, it augurs well for us as a nation&mdash;just as if we had not made it work, if we had failed today, it would have been a bad sign for the future of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to reflect briefly that just about every participant in this process started with different political expectations and aspirations.

As it is, we have reconciled&mdash;I believe successfully, although I appreciate that views differ&mdash;the various interests and expectations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also put on record that we owe a gratitude to the Prime Minister, Paul Keating. It is not often that I agree with the Prime Minister, I must say. But on this occasion it is useful and right, I believe, to put on record that we owe this bill ultimately to his single-minded conviction that this must be achieved. I believe that Cheryl Kernot, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, and the two Green senators also deserve a mention. I know that Cheryl has had a longstanding commitment to this particular aim. She is a member of the Aboriginal Reconciliation Council, and I know that in the last few weeks and months she has lived almost exclusively to this end. I would also like to say that while at times we have found the positions adopted by our Green friends somewhat exasperating, they too played a part; they too provided a building block in the political process that has finally achieved what we have tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before this debate finally draws to a close, there are some matters in this section that I feel compelled to raise with the minister. I refer to amendment No. 50A of the government dealing with clause 208. I want to know what the government's intention was here, because subclause 208(4) has been changed. As I see it, it works like this: Senator Evans said that subclause (3) gave a rebirth to native title as a result of state legislation; he referred to Western Australia but it was to refer to all states. This subclause says that, to avoid any doubt, that subclause does not apply to rights and interests created by a reservation in relation to a pastoral lease, provided those reservations are not native title rights and interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, in Western Australia, and in other states, there are reservations on pastoral leases&mdash;this goes back some time now&mdash;which have specifically allowed Aboriginal people in the area to hunt on the property, to traverse across the property. It has been said that in those cases the pastoral lease does not necessarily extinguish native title completely because these reservations or conditions on the pastoral leases are effectively reserving the rights of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why then has the government brought about this change in the amendment to say that these reservations and conditions are not included in subclause (3), which are not native title rights and interests? That is implying that some of them might be and might not be. That is the confusion I find. Can the minister enlighten me?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will do the best that I can. Senator Ellison will be aware that under clause 208(3) the definition of `native title' includes native title rights and interests which have been compulsorily converted into statutory rights. This amendment provides that rights and interests which have been created by reservations or by conditions in pastoral leases&mdash;whether in the lease or by virtue of the legislation under which the lease was granted&mdash;are not converted by subclause (3) into native title. Because these rights and interests are created by statute, they cannot be native title under the definition in clause 208(1). This provision, 208(4), is making clear that 208(3) does not result in these rights being treated as native title by this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, under the common law, a native title survives the grant of the pastoral lease&mdash;that is, of course, an issue that remains to be tested&mdash;it will then fall within the definition of native title in clause 208(1). The determination of this issue is left for the common law. We are not trying to pre-empt that process at the moment. That is again a rather complex explanation, but I hope it makes sense. If Senator Ellison has any further questions, I am happy to try to wrestle with them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are not excluded if, as a matter of common law litigation, they were held to be capable of surviving the grant of the pastoral lease. The matter in issue in all of this&mdash;the great unresolved issue at common law&mdash;is whether the granting of a pastoral lease will succeed in extinguishing native title. The working assumption which underlies this bill is yes, it will, because that is the result that is pointed to by so many of the judgments in the Mabo case; but it has not been absolutely and finally determined. There is a strong sentiment around the place, understandably, that rather than pre-empting that issue we should leave it to the courts to finally resolve it. That issue is still left for resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the process that is laid out in this particular complex set of provisions, the working assumption of the legislation is that the bits of title that we are talking about were created by statute originally and were not the product of the common law existence and, therefore, do not come within the scope of this particular statutory provision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been a long four days and we have covered a good deal of ground in this bill. But I just finish on the note that the complexity of this bill never ceases to amaze me. As has just been demonstrated in that last exchange, it still might be that this has to be resolved by a court. We are not left with any sufficiency of certainty. I will give the committee an example. If one looks at the definitions section, one sees the definition of `native title party'. If one looks at clause 29, we see that phrase mentioned there. One then goes to clause 207 which contains the list of definitions. Under the phrase `native title party', one is referred to clause 238. When one goes to clause 238, the meaning of `native title party' is set out. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"native title party"</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the third clause that we have looked at&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has the meaning given by paragraphs 28(2)(a) and (b) and section 29;</PARA>
<PARA>So we then go back to clauses 28 and 29, which is where we started. We then have to wrestle mentally with what `native title party' is. That is just one phrase which appears in the bill; there are many others. With due respect to the government, I do not believe that this bill has effectively addressed the issue. Any person who picks up this bill and reads it to see what redress or cause of action they would have would be seriously confused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that this is a very complex situation. I have been very lucky to have served on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and to have had the benefit of lawyers advising the government on this situation. I compliment them on their work. Mr Orr has been most helpful in the questions that I put to him. Nonetheless, we have a bill which is so complex that the average man or woman would have no chance to come to grips with it. This chamber has been wrestling with it now for four days. I think we have seen just how many pitfalls there are in relation to the bill's efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside the purposes for such a bill, the ideals which it is supposed to promote and the problems that it seeks to address, my thrust is whether it does the job. That is what legislation is all about. I know that, because laws are imperfect and human beings are imperfect, the system will never run perfectly; it will never be that smooth. But the responsibility stops in this chamber to make sure that the legislation we pass does work and can run as smoothly as possible without leaving matters to be determined in the courts, which will give batteries of lawyers lots of work to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember a client of mine who once said that the problem with the law is that it is not simple. I asked him how he would fix it. He said that he would simplify it, so I asked him how he would do that. He replied that he would make it more simple. I could see that I was getting nowhere with him. It is very easy to say that legislation should be simple but, when day-to-day events in human affairs, especially over a passage of time, evolve and are determined, they become more and more complex. So any piece of legislation which sets out to govern human affairs and behaviour always offers a very difficult task to the person setting out on that course. I do not think the definitions and the drafting&mdash;not necessarily the style of drafting, but the way in which this bill is set up&mdash;are an effective response to the Mabo No. 2 decision. </PARA>
<PARA>I finish by referring to another aspect. The bill quite cleverly divides past acts on one side and future acts on the other; that is, what category of acts has gone before and what is to come. That would seem to be the most reasonable approach. The problem with the definition of past acts is that it says, if one were granted a lease in the past and one has an option to renew it in the future, that act in the future is really a past act. That is one of the most confusing things about this legislation. I could cite more examples but time does not permit me to do so tonight. The same applies to future acts, impermissible acts and permissible future acts. That is the reason I wish to place on record my grave concerns about how this bill will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the minister's endeavours to assist me over the last four days with the inquiries I have made of him and I do appreciate the assistance given by his advisers. But I must respectfully say that, at the end of the day, I am not drawn to the conclusion that this bill will work. Time will tell; it will be only by experience in the courts that we will unfortunately discover these flaws. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I agree, that is a pearler of a response. I am very grateful to Senator Crane for actually allowing me to comment on amendment 14C&mdash;and the various other titles that it went by&mdash;which amended clause 14, because that really represents the major sticking point that the Greens (WA) had with this legislation as a whole. We had no problem with clause 13, which was the validation of all past leases. We felt that that was a reasonable and appropriate response from the government in view of expressions of uncertainty and concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we felt that the principle was very strongly supported that coexistence of native title with validated leases was a totally appropriate response. The technical point conveyed was that a lease may be invalidated because it was issued after 1975, and, due to the fact that native title could be appropriately held to be present on it, it should by this legislation be extinguished even though compensation was paid to make it valid and make it conform to the RDA. At the same time as calling itself the Native Title Bill, this bill actually extinguished some rights somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that many times in question time in the House of Representatives and certainly in the Senate we were trying to elicit how many people would be affected by this particular clause. While we have not been able to gain much information, certainly the concerns of the Greens (WA) lay in the area of pastoral leases. We believe that there may be in the region of 11, or X number, of those. There is no way of telling at the moment whether they will involve any other kinds of leases. But our principle still stands. While validation of a pastoral lease or a commercial lease is appropriate&mdash;this would involve the pearling industry or a tourist lease&mdash;the principle of coexistence should have been an integral part of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were unable to support the bill until the government was in agreement with something in the order of our amendment 14C. Mind you&mdash;and Senator Crane knows this&mdash;there were many other sticking points which we did fight for, but this was the one that really hit home in Western Australia. Basically, we regard that clause as a protection against dispossession. We regard it as one of the basic requirements of human rights that, if validation does happen to lead to extinguishment, the least we can do is make sure that Aboriginal people do not suffer what they suffered when we had the equal pay debate many years ago, and in the other ways that they have suffered in the last 200 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that I cannot give Senator Crane any details about the pearling industry. As far as we know, it is a theoretical possibility only that a native title entitlement of some kind may put into question another kind of lease.

As the honourable senator praised the Western Australian legislation&mdash;I must say we would not do that because we feel it is a violation of indigenous people's rights&mdash;he will be glad to know that, as I said earlier, the clause we chose was modelled after what the Premier of Western Australia did. Where he has extinguished title, he has provided total support for whatever was in existence so that nobody could be dispossessed. We have to give him credit for that at least. </PARA>

The honourable senator's amendment refers to those `who exercise access over land or waters'. As far as pastoral leases are concerned&mdash;I am now talking about running sheep and cattle basically&mdash;is it intended that that part of the clause will confer more rights than exist now under the reservations that have been made?</PARA>

So if there are any complexities that I am not aware of, he would be more aware of them. </PARA>

It was not to cause any interference whatsoever in the validation process or the process that is possible. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ask Senator Spindler a couple of questions with regard to clause 53. I ask the honourable senator firstly: why is this amendment drafted in such a way that it will not cover the creation of new leases in Western Australia? Since Senator Spindler moved this amendment, he would be aware that there has to be new legislation in Western Australia to allow new leases to be created. There is no provision for lease renewal or an extension of time; there has to be a new lease. Secondly, in putting forward an amendment such as this, why has he discriminated against the mining industry? So there are two points: firstly, why has he discriminated against Western Australian pastoral lease holders; secondly, why has he discriminated against the mining industry?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer the first question: this particular amendment is directed towards the renewal or extension of leases. It does not prohibit the granting of new leases, it simply does not deal with them because that is not its intention. We realise that new leases will be created on Crown land&mdash;there is no objection to that&mdash;but this amendment simply does not deal with that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the second question: the distinction we make between mining and pastoral leases is simply based on the different kinds of activity carried out under the terms of each lease. Whereas a pastoral lease, unless it is simply a grazing licence, requires exclusive occupation for long periods of time, a mining lease is limited to intensive operations for a short period of time. Since mining leases do not extinguish native title, and native title revives after the mining operation has concluded, there was no reason to give additional security to them. </PARA>

There are 400 pastoral leases in Western Australia and the only way they can continue to exist to the year 2015 is for a new lease to be created, and I think that is very sad.

There is no single clause in it which has been demonstrated to have any fundamental flaw. There were a couple of minor things along the way that we have said probably deserve some scrutiny and possibly some attention in a later review exercise, but there are no conceptual defects. There are no flaws of a self-evident kind.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Native Title Bill has been passed with 115 amendments. Less than two weeks ago, in the second reading debate, we were told that there was no need for any amendments, that the government fully understood all that was required, that there was no complexity or uncertainty and that the bill deserved to be passed in that form. The fact is that this bill ended up having one less amendment before the chair than there are clauses&mdash;238 clauses with 237 amendments. Ninety-nine government amendments were ultimately put before this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight an historic opportunity has been lost. No-one, let alone any political party, has a monopoly on compassion or concern or social justice. Australians very much appreciate that there are very many Australians, particularly Aboriginal Australians, living in conditions of extreme social and economic disadvantage. The solution to those problems lies in addressing those issues on the merits. We have always been committed to doing just that. We have been enthusiastic participants in the reconciliation process&mdash;much as those opposite would like that to be yet another point of division between the political parties, because they have the most divisive political leader in Australian history who is intent on polarising the nation. But we supported the government and we supported the Australian community in terms of the reconciliation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the High Court decision is not about reconciliation. The High Court decision was a landmark decision which recognised for the first time a different and distinctive form of land title, known as native title. That decision had inevitable consequences, which we accept. The approach to land management in this country has been altered and as a result there is a need for a governmental and legislative response. But that does not mean that we need to have a bill rammed through this parliament in the disgraceful jackboot way we have seen over the last four days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This decision of the High Court demanded a sensitive, considered and consultative approach. After all, the decision was handed down in June 1992. It took the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) almost six months to even turn his mind to it in the lead-up to the election campaign. It took almost a further 12 months before the bill was introduced into the parliament. Quite clearly, the government had enormous trouble grappling with the complexity of the decision. What was required above all was to consult&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You cannot say that; you rammed through our amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook is hardly ever here; I do not think he would understand it. He should stick to rams and we will stick to bills. The fact is that there was a perfect opportunity for the government to practise the politics of inclusion and go out into the highways and byways to take evidence in a proper and civilised manner, to try to involve the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government pays lip service to the fact that land management is a state responsibility. What does it then do? It introduces a bill which is utterly and completely about taking away the rights of the states to make land management decisions. There was no attempt at all to recognise the very different conditions which prevail across Australia. Australia is a federation which tries to bring together very different states, very different regional areas and very different conditions under which its citizens exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My state of Victoria does not have a significant problem with the Mabo legislation. The state of Western Australia, on the other hand, has a very big problem with Mabo because at the moment about 12 per cent of the land mass of Western Australia is already covered by Aboriginal reserves, special purpose grants and the like, and another 30 per cent or thereabouts is vacant crown land and therefore potentially claimable under this legislation. Western Australia has a unique condition which needs to be addressed separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet what does the Prime Minister want to do? He basically wants to treat the premiers with contempt. He wants to get through a uniform solution to a series of very different problems. That is the politics of exclusion. There is no serious attempt to recognise the problems that are faced by farmers and miners. They just happen to be pandering to all the greenophobia that comes out from certain sections&mdash;`They are the ones who are ripping it out and flogging it; they are the ones who are causing the problems; they are the ones who are devastating the environment'. There is never any recognition these days from the greatest economic rationalist of the 1980s that Australia's real future and real prospects of prosperity in the years ahead lie in economic development, in increased living standards, in greater employment opportunities and in the capacity to deliver increased welfare and support to those in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all comes from economic solutions which do not pretend there is a pot of gold, which do not on the one hand say, `Here's a bill that will directly benefit five per cent of the Aboriginal community; the other 95 per cent will be picked up by a land fund or social justice package. We can't put a figure on it, we want a blank cheque, but we can tell you that it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars over the next 15 or 20 years'. Of course, this is together with all the litigation that will have to ensue. If there is one thing we know, it is that we are starting off on a long and tortuous road&mdash;and that road leads immediately to the High Court of Australia. If the Canadian experience is any guide, it will lead to 20 years of litigation followed by royal commissions from time to time. All of this means&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where is your alternative?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our alternative was a 12-point plan which we laid down before the Australian public. It involved an acknowledgment of the validity of the High Court decision and a need to address the very important native title rights that were proclaimed by that court. We also accepted the need for the Racial Discrimination Act to prevail over any other land management decisions hereafter; to the extent that there was any infringement, then compensation would need to be paid on just terms. Also, fundamentally, we acknowledged that land management decisions remained the responsibility of the states. That was the basis for an inclusive and considered approach to an historic High Court decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, after 18 months of trying to come to grips with the decision, trying to get a COAG meeting to agree, suddenly the Prime Minister said, `That's it, I've had enough. I'm going to force this bill through. I'm going to put it before the parliament. I'm going to ensure that the Senate gets it through, by hook or by crook'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go a little further. I do not want any misunderstanding about this as it is very important. The fact is that we are committed to addressing Aboriginal disadvantage; we are committed to properly implementing the decision of the High Court. But we would not do it in the way that those opposite have sought to do it: by an approach that is essentially divisive, that has essentially polarised the nation and that will lead to very severe economic and social consequences in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the urgency about this? The urgency was that, for the Prime Minister's political convenience, this bill was to be passed through the parliament before Christmas. The fact that the bill goes well beyond the Mabo decision is simply something which is brushed aside. The miners are clearly self-interested and selfish&mdash;ignore them. In other words, if there is a problem&mdash;if Mr Farley falls off the cart; if the miners say they cannot hack it any longer; if all of the Liberal leaders and the state premiers around Australia, except Mr Goss, who of course threw his own separate tantrum, say that the legislation is unworkable&mdash;he ignores all of that. He just says to Senator Evans, `You've got your riding instructions; I'll get out there one day and say that we'll sit through until Christmas; but you go away and work out how you can guillotine this legislation through the parliament'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a swag of amendments next year&mdash;we know that&mdash;all because of the fact that we continue to have no idea of the ultimate consequences of this legislation. Therefore, I say that this is merely the start of a long process. We will continue to take a constructive approach to the problems of Australia. We will not pretend that somehow we can redress the problems overnight; we will not pretend that the solutions lie in blaming ourselves and our forebears. We will look ahead; we will look at the country's capacity to afford to address these issues; and we will do this in the most sensible and inclusive way we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just simply say in passing that, given that we do not have the phalanx of advisers who are available to the government, we are grateful for the services of Peter van Hatten, who has been with us for the last four days providing us with invaluable assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final thing I would say is this: we did not move amendments to this legislation because it would have been tinkering at the edges. It could not possibly&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am waiting for the rabble to subside. I cannot help saying in passing that the name Democrat has been abused beyond recognition in this chamber by the Leader of the Democrats, who the other day asked why it was that there was a need for anyone to make a personal explanation. She refused to acknowledge, presumably, the most basic right that we all have&mdash;the right of freedom of speech, the right of freedom of expression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot denied the legitimacy of a need to make a personal explanation which in itself when allowed resulted in Senator Evans conceding that indeed we had not filibustered, that the debate had been of a very high calibre and that there were a number of very constructive contributions. So let us not have the humbug. Let us not pretend that anyone has a mortgage on virtue. We maintain that there was a better way. The government had the chance and blew it. We, as citizens of Australia, will all have to live with the consequences for a very long time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We now have a Native Title Bill which is, in effect, unworkable. We are putting at risk 160,000 direct jobs and 470,000 indirect jobs in the mining industry&mdash;that is all at risk. We are putting at risk $37 billion in export earnings, $20 billion in mining earnings and $17 billion in agricultural earnings. That has been the sum total of the debate that has been going on now for some eight or nine days; the days have merged into each another as we have debated this through till midnight and then resumed at 9 o'clock in the morning. That is where we are at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going establish a land fund to help the Aborigines who will not be picked up by this legislation. No-one knows what that will cost or how that will fit into the government's deficit reduction strategy. How much will taxes be increased to pay for this?  How is it all going to be paid for?  What will be the cost on jobs? What is the cost on Kelty's regional development task force?  He has identified that unemployment in regional areas is very high and will now go much higher. It will be much harder for Aborigines to get work in those areas&mdash;all those things will be the repercussions and the fall-out that we will go through to have this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will only make it worse for Australia. Already we have seen a lot of industry moving offshore, and the bill clearly has not resolved uncertainty. But the government now has to accept that there will have to be amendments. There will be problems with the mining and pastoral industries, and the government will now be obliged to bring in amendments that will hold those massive job creating and wealth creating industries in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation will affect not only white Australians but also black Australians. The long debate has exploited the difficulties that we will see in the mining industry and the pastoral industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I personally do not like the bill. I think it will be very harmful to Australia. The bill may benefit 12,000 Aborigines but it discriminates against the rest of Australia&mdash;16 million Australians will not pick up anything from this bill. But, ultimately, the numbers are there for the bill to go through, and I can count that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Australian people will have to accept the bill if they accept parliamentary democracy in Australia. Until the government is changed and the numbers in the Senate fall our way, it is a matter of fact that the bill will be law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity that we have had to have some negativity at the end of this historic debate tonight on the Native Title Bill. It is a pity that we did not have cross-party support for something so important for Australia's future. The fact is that tonight a majority of the Australian parliament has done a wonderful, historic thing for indigenous Australians and for Australia itself. Although delivered 205 years late, we have delivered just a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians. We have put aside the myth of terra nullius. We have said at last that we are prepared to own our history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things surrounding this debate that I think we should look at is that of the process. The opposition said that it had no amendments and that we were all at fault because we had 99&mdash;or however many there were. The fact is that those amendments were the outcome of a constructed, negotiating process in which the opposition chose not to be involved. Those opposite cannot cope with this new process. They prefer to deal themselves out every single time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Native Title Bill 1993, having been substantially amended by the Senate, is now a piece of legislation that the Greens (WA) can support. Our position on this legislation has always been that it should support and build on the positive decision of the High Court in Mabo and others v. Queensland, 1992. Any legislation arising from that decision should be of benefit to Australia's indigenous people and, as a bottom line, should not directly harm the present position of Aboriginal people, nor should it inhibit their capacity in the future to seek further development of their native title rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, as presented to and passed by the House of Representatives, fell well short of that aim. But now, with the major amendments that have been negotiated and passed during the committee stage, the bill has been modified from the original aims that we believe were being expressed. First and foremost it seemed a bill for every other vested interest in this country before Aboriginal rights were addressed. I regard the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 October 1993 as a prophetic one. In that article, Professor Henry Reynolds said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A principal objective of the Bill is to validate all existing titles, to provide up-front statutory security for every conceivable interest. No one, it seems, is forgotten&mdash;owners, lessees, licensees, holders of interests in minerals/water . . . and anyone else whose interests might in any way be infringed by native title.</PARA>
<PARA>That was what it could have been. I believe that it has now changed because some restraints have been applied to that and some respect has been achieved for the traditional rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. As Henry Reynolds says in his article, there could have been a truly even-handed approach which could have had a very different outcome&mdash;even from this piece of legislation that we are passing here tonight. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government, as Professor Garth Nettheim suggested some time ago, could have declared that all recent Crown land with resident Aborigines could be presumed to be held under native title. The onus would then have fallen on the Crown to prove the contrary, to establish if, when and how, extinguishment had taken place. Such an approach would have been fully in the spirit of the High Court's Mabo judgment.</PARA>
<PARA>The process has been very different. The Greens (WA) would have liked to have seen the approach to a native title bill starting with communication with the elders of the communities around Australia. Robert Bropho of the Nyungah circle of Elders has maintained and insisted all along that there will be no harmony and success if the two laws do not agree with one another. That need for consultation is ever present and needs to be addressed by the committee that will be an outcome of this bill. Regional agreements and better consultation processes are possible, and I urge that we do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to remind ourselves, as we consider the final stage of this legislation, of the history of Australia since 1788. It is also important to ask ourselves at this time: what does this piece of legislation really mean; what do we hope to achieve from its passage; and, more importantly, where do we go from here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight, we must move on&mdash;some very gratefully. Tonight, we must take the next step on the continuing road towards justice for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Tonight, Senator Dee Margetts and I wish to pay tribute to all the people from all over the country who have brought us to this stage, for tonight is a night that we did not believe would occur. We did not believe that the government would have come so far towards meeting our concerns and the concerns expressed by representatives from indigenous organisations from all over Australia. That it has done so is a tribute to the dedication and commitment of the people&mdash;many of whom are present tonight in the gallery. We thank the Australian Democrats and some strong supporters from the Australian Labor Party. We pay tribute to Senator Gareth Evans for his effort in guiding this Senate through the complex procedural maze of the committee process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Senator Margetts and I also pay tribute to the large number of Aboriginal people who have come from our state of Western Australia. We thank you for being here. Finally, I express appreciation towards the Aboriginal negotiators and the myriad people who trooped in and out of our offices, not to mention the dedicated if not courageous lawyers, and the ecumenical prayer group that met daily during this last few days. We thank you for the patience and persistence that you have had with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I especially remember those who did not want this bill to be passed but who did respect that the Greens would be trying to raise their concerns and make an effective input into this legislation. I here refer to the Miriuwung and Gajerrong Families Heritage and Land Council, the Nyungah Circle of Elders, with Robert Bropho, Yaluritja&mdash;Clarrie Isaacs, Mingeli Wanguri, and all the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens' philosophy is that we must acknowledge the historical injustice that we have done in this country to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people before reconciliation is possible. The world is moving towards recognition of indigenous people's contributions and culture and rights, which is part of the healing of the planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with a quote from Paul Behrendt, the Director of the Aboriginal Research and Resource Centre, himself an Aboriginal person, who gave a talk at the Martung Upah Indigenous Conference called, `A Just and Proper Settlement', which I regard as ironic. After I have completed my speech I will seek leave to table this document which relates to the history of our country from the perspective of the University of New South Wales Aboriginal Research and Resource Centre. Paul Behrendt said in his speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A native Canadian once said that while governments will come and go, and court decisions will come and go native people will remain the same as we were before anybody else came here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And so it is in this country. I do not know what the mix of the population will be in a hundred years time but I will give you a written guarantee that we are going to be here, and by not addressing the issues that affect contemporary Aboriginal society you will simply be bequeathing the problems to our grand children in much the same way that your grand parents left them to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may then be fortuitous to mark Xavier Herbert's words when he said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until we give back to the black man some of what we have taken from him, and give it back in the same spirit that it was taken&mdash;without provisos or strings to snatch it back, we shall remain what we have always been, a people without a soul, not a nation, but a community of thieves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people are not asking, nor have we ever asked for anything that isn't ours. We are not asking for anything over and above that which is available to, and is expected by every other member of the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We simply seek those precious things that were projected by the Jesus that Europeans introduced to our people: a sense of understanding, a capacity for compassion and a will for justice. From this will flow a fundamental acknowledgment that has for so long been denied of our people, a respect for our dignity as human beings.</PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to table that document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not one of us believed that this legislation did not involve deep questions of social justice, equity and certainty before the law. Whether this parliament has discharged its duty to examine this legislation in such a manner as to enhance the best interests of all Australians and not to do harm to the federal compact upon which the constitution is based, only time will tell. Whether we have done so in such a manner as to advance not only the social but also the economic wellbeing of all Australians, only time will tell. I believed, and have always believed, that it was necessary to address these measures against the need for a reconciliation amongst all peoples in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one has a mortgage on morality in this place. As Senator Alston said, no-one has a mortgage on compassion in this place; no-one has a mortgage on social justice in this place. I believe all members of this parliament attempted, according to their own ideas about these principles, to address this measure in the best interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this parliament comes second place because it was the High Court that showed us the way. It was the Mabo No. 2 decision that showed us the way. That is really to the shame of the parliament. I stand here as a legislator. I do not agree that the laws of this country should be made by a court, whether it be the High Court or any other court. I believe we as the elected parliament should have had the foresight to see what needed to be done. We should have realised how the High Court was moving. In a celebrated 1983 case&mdash;which I prefer not to refer to at times, but I will do so on this occasion&mdash;Mr Justice Brennan had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approval of the proposed law for the amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was the constitutional amendment&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was an affirmation of the will of the Australian people that the odious policies of oppression and neglect of Aboriginal citizens were to be at an end, and that the primary object of power is beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA>In that same decision, Mr Justice Deane had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it became increasingly clear that Australia, as a nation, must be diminished until acceptable laws be enacted to mitigate the effect of past barbarism . . . </PARA>
<PARA>We should have realised how the High Court was moving. In fact, I suppose on a couple of occasions we attempted to do something about it. All honourable senators know that. But the parliament had to be almost dragged screaming to face reality because of a High Court decision. To me, that is shameful. To have acted sooner would have been the appropriate thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some speculation in sections of the press as to how I would vote on this matter. There has been speculation as to how I would vote on a number of matters. In the 18 years that I have been here I have said something about almost everything. All that members of the press or honourable senators need to do is look up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see what I have said. I remind the Senate, and anybody else who is interested, what I said on 23 August 1988 on the reconciliation motion that was proposed in the Senate at that time. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meeting in this new place, it is fitting that we acknowledge the fullness of human history in this land. This motion will stand as a statement of our commitment to national and individual reconciliation with the descendants of those who have suffered dispossession and dispersal in the wake of European and other settlement in 1788. Among those descendants I am proud to name one as my son-in-law.</PARA>
<PARA>Much has been said about reconciliation, but we have not seen a great deal of reconciliation amongst us during this debate. At times we did. I must congratulate a number of those senators&mdash;Senator Ellison, Senator Alston amongst others&mdash;who have asked detailed questions of Senator Gareth Evans. I do not always congratulate Senator Evans, but on this occasion I think he has done a vigorous and sterling job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In just a few minutes, we will be voting to give the Native Title Bill 1993 its third reading, thereby concluding what has been the longest debate on any bill in the history of the Australian parliament. The previous record holder&mdash;not entirely coincidentally&mdash;was the 1989 ATSIC bill, which had a total of 39 hours and 5 minutes of debate. We passed that milestone around 9 o'clock this morning just after we began.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the record, we spent 10 hours and 21 minutes on the second reading. According to my calculations, we spent 38 hours and 45 minutes on the committee stage, for a total of just over 49 hours. The guillotine procedure&mdash;one might want to exclude that&mdash;took nearly two hours. The third reading will now take 45 minutes. That totals 51 hours and 45 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great many people have contributed to the outcome that has been achieved as a result of all this deliberation. I am delighted to see so many of them around the galleries tonight. First of all, there has been my ministerial colleagues. Leaving aside for the moment the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I want to mention Frank Walker, Michael Lavarch, Robert Tickner, Duncan Kerr, Warren Snowdon, Michael Lee, Simon Crean and, in this chamber, Bob McMullan, Bob Collins and Nick Bolkus. I also want to mention Barney Cooney and those other senators who played such an extraordinary and productive role in leading the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs through the inquiry that occurred last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank very warmly and very appreciatively the public servants who have contributed so much to this: Sandy Hollway, who lead the team, Robert Orr and Mike Dillon. They were the essential leaders of it. They gave me absolutely outstanding support over very many months of hard slog. They also gave me absolutely outstanding support in this chamber during the 38 hours and 45 minutes that I was on my feet in the committee stage debate. Without them, I would not have been anything like as half-way plausible as I might on many occasions have appeared to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is then the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander negotiators, who have been so absolutely crucial to crafting this legislative product. Many of them are in the gallery tonight, and I am delighted to see them: Lois O'Donoghue, the chairperson of ATSIC; Noel Pearson; Marcia Langton from the Cape York Land Council; David Ross from the Central Land Council; Darryl Pearce from the Northern Land Council; and from the Kimberley Land Council, Darryl Cronin and Peter Yu. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been the lawyers. The lawyers do not always get the gratitude, attention and the thanks they deserve, and rightly so. Ron Castan QC, after all, almost single-handedly set this whole affair going with his advocacy in the Mabo case. Kathy Whimp, who has been mentioned earlier tonight, has worked with the Democrats. I see that Father Frank Brennan is in the gallery. He has been a phenomenal contributor to the Aboriginal cause over so many years. All of them played an absolutely major role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to other parliamentary colleagues, I owe a great debt of gratitude to the Greens for finally coming aboard in the way they did. As readers of this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> may guess, it was not always as easy a relationship and as easy an outcome as some on the other side seem to assume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank Cheryl Kernot. She is right in saying that she, through her leadership of the Australian Democrats, contributed to this result. It was not an ordinary, run of the mill, routine political contribution from Cheryl Kernot as leader of the Democrats. Throughout, it was an outstandingly constructive and thoughtful one from someone genuinely committed to the public interest and not just to political point scoring. That is something I very much appreciate in this place; we do not see enough of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one politician whose contribution to this whole exercise gigantically exceeds that of everyone else, and I make no partisan point when I say that is the Prime Minister, Paul Keating. It was Paul Keating who saw, starkly and clearly, the huge issue of principle, of social justice and basic human decency that was involved in the Mabo case. It was Paul Keating who saw that we were diminished&mdash;to use the phrase that Senator Harradine quoted from the courts&mdash;by that whole unhappy history. It was Paul Keating who saw the opportunity for a process of national reconciliation by consolidating and implementing into Australian law the Mabo legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the Prime Minister who drove the process of consultation that occurred so relentlessly over the last 12 months through endless meetings at an endless series of locations with an endless number of groups and individuals. It was Paul Keating, as Prime Minister, who immersed himself in the detail of this legislative exercise to a greater extent than any Prime Minister has ever done on any single issue of which I am aware&mdash;certainly, that I have ever witnessed. It was Paul Keating who was not deterred by the cynicism, scepticism, ribaldry, hostility and indifference expressed by so many people on so many occasions about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister drove this process and by his leadership he produced a bill which, despite all its complexity, has four simple, clean themes running through it, which still emerge, after all this process, as starkly, as cleanly, as simply and as compellingly as they did on the first day they were conceived. They are the themes of: ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; provision for clear and certain validation of past acts, including grants and laws if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title; a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts of native title; and rigorous, specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants out of native title land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Prime Minister Keating can be very proud of his achievement. It is an historic one. It is an enormous, landmark achievement for a cause which he made very much his own, and one for which, I believe, he and his government will be remembered for generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, this is a landmark achievement, and one that I hope will also be recognised as such, and very proudly so, by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people here in this gallery and across this country. We do owe our indigenous peoples, our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander fellow Australians, a huge debt for the destruction and dispossession that we non-Aboriginal Australians wreaked for over 200 years of Australian history. I hope that, by passage of this legislation tonight, we have repaid just a little of that debt. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was more than a little disappointing that this has happened right at the very end of the process, when we had a signed undertaking from the minister. We were looking at a new deal for farm families. We were looking at an increase in the amount so that there would be no loss. Indeed, we were looking at an increase of over $4 a week to make up the amount that moving from Austudy back to the additional family payment would have meant to families as well as a guardianship allowance and rent assistance available for single parents. The only reason given to me was that, apparently when the government had redone its sums, it found that sufficient savings were not going to be made. Therefore, we have no amendments before us tonight. The reason we delayed was that we were hoping that some amendments would be made. We need now to proceed quickly. The Democrats will be supporting the move to make sure that 16-year-olds stay in Austudy. In other words, we will be supporting the status quo.</PARA></TALK.START>

We do not have an amendment; we are opposing the clauses. I am quite sad that the gallery is empty because if it were not, the members of the public who were here clapping this government would hear exactly what had happened to the Democrats.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating these clauses on what is still Thursday  in this Alice in Wonderland world&mdash;it is really 10 past 12 on Wednesday morning outside this place. This matter could have been debated when we were debating the whole bill. But, no, it was deferred. Why was it deferred? Senator Kernot talked to the gallery tonight about the new age of consultation. She said to the coalition, `What you need to do is be part of this new consultation process and you can negotiate and debate with us'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees has been stung badly by that new consultation process. I can understand why she feels angry. I feel angry on her behalf. She got a written agreement. She came to me and she said, `Here, I've got this written signed agreement'. I was reasonable. I said, `If that's the case and you want to move some amendments relating to that or if the government says it's going to move some amendments, we'll defer that item'. We deferred it. But what happened? The government did the dirty on her, frankly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we were going to oppose the amendment if the government brought it in, was that we were concerned that we did not know in detail who the winners and losers would be and we also did not know what the costing would be. I was going to ask in the committee stage debate on that amendment what the details were of the breakdowns of the costings. Obviously, the government had not done that before it did the deal with Senator Lees, because when the government went and did it, it backed out on her. The people in the gallery were clapping this government only a few minutes ago for some deals that were done on amendments. Suddenly we find another deal that was done, and the government backed out of it. I feel that is not the way to do business in this place&mdash;to sign an agreement telling somebody that you will move amendments and then pull out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Senator Lees has learnt her lesson. That is not the way we do business with the Democrats. We like to debate here in the chamber and have it out in the open, which is where the debate should be going on, not outside in the back rooms, which was what was going on. Clause 2 was brought in here and I did not know what was going on. It made me look like a bit of a goose. I did not know what was going on because there was a little deal being done between the Democrats and the government; a written, signed statement was being cooked up. It fell through. I am not the goose. There are a number of geese around this place and I do not happen to be one of them. I think it is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 88 and 89 would save the government about $27 million a year when fully implemented and would make about 75 per cent of people worse off than if the present system of Austudy for eligible 16-year-olds were kept in place. This is because of lower income and asset test thresholds that apply to family payment. This is another measure&mdash;and I am sorry the people in the gallery have gone&mdash;that the Australian public was not told about before the last election. It is another underhand measure that the government did not foreshadow. But we have got used to that. In fact, almost everything that I have got up and spoken on on social security in the last half of this session has been things that the government did not tell the public about, unless it was good news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have constantly had these tightening of measures, but when we said we were going to tighten things, we were the baddies; we were the ones who did not care about people, just as the government tried to portray tonight. I found the suggestion that I do not care about justice for Aborigines totally offensive. We have more Aborigines dying in childbirth now than we had in 1973. Senator Gareth Evans stood here pontificating about what happened tonight&mdash;Aborigines have an incredible incidence of diabetes, they are glue sniffing and alcoholism takes their lives at a very early age, and the government talks to me about justice. It is just unbelievable. Those opposite did the same thing during the election campaign&mdash;the coalition did not care. I find that offensive too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cared enough to tell the Australian public the truth, and we will live by that. I do not have any concern that we told the truth. Maybe we are not on that side of the chamber, but we did not lie our way into government&mdash;we told the truth. The Democrats might find when we are in government after the next election that we will tell the truth and we will not do deals, as has happened tonight, and pull out on them. We will be straight. The Democrats got done, just like the public got done at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure would be particularly hard on low to middle income families. For example, a family with an income of $27,000 and one dependent child would lose over $52 a fortnight. The measure is regressive and it also would have a particularly harsh impact on rural families. The government's rationale for the change is that there has been an increase in school retention rates so it is no longer considered appropriate to provide Austudy to 16-year-old students. But it must be remembered that much of this increased retention rate is due to the adverse employment climate for young people under this government's policies, particularly young people in regional and rural areas where we see unemployment amongst young people at astronomical levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes, as I do, to regional Victoria, one will see the numbers of young people who are desperate to get jobs and their families who are desperate because they have not got jobs. Many of these people are staying on at school. The government argues about its increased retention rate. Much of that is to do with the fact that young people cannot find employment. We will not be supporting these two clauses. I believe the Democrats will be supporting us on this. I say again that they got diddled, just like the Australian public, because they were not told about this measure that the government was going to bring in after the election. </PARA>

That person said he could not continue to negotiate any further with me because he had just received a call from the opposition, which might offer him a better deal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I accept that Senator Lees has entered into these discussions on the social security legislation in good faith and with integrity. I regret that we cannot proceed with the arrangement we entered into. I reject the implication of some of Senator Patterson's assertions that we `did the dirty' and `diddled' on the deal. The discussions on the agreement were entered into in good faith. It is very common to have quite lengthy discussions on a variety of matters in this place. That is not unusual. I do not think anything in particular is wrong with that at all. Indeed, the very nature of this place is designed to encourage that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposed in the budget the measure that we are considering tonight in order to bring the arrangements for 16-year-old secondary students more in line with the conditions applying to younger children in the family payments system. These conditions include payment to the mother; continued access as appropriate to guardians allowance; rent assistance; the home child-care allowance; and a tighter income and assets test, with a reduced poverty trap problem, where a number of children are present. We have sought to negotiate the outcome with both the opposition and the minor parties, but we have been unable to come to a satisfactory solution on the arrangements that protect the bulk of the budgetary savings, which are estimated to be $24.6 million in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) was prepared to meet some of the concerns expressed about this measure, such as the reduction in the maximum rate of payment comparable to Austudy and the distinction between 16- and 17-year-olds. However, I am advised that the opposition parties pressed further amendments. Those amendments largely erode any of the budget savings that we have anticipated. While not objecting to those amendments in principle&mdash;I understand but do not agree with the proposals of the opposition and the Democrats&mdash;the minister has decided that that approach must be considered in the budget context. As a consequence, both the initial proposal and the other issues that have been raised in the negotiations will be reconsidered in the forthcoming budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that on Saturday the Minister for Social Security came to an arrangement with the Democrats that would allow a modified version of this proposal to proceed. However, the subsequent 72 hours have given us a chance to look very closely at the costings and it appears that they are to the disadvantage of the budgetary process and that is why we have deferred it to the incoming budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the committee does not insist upon its amendment disagreed to by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the hour of the day, I make a few brief points in speaking to the motion. This bill, as I explained to the Senate during its original consideration in this chamber, contains three amendments which were introduced to align the Veterans' Entitlements Act with similar provisions contained in the Social Security Act. It also contains a fourth proposal which is the extensions of the veterans' children education scheme benefits to children of extreme disablement adjustment veterans. This was a budget measure this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of concern to the Senate, and in particular to the opposition, and the reason for this bill being amended originally&mdash;an amendment which the House of Representatives failed to agree to&mdash;arose in the area of that part of the bill dealing with allocated pensions. The opposition proposal to exclude allocated pensions and allocated annuities from the managed investment rules and the Veterans' Entitlements Act will prevent the equitable income and asset assessment of these investments compared with other forms of managed investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allocated pensions and allocated annuities have the characteristics of managed investments without the constraints normally associated with a superannuation fund. For example, a superannuation fund provides fixed payments over a person's lifetime, and there is no redeemable asset. Unlike a person with a superannuation investment, a person with an allocated pension has the discretion to withdraw all or part of the investment at any time. People who invest in an allocated pension or allocated annuity should not be treated more beneficially than those who invest in other managed investments. That would reduce the equity of the service pension income and assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners with the same means and financial resources available to them should have the same amount of income and assets assessed for service pension purposes. It is a principle of the income test that ongoing gains are treated as income for all investments that can be readily realised and utilised by the pensioners for their support. There is no reason why allocated pensions and allocated annuities should be excluded and given privileged treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failure to pass this bill will mean that the Department of Veterans' Affairs will be maintaining inconsistent pension assessment rules to those applied under the Social Security Act. This may lead, I think, to confusion amongst the pensioner population. The independent review of the income and assets test for service pensions and social security pensions will be a broad review, taking into account the assessment of allocated pensions and allocated annuities. The reference group that the consultant will be seeking comments from will include a person who represents the interests of the ex-service community, and that person has now been appointed to the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, the proposed amendment will be consistent with the Social Security Act and will be an interim measure until the government can consider and implement the findings of this review. I think it is appropriate just to address some of the misconceptions around this issue. I do not want to spend too long speaking to this motion because it is late and I appreciate that most senators want to go home for Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment of managed investments is not a costly or labour intensive data collection for pensioners or the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is no requirement for pensioners to research the performance data of their investments. Most information is obtained from an independent expert research house and the information is simultaneously and automatically updated on the database of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, there will be inequities between the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Social Security Act in the assessment of overseas shares, allocated pensions, allocated annuities and the availability of advance pharmaceutical allowance. That clearly and simply is the consequence of failure to support this motion. Failure to change the definition of `shares' and `listed securities' can encourage pensioners to invest in the overseas share market in preference to the Australian one. I accept that it appears at last we won that particular issue in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about the impact that failure to pass this bill will have on the veterans' children education scheme because an estimated 32 grants for payments under that scheme will not be made to the children of extreme disablement adjustment veterans. As from 1 January next year, no further payments of advance pharmaceutical allowance will be made. That is, again, going to be the impact of the failure of this committee to support this provision. It will affect those veterans and war widows, those service pensioners, who can least afford this measure because the advance payment is available to chronically ill pensioners with a high volume of prescription drug use. Only service pensioners who have less than $20 per fortnight ordinary income can access the advance payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having seen the opposition run this argument around the track in the last week or so in this chamber&mdash;the government's position on this is clear&mdash;I believe it is now time for us to pass this bill and get on with the job. Failure to support this motion will mean that a number of disadvantaged veterans and war widows will unnecessarily suffer. I hope that is not the position that the opposition will adopt. If it does, it will stand condemned by the veteran community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be voting against this motion. Unlike the minister, I do not intend to take eight minutes rerunning the second reading debate and going through the details of the bill; that is all in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, where I lucidly put the opposition's point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not prepared to support this motion. We have a number of reasons for not doing so and the reasons have not changed since the bill was introduced in the Senate. The parliament has two review bodies set up at present and until those two committees have investigated the matter of retirement incomes, reported to the parliament and the government has thought about those reports and come up with a coherent and complete retirement incomes policy, we are not prepared to tinker with any retirement incomes policy proposals that come before this parliament whether in the portfolio of veterans' affairs or social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason that we are opposing it, apart from the parliamentary committees, is a real concern for the welfare of the veterans' community. This government really is quite out of touch with the people it is governing; it is quite impersonal. The government does not seem to realise&mdash;I suppose since it has little personal contact&mdash;that change is anathema to the elderly; they just simply cannot cope with change and unpredictability. It worries them enormously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a fair bit to do with elderly people in my life before I came in here. I still have contact with people in their 70s, 80s and 90s. The one thing they cannot cope with is unpredictability and change. They get enormously distressed about it. It does not matter what their financial resources are. Even the very wealthy get very insecure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about is the veteran community. The great majority of the veteran community is made up of veterans of the Second World War. Well over half the veterans dealt with by the Department of Veterans' Affairs come from the Second World War. All those people are now running well into their 70s. They are at a time of life when their health is declining rapidly. They have got all the uncertainties and feelings of insecurity that come with advancing years that I talked about a few minutes ago that are an inseparable part of ageing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These natural fears to which that age group is subject to are being exacerbated by the continual change that is imposed upon them by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I suppose it would not be so bad if the changes were predictable and reasonable, but so much that comes out of this government is ad hoc. That makes the effect of the changes all the greater. The government is going around telling these pensioners to provide for themselves and at the same time it is introducing legislative procedures that hinder the ability of pensioners to provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just give the committee an example of the great inequity, not to say the iniquity, that we have of the notional capital gains tax on investments. The position adopted by the government is that if the value of investments has risen, even though those investments are not sold and the profit realised, there is a reduction made in the pension going to a beneficiary under the pension scheme. What is the justice in that? They are no better off financially. They have not got the money in their hands. Yet they have taken a cut in their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This appreciation is often quite illusory because a lot of these investments made by pensioners were made over 10 years ago at a time when values on the stock market were considerably higher than they have been for the last 12 or 18 months. They have taken a real beating with respect to the face value of their investment. Since the stock market has moved up considerably in the last 12 months, there has been a notional improvement in their position, but in many cases the value of their investment still has not equalled what they paid for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to go into the technicalities of the bill. Suffice it to say that we will not be supporting it for those reasons of justice and fairness. There is no secret about our position. We made it clear quite a long while ago. In no sense has the government been ambushed. I must say that for the government to have got itself into the mess that it is in over this legislation is a little surprising. I would have thought that any intelligent government would have appreciated both our position and the position of the Democrats and that it would have planned and accommodated our points of view and not crashed forward into the battlements in the way it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would just like to say something about the reply that has come from the House of Representatives. Nothing in the government's reasons for this request would in any way persuade the Senate to change its point of view. I read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and I saw parts of the broadcast of the debate in between divisions. I would have to say that Dr Theophanous really showed his lack of interest, not to say his contempt, for veterans in the way he handled his part of the conduct of the bill in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final nonsense was the committee of reasons that was set up. That was just a farce because the House of Representatives got an instant report from the committee. In other words, no consideration of the bill was given when it came down amended from the Senate. The government had made up its mind before the bill had been introduced into the House of Representatives. It had appointed a committee and it had actually written the committee report before the bill was presented in the House of Representatives. That is a contemptible act. If people read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> they will see that what happened was that the bill came in; Dr Theophanous made his fatuous comments about veterans not deserving anything better than pensioners; he immediately set up a committee; and then, within 30 seconds, the committee had reported without having met or even left the chamber. Needless to say, the reasons attributed in the committee's report are as worthless as the process that it followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue that I want to deal with relates to the rather limp excuses from the minister that all sorts of terrible things are going to happen if this bill does not go through. Yes, there is now a difference between the provisions for veterans' affairs and the provisions for social security&mdash;but it is well within the government's power to accommodate that. The solution is not to create another wrong by amending the Veterans' Entitlements Act as is proposed. The correct approach for the government&mdash;and an intelligent government would not have any difficulty in seeing this at all&mdash;is to modify the social security legislation so that it is parallel with the veterans' affairs legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be blackmailed by the government with all these bleatings about veterans and educational grants and the rest of it. Again, it is quite possible for the government to introduce a bill to correct that or, even simpler still, for the government just to accept the bill, as amended by this place, in the House of Representatives tomorrow morning. If that happens, no-one will suffer at all. That is the commonsense and fair thing for the government to do. On the basis of equity and fairness, we will not support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the committee does not insist upon its amendments Nos 2 to 18 disagreed by the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>The government wishes to persist with its position and resist the amendments previously passed by this place which were rejected by another place. The government is somewhat puzzled by the National Party of Australia, which sponsored these amendments, because it is usually a party of states rights and often says that centralised bureaucracies are not close enough to the needs of the people on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the government agrees that local decision making is more effective. This is the basis for these reforms. The country areas program money is of course secure. All that will change is that there will be increased flexibility to ensure that it goes to the young people it is meant to help. There is enough in the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill to allay the fears even of the Nationals&mdash;the party of states rights until this piece of legislation&mdash;who have said that, in this case, they do not trust their state colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accountability provisions of broadbanding are there to ensure that the money goes where it is intended to go and that it helps the country students whom it is intended to help. Broadbanding is intended to help students who are doubly disadvantaged by their isolation and disadvantage. As the opposition has said repeatedly, the country areas program is a good program. The government thinks so too. Its funding base in 1994 is secure and it will continue to provide school children with much needed education, social and cultural experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is always room for improvement in any program. In this case, the improvement should focus on public scrutiny and achieving educational outcomes for the students, rather than on cultural and social facilities for the whole community. The onus will now be on education authorities to achieve the stated objectives and to report to the parents and the community through equity agreements. This will make it much easier for the Australian public to assess whether the funds and the effort are being targeted in the most effective way.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, it will be open to public scrutiny as to whether it is worth while for students to be funded for holidays to New Zealand; or whether in country areas program funds should be used for floodlights for polo fields and swimming pools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we come to the question of better targeting, these provisions will allow the movement of funds between the disadvantaged schools program and the country areas program in either direction and achieve the exact opposite of what the opposition is claiming. Broadbanding allows teachers and parents to develop better programs for their students because it makes it possible for decisions to be made much closer to the school. It allows those who really know the disadvantages and needs of students to do more to address them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous to suggest, as the opposition has, that being poor and from a low socioeconomic background is exclusively an urban experience. Students from low socioeconomic backgrounds are found throughout the country, including in rural and isolated areas. However, the opposition would have us believe that those who are poor live in the city. In opposing this simple fact, the opposition is trying to stop us funding the educational needs of poor students in the country. These are the students most in need of our assistance. The opposition is trying to stop real and positive improvements for the students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of accountability, one important consequence of the broadbanding is that it will deliver the most progressive education agreements that the Commonwealth has ever had with states, territories and non-government authorities. These agreements, which will be public, commit all education authorities to stated goals and objectives and outcomes for each group of disadvantaged students. This is a major step forward for education in the country. The agreements also commit education authorities to account publicly for their progress in terms not just of the money spent but, more importantly, of what they achieve with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We make no apologies that these agreements require authorities to identify what resources they are putting into equity. The Commonwealth funds are supposed to be supplementary. We know that real improvements in the education of these students will require an effort from us all. Almost all the agreements are ready for signature after six months of detailed negotiations with the authorities, parents, teachers and interest groups. Some have already been signed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be little change of these agreements going ahead if broadbanding disappears. Broadbanding is the main incentive for systems to sign up for much greater public accountability. Broadbanding reflects the reality with which school systems have been grappling for some time that disadvantages such as poverty, Aboriginality and isolation often overlap. Resources have to be targeted properly to do anything really positive about these disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move to the second broad area of amendment as to whether non-government schools should have direct access to national equity program funds. The government is astounded that the independent sector is asking for such close ministerial involvement in its operations. It is much more common for it to be telling us to go away. Why has there been such a turnaround? The answer is obvious. It does not want to be accountable for the funds it receives. It does not want to take the equity seriously in its sector. This should not be acceptable to anyone on either side of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the national equity program was being developed, the independent sector put up a strong fight to get its own funding allocation. The argument those in that sector used was that they were big people now and they wanted to be able to run their own programs in a way that best suited their own students and their own style of operation. So the government identified the independent sector's allocation across all equity funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independent sector in each state and territory now has its own allocation of students with disabilities, students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, rural and isolated students, non-English speaking background students and students at risk. They have the power to organise themselves in the best way to allocate and deliver those funds. This puts them on the same footing as the government and Catholic sectors. This is only fair and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last year, when the funds for the students at risk program were extended to the non-government sector, the independents were furious when the government suggested that their funds would be best administered from a national pool. They would not have a bar of it. They insisted on each state and territory getting its own allocation and administering it through the Association of Independent Schools. We are intending nothing more or less for the rest of the equity program. They obviously cannot make up their minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The equity implications of allowing non-government schools to apply for funds and run programs on their own are very serious. It will not be possible to allocate the funds to an independent sector in a state and then calculate what amount to retain in Canberra for those schools which may want to go it alone. For example, how would it be possible to assess whether these schools are more or less needy than those receiving funding from aggregation? The answer is that it would not be possible to do this in a way which is fair and equitable. The only way in which the government will be able to handle the complicated backflip by the independent sector is to put all equity funding back to Canberra and administer it from there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will cost a lot in administrative resources, and that will have to be met from the independent sector's share of the funds. It would also cost time and be less effective. The only way in which these funds could be distributed equitably is by the Commonwealth establishing a national independent equity authority. This body would be appointed by the minister to advise on allocating all the independent sector's equity funds according to national priority and national criteria. Is that what the independent sector really wants? If the government is required to deal with the independent schools on a one-to-one basis, that is surely what they are going to get. We do not particularly want that, they do not want it, and their students certainly deserve better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has given a speech prepared by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) and, no doubt, his officers, but it still completely misses the point. It appears that this good minister, Senator Ray, has been set up.

It was just a pat, schoolboy tactic from some officers assisting the responsible minister in the other place, giving the Senate minister some words which do not meet the arguments of the debate in this chamber. I reject the arguments made just now by the minister, Senator Ray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to honourable senators in the chamber to recall the several hours of debate we had on the education bills and I remind them of the reasons we had for rejecting these clauses in the bills. All of those reasons still stand. They have not been answered, either by the speech from the minister just now or, more particularly, by minister Free in the House of Representatives debate on the Senate amendments&mdash;and I have carefully read the speech of 18 December in the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at page 4466. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to repeat all the arguments put earlier; they are all in the record. I endorse everything that I said on behalf of the opposition in the earlier debate and I still accept the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on each of these matters. I believe that the minister has not addressed the findings of that committee at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the speech that he was asked to deliver here, Senator Ray appealed to a number of very noble aspirations, such as: assisting those in need; ensuring that local knowledge and local decision making is maximised; ensuring flexibility; and ensuring that no caricature arises by saying that all disadvantaged schools are in urban not country areas. The government should be made well aware that we support the principles to which the minister appealed in his speech, but those principles are straw men when we analyse the logic, or lack of logic, of connecting them with these amendments. That is why the opposition completely rejects the motion before the committee and insist upon our amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Mr Free's speech, he is caricaturing what we said, and particularly what I said. He refers to me in most paragraphs of the speech that he gave in the other place. He takes up the statements I made in this place, but in a way that actually distorts them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the responsible minister, Mr Free, had understood what was said in the Senate and given a constructive reply&mdash;even if he outlined some unintended consequence or pointed out something that we did not know at the time of our debate&mdash;with the flexibility we have in the Senate we could have responded to that; and even changed our minds. I put it to honourable senators that we ought not change our minds because all we have got back is a slanging match. It is a caricature of what was said here and an appeal to good principles&mdash;but without the logic of honing them back to the measures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to two points in the letter written by Mr Crimmins and his fellow authors that relate to this bill. The first deals with our major amendment. It has been accepted not only in the Senate but also in the House of Representatives. So honourable senators will note when they read these letters in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that the first part of the letter relates to that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter is in great contrast to what Senator Schacht said. It says that what Senator Schacht was saying about small Christian schools is not true. Can we trust ministers who make claims like this, presumably prompted by advisers? When such a speech comes to the attention of the schools concerned they write refuting what the minister has said about them. One of the paragraphs of the letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Schacht said in the Senate that "other smaller Christian school organisations also support the proposal" (Thursday 16 December). We do not support any amendments that would tighten or strengthen the New Schools Policy. That we might find some provision in this Policy more objectionable than others should not be taken to mean that we support any elements.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the minister was wrong about this and the National Council of Independent Schools Association. Immediately following the debate on these bills in this chamber I was an invited guest of the council which was having a meeting in Canberra. I went to that council meeting and it said that what I had been saying on behalf of the opposition was endorsed by the council. The council is concerned that as representatives of independent schools they not be misunderstood by the Senate. It is to the shame of the then minister Senator Schacht that he got it so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the letter from the Australian Association of Christian Schools goes on to say that it wishes the minister to retain the ability to make decisions with regard to the national equity program for schools. The reason for this is not some new found wish of independent schools in the states to give a blessing to centralism in Canberra, but that they do not wish this Labor government to force them to be systemic. They are independent, individual schools that come together as an association for various purposes. But in terms of their funding they do not wish to be forced to be systemic, to have the minister give moneys to assist them in the states; and for that system to then determine the priorities of funding with regard to individual schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These schools want to have accountability of the government. They want the minister to be able to give reasons why the priorities were determined in the way that they were. All they are asking for is the status quo. It has operated like this for years.

For some reason, he did a backflip on this. I do not know his reasons for that; he will probably get up and tell us in a minute.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to having a look at what the arguments were on this matter. There was a review of CAP back in 1990. In view of the widespread success of CAP which has to date promoted positive attitudes towards schooling and in light of new demands being placed on rural schools, funding should be increased to this program. There has been evidence that it is one of the most successful education programs ever developed. As I said in an earlier speech, `If it ain't broke then don't fix it' is a very good principle of government. That is the evidence from around the country. Everyone involved said it worked well. It involved the whole community. It involved getting the state schools and the private schools working together.

<PARA>We have to realise that the isolated areas of Australia cover only one per cent of Australia's population. They do not have many resources. If we drain that sort of money away from isolated schools, it will make an extremely big difference to the sorts of things these schools are doing. I am not talking about silly examples like floodlights. I am talking about the vast bulk of things that happen in these schools&mdash;things like musical instruments and cooperative programs that are developed with other schools. These sorts of things are being threatened even under the current legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation underlines in a very heavy way that government can move money about between these programs. In the cities we have people who have advocates. They have the ability to put their views to government. They often have offices very near government and they can have their voices heard. People out in the isolated areas cannot. They do not have the advocacy for their cause that these other programs have. So the louder voices will be heard and money will be moved in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts has told me that the government has said, `Money can move in the other direction too'. I concede that that is possible under this proposal. The evidence before us in that letter that I incorporated and other evidence that we received on the committee shows that that is not the likely case. It is likely to drain out of country areas. I appeal to the Greens to change their minds and hold to their original position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of new argument to attempt to convince the Democrats to change really shows that this whole area has reached the stage where the legislation that is proposed by the government with regard to PCAP is correct and the legislation proposed by the government with regard to the equity programs for independent schools does not satisfy the test of being workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the equity programs for independent schools, the evidence that was given by Senator Tierney, which was new evidence, reinforced the position that the coalition took.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the argument we heard often referred to religion and schools based on religion. It is a fact that a great number of schools are independent of the government system and the religious system. These schools are based on a philosophical approach; they are an alternative to that which exists in tradition. I speak of schools such as neighbourhood cottage schools and Rudolph Steiner schools.

I think Senator Tierney is condemned by his own evidence: the situation as we know it now does not and has no capacity to guarantee that the money which deserves to be spent on the worthy PCAP programs will not drain away. The Commonwealth government at the moment meets the submissions and the states contribute little, if any. At the moment, the capacity of the Commonwealth government to restrain or constrain what happens from then on is minimal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that those who are interested in this matter would have read the report that was put out by DEET in 1992 under the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Act, entitled `Report on financial assistance granted to each State in respect of 1991'. That report indicated how much money had been allocated by the department to the prescribed country areas and the success that had been met. There was certainly no questioning in the report of the value of such programs and the desirability of their continuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my previous contribution, I indicated that the purpose of the agreements between the state education authorities, et cetera, was to ensure that the states were committed to the continuation of the PCAP, as we know it. So to represent it in any other way is very misleading. There was earlier reference to a straw man. I think the ultimate in straw men was the one that the PCAP would be immediately threatened by this. The hyperbole on betraying CAPs that has been put about should really be recognised for what it is. As far as I am concerned, it is offensive to suggest what we are doing is a betrayal.

I am mindful of what has happened over the last week, and I suspect the best way of showing our thanks would be to end proceedings as quickly as possible so people can get on with their Christmas preparations. Therefore I will be very brief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record a vote of thanks to a number of people, including the hardworking staff of the Senate from the Clerk down who have performed exceptionally under difficult circumstances to keep the chamber operating. We should not forget that a lot of them do not go home when we rise and must be here well before we sit. It is frightening to think of the hours that they have put in over the last few weeks.</PARA>

A special thanks must go to the Transport Office&mdash;the people who have been here almost constantly since last week making, cancelling, and rearranging air bookings, and generally trying to anticipate what the Senate might do. The catering staff were faced with a similar problem and responded appropriately, as they have throughout the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my thanks to all honourable senators in this place for the cooperation I have received throughout the year.

We have developed a close working relationship which I think has come as a surprise to some people on my side, as well as some on his side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside I must comment on question time which has become easier on the Chair but, since the time limit was introduced, the number of questions asked are almost identical to last year, which proves that senators are very adaptable.

We have dealt with landmark legislation&mdash;not only the Native Title Bill but also the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which will have a big impact on this place. It ought to encourage an understanding of the importance of this place, although we sometimes trivialise it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wrestled this year with a budget that created unprecedented political and procedural problems for us. As a result, it has led to nothing less than a revolution in budget process. We have new estimates procedures and all sorts of things are changing around us. I know, for some people, that is extremely difficult to accommodate; but you ought to appreciate the significance of what has been going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that we have sat for a total of more than 415 hours this session, passed 110 bills and considered some 406 amendments&mdash;230 of which were involved in the events of the last four days. As we are all aware, this sitting will mark the end of the traditional autumn and budget patterns of sitting, with the adoption of a quite radical new approach to the management of legislation. I think the move to three sittings a year and the general practice we hope to implement of introduction in one session and legislation the next ought, rationally, to provide for a rather more manageable environment than we have had in the past. I certainly hope so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very difficult and tiring sitting and I think it is about time that we did focus, once and for all, on reforming and changing our practice and sitting hours and really give some sensible consideration to the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I hope that will be possible as a priority item next year. Saner working hours will benefit not only us, as senators, but also the staff of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Saner working hours will obviously benefit the staff of this place who support us so well through these kind of crazy sitting hours.

The convention is that we do not mention you by name, only as collectivities. But, for many of us, you are more than a collectivity; you are individuals. We appreciate the role you play, and it is time at least once a year&mdash;even at 2 o'clock in the morning&mdash;to say so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make special mention of one particular retiring attendant. Freddie Blake retired in November after 25 years of service&mdash;God bless him&mdash;as an attendant in the Senate.

We could have used a bit more of Freddie's Santa spirit in this chamber over the last few days. </PARA>

He had the nerve to come in here tonight and start talking about reforming the sitting hours in this place after last night and the last few weeks. He also had the nerve to talk about the great achievements of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill when we saw the way in which the staff of this place have been treated in the last few weeks, and last night in particular, by this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am in the mood, I will mention you, Mr President. You blamed the problems with question time on supplementary questions.

In that way, we might also solve that problem. </PARA>

I do not really want to press the point, but the circumstances in which they have had to work in the last few weeks have really been totally intolerable. They have done it with grace and patience because I think they believe in the process of this parliament and the importance of the Senate. We very seriously thank them for that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a session during which there has been major legislative process. The budget process was a difficult one; the IR bill was difficult; and Mabo was difficult, particularly for those who happened to be, for the time being, in the minority in this place. But I want to put on the record my appreciation for my colleagues. Though we might be in the minority, one can only say that they took it up to the majority&mdash;the new family.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The question of sovereign rights over the area known as Macedonia is a long-running and complex one reflecting the intricacies of various rivalries, conflicts and tensions which have taken place in the Balkans. The "Macedonia" in question that existed before the 1912-1913 Balkan wars was an Ottoman Province with a heterogeneous population, and with Slavs probably comprising the largest single element. The 51 per cent acquired by Greece, ie Aegean Macedonia, was ceded to it in the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest: (a) The term "Macedonian people" is subject to very wide interpretation by the countries and communities of the region. The Greek Government regards the Macedonian people as people from the region of Macedonia in Northern Greece. The Greek authorities deny that these people are systematically detained and, moreover, that the question of assimilation is not relevant as they do not recognise the existence of a "Macedonian minority". The only minority that Greece formally recognises is a "Muslim minority". (b) Freedom of speech and of the press is provided for in the Greek constitution, and is respected in practice, but there are notable exceptions. Greek law prohibits "exposing the friendly relations of the Greek state with foreign states to danger of disturbance," "spreading false information and rumours liable to create concern and fear among citizens and cause disturbance in the country's international relations" and "inciting citizens into rivalry and division, leading to disturbance of the peace". This law has been enforced on a number of occasions with respect to Macedonian issues. Organisations of Greek citizens of Slavic (Macedonian) origin are not allowed to use the word "Macedonian" in their names. Open performances of Slavic dances and the speaking of the Slavic language have also been discouraged. Education in Greece is carried out in the Greek language with the exception of that relating to the "Muslim Minority" which have the right to Turkish language education. (c) The Australian Government monitors the human rights situation in Greece through the Australian Embassy in Athens and has made representations to the Greek Government about individual cases of human rights concern including about Greek citizens of Macedonian origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) and (3)  The Australian Government's assessment of the human rights situation in Greece is in general accordance with that put forward by reputable human rights non-government organisations such as Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch. As stated above, the Australian Government has made representations to the Greek authorities on individual cases of human rights concern. Moreover, the Australian Government would anticipate that the Greek Government would take note of representations made by Australia or other members of the international community concerning allegations that Greece was in breach of its international human rights obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As to the 20 cases of ethnic Macedonians being charged through the Greek legal system for having expressed opinions that differ from those of the Greek Government referred to in the Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch reports, the Australian Government has been aware of a number of cases and has made specific representations in relation to Mr Sideropoulos and Mr Bulis. The Australian Embassy in Athens has been following their cases closely. Mr Sideropoulos's case has been raised with the Greek Foreign Minister. The information gathered on these cases by the Embassy is consistent with the Helsinki Watch and Amnesty International Reports. The latest information we have on their situation is that the two men were convicted on 1 April 1993 and sentenced to five months' imprisonment. However, these sentences were suspended on appeal and they were released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There is no indication of international support for raising the issue of Greece's "Macedonian minority" in international human rights forums. The Australian Government will, however, continue to monitor the situation and, as appropriate, make representations to the Greek Government on issues of concern.</PARA>
