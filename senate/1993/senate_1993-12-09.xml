<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in reply to your letter dated 21 October 1993 regarding the Migration (1993) Regulations Amendment, Statutory Rules 1993 No 235, which was considered by your Committee on 21 October 1993. Your reference is cttee\511.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You stated that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"the new Part 774 (designated persons (spouse)(temporary)) entry permit expressly excludes a de facto relationship from the definition of marital relationship for the purposes of that Part. The Committee would appreciate the reasons for this exclusion and for your advice on whether the exclusion could be considered a breach of personal rights.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context, the Committee noted that the principal Regulations define marital relationship to include a de facto relationship."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The background to this regulation is that I decided it was necessary to provide a special concession for people in custody pursuant to Division 4B of the Migration Act to be able to apply for an entry permit if they were the de jure spouse of an Australian citizen or permanent resident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing the regulation my Department consulted with the Attorney-General's Department on the question whether Commonwealth law requires the extension of any benefits being given to a de jure spouse to a defacto spouse. The advice of the Attorney-General's Department was that there is no such legal requirement, it is a matter for policy consideration in relation to each relevant provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"De facto spouse" is defined in regulation 1.3 to have the meaning set out in regulation 1.6. Subregulation 1.6 (1) provides that at the time of the relevant application the persons must be living together as spouses in a genuine domestic relationship that has continued for the period of 6 months or a lesser period specified in subregulation (2). The Committee will note that the provisions of subregulation 1.6(2) require that the Minister is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances affecting the persons to whom the particular application extends and there are compelling reasons for specifying that lesser period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for an applicant in detention to establish a de facto relationship with a person not in detention. As a result of the foregoing, and to ensure there could be no doubt as to the Government's policy intention, a decision was taken to extend the concession in this class to a de jure marriage and not to a de facto relationship. I do not believe that the exclusion of a de facto relationship could be considered to be a breach of personal rights.</PARA>

The Explanatory Statement was based on advice provided by the OLD in May 1993 which relied on section 48(2) of the AIA. Following  further discussions  between  the  Department  and  the OLD, subsequent  advice  was  provided  to  the  Department which concluded that the negative amounts included in Determinations did not  disadvantage institutions to which the Determinations applied. The assurance that I gave to the Committee in my letter of 26 October, that no institution had been disadvantaged, was based on the latter OLD advice. An extract of the OLD advice dated 1 June 1993 is attached for your information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that you have moved a Notice of Motion in the Senate to disallow Determinations T65 and T68. I am advised that the effect of  disallowing these Determinations would be to provide some institutions with funds in advance of their proper entitlements under the HEFA and to disadvantage other institutions by taking away funds to which they were properly entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that the information that I have now provided to the Committee will satisfy its queries and allow the Notice of Motion in  the  Senate to be withdrawn. I previously advised you that officers from the Department are available to assist  the Committee with this matter should you consider it helpful.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Training Guarantee (Administration) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No. 252, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 28 October 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations authorise the Minister to make decisions about recognised alternative training levy schemes and recognition for persons covered by such schemes. New r.2CC(7) provides appropriately for AAT review of these direct decisions by the Minister. There could, however, be disputes of fact under the provisions of new rr.2CC(5) and (6), even though those provisions are not drafted as discretions. It would seem appropriate to provide for review of decisions made under these two provisions.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 28 October 1993 about the Training Guarantee (Administration) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No. 252, in which you raised concerns about the lack of review of decisions made under new subregulations 2CC (5) and (6). The following explanation is based on advice from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulations provide for the Minister to recognise a training scheme as a recognised alternative training levy scheme (RATLS). If a scheme is given RATLS status, the employer is not required to pay the training guarantee charge in respect of the employees receiving training under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 2CC (5) obliges the manager of a scheme to notify the Minister if, as a result of a change in circumstances, the scheme may have ceased to qualify for (RATLS) status or to comply with a condition in relation to the scheme. It is appropriate to require the scheme manager to give notice of any change that might affect the status of the scheme, because the occurrence of a change is something peculiarly within the manager's knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 2CC (6) provides that if the manager of a scheme does not fulfil his or her obligation to notify the Minister of changed circumstances and, as a result of the change, the scheme ceases to qualify for RATLS status, then the scheme is taken to have ceased to be a recognised alternative training levy scheme when the change occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither subregulation 2CC (5) nor (6) confers power to make a decision that could be reviewed by the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subregulation 2CC (6) is designed to impose a sanction relevant to the scheme if the scheme manager does not comply with his or her obligation under subregulations 2CC (5). In effect, instead of providing a criminal penalty for failure to comply with subregulation (5), the penalty for the failure is a renewed liability to pay the training guarantee charge. The liability to pay the charge as a result of the operation of subregulation (6) can be avoided at any time merely by notifying the Minister that a change in circumstances has occurred. The Minister will consider the nature of the change and will either continue to recognise the scheme or will revoke the decision to recognise the scheme under subregulation (3). The decision to revoke is reviewable under subregulation (7).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is a change in circumstances that would disqualify the scheme, but the manager does not notify the Minister of the change, then subregulation 2CC (6) would operate so that the scheme would cease to have RATLS status at the time the change occurred. If, on becoming aware of the change, the Minister took the view that the scheme ceased to qualify for RATLS status, it would be appropriate for the Minister to revoke the relevant scheme decision under subregulation 2CC (3). The decision to revoke the scheme decision would then be reviewable under subregulation 2CC (7).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, as a result of the manager's failure to notify the Minister of the change in circumstances, the employer was required to pay the training guarantee charge, the employer could object to the assessment under section 53A of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990, which provides for objections to be made in the manner set out in Part IV of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would in any case remain open to the manager to notify the Minister in accordance with subregulation 2CC (5). As mentioned above, that would require the Minister to consider the matter, and any decision that was adverse to the employer would be reviewable under subregulation (7).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, for the reasons set out above, it is not appropriate to provide for any additional review of the effect of subregulations 2CC (5) and (6). Neither subregulation confers a power to make a reviewable decision. If the occurrence of the change has an adverse effect on the employer, there is adequate recourse under existing provisions of the regulations and Act. If the Minister revokes the scheme, the employer may appeal under subregulation (7) and, if a training guarantee charge becomes payable because the manager failed to give notice of a change, the employer may object under section 53A of the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust I have answered your concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Order No.M62/93 made under s.16H of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 28 October 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of New Exporters Allocation in paragraph 1.1 appears as drafted to subdelegate to the AMLC itself the power to vary the legislated quota of 10,000 tons without making a fresh instrument under the Act every time it does so. This would appear to be invalid. The Committee seeks your assurance that any variation of the quota from time to time will be made under s.16H of the parent Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 3.3 provides a discretion with the AMLC to vary a quota, expressed as "in its absolute discretion and without giving reasons". The Committee would be grateful for your assurance that this wide power is either subject to AAT review or comes within Administrative Review Council guidelines for exclusion from such review. It is unusual to provide for a discretion worded in such a way, particularly as there are no criteria to guide and limit its exercise. In addition, the express provision that reasons for decisions need not be given would appear to breach the rights of those affected. The Committee would appreciate your comments on this aspect of the provision.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 28 October 1993 concerning Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation (AMLC) Order No. M62/93 made under section 16H of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977 (AMLC Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 (Quotas Act) empowers the AMLC to establish quota schemes for the export of meat from Australia to particular countries where restrictions on exports of meat are, or in the opinion of the Corporation will be, imposed by the country concerned or by Australia. Under section 5 of the Quotas Act, the AMLC may by notice in writing given to exporters impose a limitation on the total quantity of meat that may be exported to the countries concerned. Allocations of quota to individual exporters are made by the Corporation under section 6 of the Quotas Act. Any variation to quota allocated to individual exporters is made under section 16X of the AMLC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme for the export of meat to the USA, which is the subject of the Order, has been established and administered by the Corporation in accordance with the Quotas Act and the AMLC Act. The Corporation set a limit on the total quantity of meat to be exported to the USA under section 5 of the Quotas Act and allocated quota to individual exporters under section 6 of the Quotas Act. The Order was issued by the Corporation under section 16H of the AMLC to, amongst other things, detail the obligations of exporters under the scheme and explain the mechanism for allocation of quota to individual exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In establishing the quota scheme, the Corporation set aside a quantity of 10,000 tonnes, the "New Exporters' Allocation". This quantity was to be allocated in accordance with the Order and was intended to give the opportunity for new exporters to enter the USA meat export trade. The New Exporters' Allocation formed part of the total limit specified in the notice under section 5 of the Quotas Act. Allocations of quota from the New Exporters' Allocation to individual new exporters were made under section 6 of the Quotas Act. Variations to individual new exporters' quotas were made under section 16X of the AMLC Act. As required by section 16W of the AMLC Act, the granting of quotas to individual new exporters was done in accordance with guidelines set out in the Corporation's corporate plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words "or such other amount as the Corporation may determine from time to time as constituting quota . . . which . . . is to be allocated to New Exporters" in the definition of "New Exporters' Allocation" in the Order were intended to recognise the Corporation's powers under the Quotas Act and the AMLC Act to determine the total quantity of meat that is to be exported to the USA and allocation of quotas to individual exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure you that the issue of quotas and variations to those quotas will at all times continue to be made in accordance with the AMLC Act, the Quotas Act and the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to your query on paragraph 3.3 of the order, l can assure you that all decisions made in respect of paragraph 3.3 are subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Applications may also be made for reasons for such decisions under section 28 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (AAT Act) and section 13 of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (ADJR Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMLC has assured me that there is no intention to limit or exclude in any way the jurisdiction of the AAT to review decisions made under the AMLC Act or the Quotas Act or to affect the rights of any person to seek reasons for decisions under the AAT Act or the ADJR Act.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have introduced the Native Title (Status Quo) Bill 1993 today to provide an opportunity for the parliament to legislate an effective interim means for the Commonwealth to deal with the concept of native title arising from the High Court decision in Mabo and others and Queensland 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last month has seen the parliament being faced with the unenviable decision to vote through the Native Title Bill 1993 while doubts remain over its effect and without allowing time for the bill to be given full scrutiny and greater public debate. There have been a number of arguments put for pushing ahead with the Government's answer to the Mabo case. Those advocating the swift passage of the bill say that any delay will see the collapse of the `fragile consensus' which has been built to support the legislation. May I state consensus is never fragile. Deals can be fragile but consensus is strong. They also argue that there is an urgent need to block the gross discriminatory Western Australian legislation that has already been made law. Anyone paying attention to the evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs would be aware of the enormous feeling of disempowerment and consternation throughout the community, but particularly amongst Aboriginal people throughout Australia. The lack of consultation and understanding at a `grassroots' level has led to the strong feeling of disempowerment. But this is also due to the complex nature and massive impact of the Native Title Bill 1993 on large numbers of Aboriginal and Islander people. The real fear of Western Australia's Lands (Titles and Traditional Usage) Act 1993 has caused many people to turn to the federal bill as a way of stopping Richard Court. The Keating Government has used this fear to its advantage and caused many people to be distracted from the detail of the federal bill and to rely on the Prime Minister, fine words in assessing the desirability of his legislation. Both Richard Court and the Prime Minister have used one another's legislation as a means of forcing through their respective Mabo responses. The government has already said that they will not support this piece of legislation. They may argue that it is unconstitutional and I shall come to that issue later. However, I believe that their motives are far less pure. They simply wish to rush through the legislation so that any time for real scrutiny and reflection is gone. So that they can get away with passing a piece of legislation which is discriminatory against Aboriginal people while the facade of justice remains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is more than happy to allow the fear generated over this issue to work in their favour. They simply want to use the quickest, simplest and least inconvenient way of acquitting themselves of finding justice for Aboriginal people. Meanwhile the Opposition is also unwilling to support the opportunity that this bill presents to properly assess the Native Title Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are urging us to support a select committee to enquire into and allow greater consultation on the federal bill, because they hope that any delay will see the government lose its bottle in the face of rising public opposition. For them it is a win&mdash;win situation. They win public support for opposing the legislation anyway and they win if a delay causes the bill to fail. In truth there is little in the Government's bill which they, in principle, would oppose. It is the political advantage which draws them to their position. This bill provides a real and valuable opportunity to take a deep breath and fully review the more comprehensive legislation which is before the Senate. It is the traditional role of this chamber to do that, yet neither the Government nor the Opposition is willing to abide by democratic principles and open the way for that to happen. It is being presented as a model of what the Federal Government could and should have done. It would have served to protect Aboriginal people from extinguishment of their barely recognised rights before they could enjoy access to any of them. It would have allowed time for a solid consensus to develop.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory Land Rights legislation lay on the table in the House of Representatives for three months before receiving bi-partisan support. It is an indictment of the current political climate that the legislation being proposed by the Government doesn't even come close to reaching the mark of that land rights legislation or gaining cross party support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill opens the way by converting the native title as recognised by the High Court in Mabo and Others and Queensland (1992) into the Statutory law of the Commonwealth and not allowing any law of the Commonwealth, State or Territory to extinguish or modify native title until this parliament provides otherwise. This is necessary because any State or Territory legislation passed after the 30th June 1993 can affect native title. This provides an effective means of protecting that native title until a comprehensive piece of legislation can be agreed on by this parliament. Any question of the constitutionality of this legislation will throw into doubt the constitutionality of the Government's bill as the primary clause (clause 4) in my legislation is based on clause 11 of the Native Title Bill 1993. Clause 5 of my bill is merely an extension of the legal protection provided by the previous clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Margetts and myself make up only 2 votes out of the 76 Senators in this place, we can do nothing by ourselves to put in place the legislative mechanism to allow for that scrutiny and consultation to take place. The responsibility of any failure to fulfil our democratic obligations will firmly rest with all of us. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report is the latest in a series of reports presented by the Committee over the past two years dealing with international students attending private educational institutions in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the unanimous view of the Committee that the ESOS Amendment Bill 1993 will achieve the necessary level of protection for the interests of international students, and prevent any further drain on those students and on the public purse in the event of failure of a private education provider. The Committee reiterates its support for an industry-based tuition assurance scheme by which displaced students of a failed college would be able to complete their course of studies in another institution. However, such a scheme must accommodate the wide range of education providers operating in the industry, and must provide for exemptions where appropriate. Details of a suitable scheme or schemes are still in the process of being developed by a joint Working Group of departmental officials and industry representatives. The Committee is therefore reserving its judgment on the structure and details of a tuition assurance scheme until that consultative, developmental process has been completed.</PARA>

But even if we disagree with the amendment, we cannot have the situation where a legitimate debate about the rights of individuals in employment generates a scare&mdash;and I will not call it a `scare campaign' because that attributes motives to the person who raised it which I am not trying to do&mdash;amongst people that in some way their children might be in danger, and that is without any foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously nobody can give a comprehensive definition of everything that is ever going to be deemed to be an inherent requirement of every employment position in the country. That is much too comprehensive a brief. I was trying to say that, quite clearly, Senator O'Chee's example falls outside any such definition. It would be a matter for employees who were seeking to exercise their rights under this clause. If they claimed they had been dismissed contrary to this, in the normal course of events I assume they would need to indicate that it was not reasonable, and challenge. Depending on the circumstances of the case, an individual might need to establish that it was reasonable. I do not want to get into the argument about where the onus lies; that may well be determined by the nature of the case in question.

There are nine million people in employment and there are hundreds of thousands of different jobs. The inherent requirements of those vary immeasurably. There is no narrow definition that will describe the inherent requirements of all positions. What I would have thought was sufficiently clear to satisfy any reasonable person is that criminal acts against children conflict with the inherent requirements of a position of taking care of children. I would have thought that was not an unreasonable proposition. If anyone wants to suggest that in some way performing criminal acts against children does not breach the inherent requirements of being in charge of children, go right ahead; I will be fascinated to hear the argument.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with what Senator McMullan has said. As my colleague Senator Crane has pointed out, there is no clear definition, and I do not think Senator McMullan's arguments are well-founded in law. I wish to deal with the burden of proof, which Senator McMullan said might be a changeable thing depending upon the circumstances. That may well be the case but when one looks at the structure of clause 170DF, the first subclause says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An employer must not terminate an employee's employment for any one or more of the following reasons . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Subclause (2) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection (1) does not prevent a matter referred to in paragraph (1)(e) from being a reason for terminating employment if the reason is based on the inherent requirements of the particular position.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a defence. Subclause (2) sets up a defence to an action by an employee who claims wrongful dismissal. To the extent that it sets up a defence, the burden of proof is on the employer, not on the employee. I can imagine one or two situations arising where the employee might have to discharge a burden of proof but, on the whole, the burden of proof rests with the employer. That is the first qualification of what the minister has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the substance of what the minister has said. Subclause (2) applies only to subclause (1)(e). That refers to race, colour, sex, marital status, family responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin. There are clearly cases where those things are an inherent bar to the requirements of a particular position. For example, in Western Australia there is a busy trade in selling sheep that are slaughtered according to Islamic tradition. One obviously cannot be Jewish and work in one of those slaughterhouses. In fact, one cannot be Christian and work in one of those slaughterhouses; one must be Muslim, and even then there are particular requirements&mdash;I understand they have to have a mullah and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such situations are a clear case of where being of a different religion bars one inherently from meeting the requirements of a particular position. Another example would be people who are not Jewish working in a Jewish butchery, where there are similar religious requirements. What we have to deal with here is the word `inherent'. That is the important word, because sexual preference may well be different from sexual practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can imagine the situation of a person who has previously been convicted of an offence of paedophilia not disclosing that conviction when applying for and gaining employment in, for example, a kindergarten. When it is subsequently revealed that this person has a conviction for paedophilia, that person could say, `No, my sexual preference is not an inherent bar to my meeting the requirements of this particular position on the basis that I no longer practice paedophilia. I was previously a paedophile and I am undergoing counselling and I am not doing it now', or whatever. Such a person would say that the important thing is not the preference but the practice. I can very clearly see a case like that coming up and maybe that person even winning under the wording that is here. That is why I do not think the clause the minister has referred to does, in fact, answer the question. We have to have the peace of mind of the families at heart, and that is why I believe this amendment should not be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to question the minister further with regard to this particular clause. One cannot look at a clause in isolation when there is a series of them&mdash;although I know that we are dealing with some. We cannot look at them without also looking at the exemption relating to institutions, because they all relate to one another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister noted `the inherent requirements of the particular position' relating to this clause. There is an exemption with regard to a person's employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed. My interpretation is that that relates to private schools which are run from a religious base, whether they be a convent, a grammar school or a school of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to those words, `the inherent requirements of the particular position', and noting that exemption, I ask the minister: what is the position if an employer has particularly strong Christian or Muslim beliefs? What rights do people have in, for example, the situation that was highlighted by Senator O'Chee a moment ago, which related to the slaughter of stock in this country for export overseas? What is the position of individuals who have particularly strong beliefs&mdash;which some people in this country quite legitimately have&mdash;under that wording?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest to the minister that, in fact, their position and their right to that belief are not covered. I would also suggest that consideration has not been given to that in subclause (1)(e) and the additional words which will come into play. One might well ask Senator Spindler why that particular aspect has not been covered. It is all very well to amend one part of an act but one should look at the consequences which flow into another part of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know myself&mdash;and I am sure that Senator Spindler knows&mdash;that there are some people who hold particularly strong beliefs about certain things. In fact, some people take a stance according to their religious creed with regard to the impact of this clause. So why is it necessary to go beyond what is already included in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act? These matters are covered in that particular act. This is cluttering up an industrial relations act and causing a lot of confusion. It will cause a lot of heartburn for a lot of people&mdash;and quite legitimate heartburn. Why cannot this matter be left where it properly belongs in our view&mdash;in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act?</PARA>

I thought he put his argument as well as it could have been put, but it is not conceivable to put together a case in which any judicial authority in Australia would find that it is a reasonable requirement that anybody could be required to employ a paedophile to take care of children. I have to say that is stretching the bounds of credibility. When the issue was first raised without subsection 170DF(2) having been pointed out, I could see how people could think that this was a problem. That is why I quickly sought to point out to them that it was not possible because of that subsection being there to protect against those sorts of concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broader question that Senator Crane now raises, which is similar to that which Senator Harradine raised last night, is important. This is the so-called cluttering up issue. On the face of it, we can see why people raise it because, for example, the amendment Senator Crane is now talking about, which modifies the anti-discrimination provisions of the bill in the ways to which he has referred, duplicates the exceptions that are already set out in the definition of `discrimination' in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act of 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So on the face of it we can say the same anti-discrimination provisions are there, the same exceptions are there; why do we need it? There are two closely related issues that I want to address. One is that we need to recognise that the way in which, the conditions under which, the reasons for which, people are dismissed are not infrequently the basis of industrial disputes. Anybody&mdash;and that includes several people, as I look around this chamber&mdash;who has been involved in one way or another in industrial relations would know that disputes often arise, and some of the most difficult disputes often arise as a result of the dismissal of employees and the grounds on which they are dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, there is a fundamental industrial relations issue involved here. We are not introducing some new and alien concept that there is an industrial relations issue around the termination of employment, the rights of people to go to the Industrial Relations Commission to deal with issues to do with termination. There has been debate around what should be the powers of industrial relations bodies to deal with this. For more than 20 years&mdash;because I was involved in it in the early 1970s; so it is not a new issue&mdash;industrial relations authorities have had power in this area on and off in various states.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a significant extra element. The first is that, as I say, there is a profound industrial relations issue involved. It goes fundamentally to the relationship of an employee to his or her employer. Therefore, it is a question fundamentally in relation to the contract of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act does not give any enforceable remedy to the individual who is discriminated against on the grounds of sexual preference. So it is fundamentally different. That is not to denigrate the very useful assistance that can be provided to people who have been discriminated against in other areas. Such assistance has been provided by the human rights commission and its various agencies over the period of its existence. It has been very worthwhile, but it does not lead to a situation of any enforceable remedy for the dismissed employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there is a fundamental industrial relations issue involved, so there is nothing inappropriate about its being in the industrial relations legislation. Secondly, it is not a mere duplication of the human rights act provisions because it provides for the employee that which they would not otherwise have&mdash;an enforceable remedy. It is a question of being able, through the Industrial Relations Commission, to find a resolution that is both fundamental to the rights of the individual worker and central to the resolution of the industrial relations dispute that might ensue as a result of the termination of employment. </PARA>

He referred to the position of an employer who holds a very strong philosophical view which may be contrary to the disability, age or sexual preference of the person who is an employee. I think that, as a matter of very strong principle, we should distinguish between a disagreement on philosophy, on values, on opinions or on preferences, and the right to disadvantage a person on the basis of that disagreement in an employment situation. I think that is precisely what anti-discrimination legislation is about.

Senator Murphy was a shearer and he knows that they work in a closed camp situation. I believe that conflict could be started, not necessarily by the homosexual, but by the rest of the crew.

The driver has to climb up a couple of metres to get into his position on the vehicle, so we have to employ someone who is physically fit. If the driver has an accident, he is covered by employer's liability. If he needs time off after that, he is covered right down the track.

It is appropriate and desirable under other legislation, such as the disability services legislation, that one takes every reasonable action to find a way to do so.

It is reasonable grounds for considering what views one might form about the people refusing to go there, but it is not grounds for sacking the black worker. It is a very difficult situation.

If the teacher, by word and influence, is going to have an undue influence on these children, surely that is a matter that needs to be taken into account.

The bill says, `You don't only have a right to seek conciliation under that legislation; you have rights as an employee, flowing from this legislation, to be reinstated. You have the capacity to have an enforceable remedy'. That is the primary thing. I think that arguably a secondary benefit will flow from the conciliation and arbitration power, but that might be limited.

Part of the great aim of a liberal society is to ensure that we maintain these values and recognise and tolerate diversity. We are seeing these prescriptive views in quite a few areas. We saw them yesterday in the child-care guidelines and we are seeing them again today in Senator Spindler's amendments. Our desire to suddenly move with full force to protect one group of people may trample on another group of people. I say to Senator Spindler and Senator McMullan that I have listened very carefully to what they have said but I am not convinced that they have tackled those issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise with the minister some matters relating to the objects of the act. I ask for an explanation as to why the wording of the objects of the 1988 act has changed from `to promote industrial harmony and cooperation among the parties involved in industrial relations' to `to provide a framework for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes'. The changes are very significant. Is section (e) in the objects of the act a direct recognition of the very significant changes that are being made as far as boycott provisions, restrictions on common law tort actions and removal of the responsibilities of union organisers on a work site are concerned? In fact, under the current 1988 act it is illegal for union officials or union organisers to incite people in the workplace&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

This amendment will remove that so that it will no longer be an offence under the Industrial Relations Act to go into the workplace and incite employees. Is this a direct recognition and admission right at the start of the act that the government is expecting to have more industrial disputation? If the government is not expecting that, why have the objects been changed?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard people on the other side of the chamber mention many times&mdash;and I have not disagreed with it&mdash;that in many of the unions today there is a much more objective attitude towards behaviour. Is not the fact that the government is changing those objectives a direct recognition that it is anticipating more disruption, more civil disobedience and a number of other things? If not, why is it necessary to change the objects of the act from `to promote industrial harmony and cooperation'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to confess that I have not engaged in a great deal of philosophical discussion about why the wording of the objects has been changed. It is certainly far-fetched to say that it is in some way because we think there will be more disputes under the legislation.

What we have here is a much more functional description. The wording `prevention and settlement of industrial disputes', as Senator Crane would know, comes straight out of the constitutional power. We now have a functional description of what it is intended to do. It takes out some of the rhetorical flourish and describes in a much more pragmatic way what it is intending to do.

The fact that we do not have a particular form of words in no way implies that we regard the successful conduct of industrial relations and the minimisation of time lost through industrial disputes as anything other than a very important objective of government. It is one in which we have been uniquely successful and we expect this legislation to facilitate our continuing to be very successful. It gets a bit esoteric for me to then pursue whether we need to say something is about sweetness and light or, rather, describe the processes by which we will achieve it.

I would like to point out, in supporting the remarks made by Senator Bell on this issue, that the aim is to expedite the making of an interim award.

The bill itself does not require the commission to expedite the creation of interim awards to speed the approval of an enterprise flexibility agreement. The amendment, whether it be the coalition amendment or the Democrat amendment, resolves the inconsistency by adding a new paragraph to proposed section 1D that requires the commission to speed interim awards that would facilitate enterprise flexibility agreements. The Metway Bank pointed out its inconsistency in its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It also pointed out that there was no guarantee that the commission would speedily make an interim award to cover its senior staff if at some stage the company wished to negotiate a single enterprise flexibility agreement, that is, if it was unable to negotiate a certified agreement. That is the reason for the moving of this amendment. </PARA>

I will not take up the time of the Senate unduly, but there are some things that we need to say. While we will not divide on it, I make clear that the government opposes this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the purpose of the amendment. I think it is a welcome purpose because it is designed to assist in the making of enterprise flexibility agreements which the government supports. That is why we are proposing to put them into the legislation in the first place. In this instance it is not a disagreement of purpose but of process. Therefore, we cannot support the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we will find a very puzzling situation because, as practitioners will know, awards by their nature are made between employers and unions who are parties to interstate disputes. That is what the Industrial Relations Commission power allows.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But enterprise flexibility agreements by their nature are not. They apply to employers and employees who are not parties to the relevant award covering those employees. There seems to me to be a very tenuous connection between the interim award and the agreement. The best that I can say for this amendment is that I do not think it will do much harm, but I cannot see how it will do any good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am amused to see that the government is in the position of expressing concerns that the states are concerned about this proposal. The states have shown considerable sensitivity about the potential for enterprise flexibility agreements made under the corporations power to intrude into their jurisdiction. I think they would therefore be concerned that the use of interim awards for this purpose might be a problem for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are more than a little concerned in this instance that a further difficulty arises in that not all state awards are kept up to date. We could wind up with differing standards applying for the purpose of the no disadvantage test. I have serious apprehension about this proposal, but I suspect that it will have such extremely limited application that it probably will not do much harm. I indicate that the government is opposed to it. I think wiser counsel would suggest that one should not do this, but I would rather lose before 12.45&mdash;unless some honourable senators leap up and tells me that they are about to change their minds&mdash;than continue the debate after lunch. </PARA>

For the edification of the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) in determining what good it will do, I point out that the opportunity to make an interim award allows the determination of an enterprise flexibility agreement to proceed with an award underpinning it. Without that, it would be much more difficult to determine no disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the concern of the states is fairly transparent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When debate on the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill was interrupted last week, I was speaking about superannuation, which was one of the matters covered in this bill. Before returning to the point that I was making, I would like to recap very briefly. I had outlined that this bill amends five acts and that the amendments concern such subjects as superannuation, limiting of appeals from the Conscientious Objection Tribunal, streamlining of overseas command procedures, mechanics of appointment for Welfare Trust Fund trustees, changes to eligibility for defence home loans and a minor amendment affecting salvage claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had made the point that while the bill has no real theme, its focus was on rights and conditions of service for Defence Force members. In particular, I spent some time on the fact that this bill was amending the eligibility rules for gaining a Defence Force home loan. Yet some while ago in these sittings of parliament, the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 was passed which ensured that such loans are now to be considered as a fringe benefit for family payment and additional family payment purposes. The amount of the loan is to be assessed by a formula which is contained in the legislation; a formula which I suspect carries its own potential difficulties when income is being reviewed by Social Security for the purpose of ascertaining how much family payment or additional family payment a person is to receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many defence families are about to start to feel the effect of this social security change. It comes into effect on 1 January which is the same time as the annual posting period is undertaken in the defence forces. Exacerbating this concern is the fact that Social Security is unable to provide detailed evidence for recipients of family payment and additional family payment on precisely how they will be affected. Defence families are now facing postings. Ahead of them is Christmas with all its related costs; then into January, when it is time to look at the costs associated with schooling; and all these expenses need to be budgeted for. Yet these families are unable to obtain from Social Security the full details of how they will be placed in the New Year under that amended legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During estimates, the minister made it clear that he did not know what effect the changes to the legislation would have; he did not even know the details of its implementation. I advise the minister to spend some time in his office taking some of the phone calls and receiving the letters that have been flooding into my office in recent months in relation to what is happening there, and he will learn a few of the facts of life of the legislation that he so enthusiastically put through earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For another group of defence people, Christmas in new locations with new schools will mean quite a different set of expenses because these are people who have been made redundant through either the CSP or the force structure review. As I was outlining last week, according to the reports I am receiving, in the case of some of these people, superannuation is being used as a tool to ensure that people who have effectively been made redundant but who have not been offered a redundancy package, are nevertheless forced out of the services. In such circumstances, it is a voluntary separation and, therefore, they are not entitled to a redundancy package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personnel who have been replaced by civilians as a consequence of the CSP are, in some cases, being offered continued employment in the defence forces but at a lower pay and skill scale with a consequential detrimental effect on their DFRDB, and if they do not like that, they can leave. Most ADF personnel cannot afford to see their superannuation slip back, so they opt to leave. This is good for the government because it ensures that the projected level of separations and the reduction of numbers in the Defence Force that it is driving for and targeting under the review program are met. But at the end of the day it is yet another indirect attack on the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of grave concern to the opposition that the Defence Force personnel in this country, under this government, are all too frequently under attack&mdash;not in a military sense, but with respect to their conditions of service. The great thing about the defence forces that makes them different from all other sections of the community is that they do not have any way to protect their interests. They are terribly dependent on having an effective minister or ministers of defence to look after their interests. That is simply not happening at the present time. Neither of the ministers&mdash;the Minister for Defence (Senator Rober Ray) or the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner)&mdash;is doing a thing to look after the welfare of the members of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are spending a huge amount of money&mdash;a huge fraction&mdash;a record amount of the defence vote, on new capital equipment. All the equipment in the world is worth nothing unless we have capable, experienced people of high morale to operate that equipment. That is not happening at the present time because the emphasis is on the hardware, not on the human resources. Morale in the forces now is very low. People know that there is no real defence policy for this country so, therefore, there is no real purpose&mdash;no raison d'etre&mdash;for their existence and training. They know that the training they are receiving is far less than they should get, because year after year the defence budget is going down and the capital equipment vote is going up. So the percentage gain to capital equipment gets higher as a part of the Defence vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way the squeeze can be made is by driving people out, which has a deleterious effect on morale, as we have seen in the force structure review, with progressive falling numbers in the defence forces; and by cuts in the operating and training budgets&mdash;all the things that are part and parcel of defence professional life. This induces a great state of anxiety within the defence forces. Anxiety now is a constant feature of service life: people are anxious about where the ADF is going; they are anxious about their personal affairs, and what their remuneration packages are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government set up the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal&mdash;a very flawed instrument; an instrument that at the end of the day makes the CDF, the Chief of the Defence Force, the advocate for improvements in pay and conditions for service personnel, but then makes it mandatory on him to pay that out of his Defence vote. In other words, if the CDF says we need an increase in the service allowance&mdash;which is now very much overdue&mdash;the only resort the CDF has under this system is to cut back even more in other areas of his budget outlays within the Department of Defence to pay for that increase in pay and conditions. That is transparently wrong. Yet that is the system that this government has put in place, and it is the system that it obstinately refuses to review. It is having a very serious effect on the morale of the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just go back to the instance I used of the service allowance. That allowance is paid to defence personnel for the disabilities they suffer in being posted to all parts of Australia or overseas; and to make up for the fact that they have no overtime, and in certain conditions can be working very long hours a week in very uncongenial circumstances. That allowance has been a constant part of service life for many years. It now has very little meaning because it has not been reviewed for something like six years and it has taken no account at all of the great changes in inflation that have occurred within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all these reasons, morale is very low in the Defence Force, and the men and women in that Defence Force deserve far better treatment than they are getting from this government. The government and the ministers responsible for this have shown no interest at all in defending, let alone advancing, the interests of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. But the opposition is prepared to speak out and see that they get a better go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon raised, essentially, three issues. I do not intend to respond to the allegations of low morale in the defence forces. I am certainly not in a position to address that matter, and I am sure that Senator Robert Ray as the Minister for Defence, and Senator Faulkner as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, can deal with it on another occasion. I do not believe that the criticism of the two ministers is appropriate; I strongly support their handling of their portfolios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon raised a number of issues that I do not think are central to this debate. However, firstly, he asked why the requirement to restrict the right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals was not foreseen. In response, I can say that provision for conscientious objection tribunals was made by the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 1992, and the requirement for the amendment now proposed was noted after the bill for the act had been introduced into the House. As there were no practical implications, it was decided to make a subsequent amendment rather than delay the passage of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted that this amendment was requested by the Administrative Review Council. The amendment brings the conscientious objection provisions into line with current administrative law policy; namely, that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal provides final review on the merits, and subsequent review by the courts is on questions of law only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that Senator MacGibbon referred to was the application of social security fringe benefit provisions to home loans assistance. The extent of the applicability of the recent amendments to the Social Security Act to housing loans made under the defence homes loans assistance scheme, is still under investigation. Clearly, there is a separate issue from the provision in this bill which, as Senator MacGibbon has acknowledged, extends home loans assistance benefits in recognition of overseas service by Defence Force members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter raised by Senator MacGibbon was his suggestion that superannuation penalties on voluntary retirement were being used to force separations from the defence forces. The government strongly rejects that as the basis of the policy. The Defence Force scheme provides for pensions after 20 years of service, but, to encourage officers to serve beyond the 20 years, there is a penalty for those who retire before a specified notional retiring age. Management has no discretion in the matter, so there could be no question of misuse of this provision. The penalty does not, of course, apply to officers who are involuntarily retired. It is noted that there is no provision for notional retiring ages in the military superannuation and benefits scheme which has replaced the defence forces scheme. With that I conclude my remarks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Departure Tax Act 1978 to increase the departure tax from $20 to $25. The bill is due to have effect from 1 January next year. The idea of a departure tax originated from one of the 40 recommendations of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism in 1978 and was first introduced for persons departing Australia by the 1978 act. The decision to increase the departure tax from $20 to $25 was announced in the 1993-94 budget and is expected to boost revenue by $11 million in this financial year and $28 million to $30 million in a full year. The stated purpose of the increase is to offset the additional costs of tourism promotion expenditure which was announced in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned to me by airport operators that the more the government takes in the way of airport charges, such as departure taxes and the like, the less ability those operators have to raise their own funds from incoming and outgoing users of their airports. Because of the current government's insatiable appetite for money, some of the authorities which operate these airports are lacking in funds to improve and maintain their airports. A further concern is that an inequitable proportion of the tourism revenue and consolidated revenue collected from airports is returned to airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague in the other place Mr David Jull, the shadow minister for tourism&mdash;an excellent one at that&mdash;has very skilfully and capably discussed the effects of this bill on the tourism industry and has outlined the major concerns which arise from its implementation. I note also that my Queensland colleagues, Mr Slipper and Mr Braithwaite, have spoken on the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to talk about the bill but also specifically about the effect of the increased departure tax on the tourism industry in North Queensland. I note in passing that the honourable member for Herbert, Mr Lindsay, has once again shown his complete lack of interest in the many tourism-dependent people in his North Queensland electorate of Herbert by failing to represent them on this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">North Queensland is undoubtedly one of the fastest, if not the fastest, growing and most prominent international tourism destinations in Australia. We have hundreds of idyllic and diverse destinations, such as the Great Barrier Reef, the Whitsunday Islands, the lava caves at Undarra, the Chillagoe mines, the volcanic lakes on the Atherton Tableland, the Daintree tropical rainforest, Lawn Hill and Riverslea, not to mention the endless miles of beaches and islands at Mission Beach and Dunk Island south of Innisfail&mdash;all in the electorate of Kennedy. We also have many attractions, such as Townsville's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park World, the scenic railways at Kuranda and Forsyth and the Stockman's Hall of Fame at Longreach. The list of North Queensland's tourism assets goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again mention in passing, Mr Acting Deputy President, a matter I know you personally are concerned about. All those beautiful beaches up my way, and even Ninety Mile Beach and Bells Beach down your way would, if the recommendations in the Resource Assessment Commission's report came into operation, perhaps be fenced off or in some way taxed before people would be allowed to use them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention some facts which indicate the growth of tourism in the Cairns region. Total international visitor numbers to Cairns have climbed from 394,000 in 1991 to 508,000 in 1992. That is almost a 30 per cent increase in one year. In 1982 the number of international passengers using the Cairns airport was a mere 15,000; the number is now 1.2 million. The average annual growth over the last decade of international visitors to Cairns has been 23 per cent and Cairns airport now sees 178 international flight movements per week. Some 21 per cent of all international visitors to Australia now visit the Cairns region and Cairns now sees more holiday purpose visitors than the whole of Victoria. Cairns has a large share of the Asian market, with one in four Japanese who come to Australia actually visiting Cairns. Only a couple of weeks ago the prominent Asian airline Cathay Pacific commenced two flights per week between Cairns and Hong Kong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the growth in the Cairns tourism industry, it has been necessary to treat it with extreme delicacy when implementing any policy such as this policy on departure tax. It is well known that the Labor government is anything but delicate, regularly implementing policies which show no foresight and which often have no economic foundation. One only has to look at Labor's recent proposal for a fringe benefits tax on business accommodation and travel, which would have ruined the tourism industry, to see that this government has no ability when it comes to policy making. Fortunately, the FBT on business accommodation and travel, which would have had such disastrous effects on the tourism, travel and convention industry, has been shelved for the moment and I hope it stays shelved. The tourism industry well remembers that proposal. It was brought in without any thought by this government and could have cost anywhere between 10,000 and 18,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can understand why it is necessary to be very careful in accepting any bill which this government proposes. I find some relief, however, in the fact that the Departure Tax Amendment Bill extends a policy which was carefully thought through and researched by a responsible Liberal government in 1978. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was well thought through and carefully done in those days. We support this bill, as the parliamentary secretary knows. We want him to know that we are very carefully watching what the government does with the money and watching that it does not increase it to an outrageous figure. We also want the government to consider other things that could be done with the money&mdash;perhaps assisting some of the non-government airport operators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The North Queensland tourism industry will be making a significant contribution to the revenue collected from this departure tax. Tourists who pass through Cairns already have to budget for added costs imposed by operators because of the remoteness of their operations. They also have to budget for innumerable taxes which are facing the tourism industry across Australia already. These include: sales tax, which has just been increased by this government; fuel tax, which impacts very heavily on the tourism industry&mdash;that has just been increased by this government; the wine excise, again a tax that falls more heavily on the tourism industry than most, and which has just been put up again; and so on. My colleague Mr Jull stated in the House of Representatives that the tourism industry contributed some $7 billion to the public purse last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, most importantly, tourists who visit Cairns have to budget for paying taxes which are specific to North Queensland. Most notably, they have to budget for up to $7 extra per reef visit as a result of the recently imposed reef tax. There are suggestions that private boat owners might have to be taxed if they go anywhere near the reef. Visitors to Cairns have to pay specific taxes if they want to go into the Daintree area or travel on the Kuranda scenic railway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is evident that this government treats the tourism industry simply as a milch cow that it can milk whenever it runs short of money. Of course, it is always running short of money because it simply cannot manage the economy. It has little idea of how to balance budgets and it shows no enthusiasm for trying to expand the economy. It does not seem to matter to this government that every tax it imposes on the tourism industry lessens our ability to compete with the Pacific and Asian regions for European and American tourists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry is affected by every tax that is imposed. The budgets of local authorities are also affected by taxes that are imposed by governments. Councils in regional Australia recently had to pay the fuel tax hikes. The federal government seems to forget councils in North Queensland when it comes to the need for infrastructure in the growing tourist regions. The Cook shire, which takes in most of the Cape York area, desperately needs some money to put into basic infrastructure, such as the track to Cape York. But this government seems to ignore reasonable requests for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shire itself is too small to have a financial base to provide all the infrastructure that is needed. Because this facility is used mainly by people who are not ratepayers, the Cook shire is in a difficult predicament; it should provide basic infrastructure in the form of toilets and garbage tips but it does not have the money to do so. I ask that the Cook shire receive sympathetic consideration when it seeks assistance from the federal government for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the departure tax is just one of a number of taxes. One wonders how many more taxes will be imposed on the tourism industry before the tourists start avoiding Australian tourism destinations. Unfortunately, the current government cannot understand that the Australian tourism industry is in competition with the regions that I have mentioned. If the government continues to forget this, we will lose our competitive edge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reinforce some of Mr Jull's statements about the methods used to collect the departure tax. The methods being used are both inefficient and old-fashioned. At present, people leaving the country have to line up at cages at international airports to pay their money. One would think that the government could organise a more subtle approach to collecting the tax. It should not be quite so obvious to visitors that they are being taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could learn from the American system under which international tourists are charged some $30 in departure tax without even being aware of it. The government in America puts the tax onto the airline tickets. In that way, the departure tax is hidden&mdash;not that there is any deception&mdash;in the cost of the airline ticket. The Americans do not do what we do in Australia&mdash;that is, simply flash with neon lights that the government is taxing tourists leaving Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Visitors to the Cairns airport pay a local Cairns airport charge, which is really part of the airport's charge against the aviation companies. The aviation companies pass that on by way of adding to the price of their tickets. That is a much more subtle and better way of doing it. I would have thought that the government might have, at some stage, given some consideration to a more appropriate way of collecting the departure tax. It needs a much more subtle approach. I am sure that if we were to have a closer look at the US system and other overseas systems, we would find better ways of collecting that tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to keep the Senate any longer in relation to this matter. I simply repeat that the Liberal and National parties will not be opposing the increase in the departure tax. We are wary about the extra weight that it is putting onto the tourism industry. We will be watching closely to monitor how the government spends the money. We want to make sure that it does go back into tourism promotion, as the government indicated it would, and not into the general coffers. We will be keeping an eye on those matters, but at this stage we will not be opposing the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an opportune time to enter this debate on the Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1993. An article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> carries the headline `Compass blamed for tourism slump'. The article states that the Western Australian Tourist Commission's figures show that there were 252,000 arrivals at Perth domestic airport last financial year compared with 408,000 in 1991-92. The collapse of Compass&mdash;I am talking about the first Compass; the second Compass did not come to Western Australia&mdash;is blamed for that. However, I put the blame for the collapse of Compass onto the other airlines, which for many years operated under a two-airline agreement. I believe that those airlines caused the collapse of Compass.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Tourist Commission found that Western Australia is affected more than any other state because 82 per cent of visitors to Western Australia come by air and only 11 per cent come by road. That big drop in road travel is very understandable in view of the increases in fuel levies that this government makes all the time. The distances and the cost involved mean that fewer people are travelling by road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Tourist Commission also said that there is a big boom in tourism to Western Australia from South-East Asia. Any new taxes&mdash;a departure tax will be paid when visitors leave&mdash;that are imposed on tourism will affect this market. Increased tourism from South-East Asia is helping the industry. A lot of tourists come from Malaysia and I hope that the Malaysian incident, caused by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), does not affect this. </PARA>

We should draw to the attention of the public that this is one of the few far-sighted tax proposals that we have had from the opposition over the last decade or so. I compliment the opposition on its foresight in proposing this tax. In fact, we picked it up, ran with it and further refined it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A considerable array of issues were raised by Senator Ian Macdonald. He criticised my colleague in the other place Mr Lindsay for not speaking on this matter. We all know the constraints on time that we have, both here and in the House of Representatives. It is simply not possible for every member or every senator to speak on everything that comes before the chambers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had an interesting discourse on tourism in North Queensland from Senator Macdonald.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject the contention of Senator Macdonald that we are proposing to put fences around beaches and charge taxes and access fees to beaches. I was reading the report Senator Macdonald was referring to this morning. The Coastal Zone Inquiry report, which was handed down yesterday, is a series of policy recommendations to government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At times I had to wonder whether Senator Macdonald was supporting the legislation, in view of some of his criticisms, but in fact he made one very pertinent point which in fact contradicts his position on this matter. He highlighted the enormous growth in international visits into and out of Cairns. He is certainly right. There has been enormous growth. The departure tax of $20 has not affected the growth in tourism into and out of Australia in any way. He highlighted one area, Cairns, where in fact the industry is booming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald criticised an alleged array of taxes which adversely affect the tourism industry&mdash;the fuel tax, the sales tax, the wine excise&mdash;and he brought up the matter of a reef tax. I simply point out to him that in the last election the coalition proposed to replace many of these taxes with one great big tax called the GST. There is no doubt that the GST would have been a net additional tax burden on the tourism industry. That is one reason those opposite were not elected at the last election. </PARA>

This bill will facilitate the establishment of branch operations in Australia by ensuring that foreign banks currently operating as authorised bank subsidiaries or money market corporations are not disadvantaged compared with new foreign bank entrants when establishing branch banking operations in Australia. So the purpose really is to facilitate the transfer of assets and liabilities from foreign bank subsidiaries in Australia to the new branch-type operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that this is but the first part of perhaps a greater package of bills, some of which may find expression in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), which we hope may be introduced next week into the House of Representatives.

It is the second part, I understand, that is not so attractive to the foreign operators as the first&mdash;and very much the pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a shame that we did not have the complete package introduced into the parliament at the same time rather than having to look at two or maybe three pieces of legislation to understand the government's full intent in allowing branches of foreign subsidiaries to be established in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided to permit the issue of banking authorities to foreign-owned banks where the Reserve Bank of Australia is satisfied that the bank and its home supervisor are of sufficient standing, and where the bank agrees to comply with the Reserve Bank of Australia prudential, superannuation and other arrangements. This measure is in line with the government's commitment to open up the economy. Indeed, it will bring benefits of competition in the domestic banking system and help its international competitiveness. It is a significant liberalisation in the context of trade and financial services negotiation of the Uruguay Round of GATT. A lot of those statements find expression in the One Nation statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now take the Senate back in history to illustrate the turnaround in the government's approach to foreign banking. In a nutshell, initially, foreign banks were required to set up in Australia as subsidiaries. Now the government will allow foreign branches. We welcome that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1984, as part of the deregulation process, the policy on foreign bank entry was changed. The then Treasurer called for applications from domestic and foreign interests wishing to operate as banks in Australia. In announcing the decision, the then Treasurer indicated that the establishment of new banks would bring substantial benefits to the Australian community through the development of a more innovative, efficient and competitive financial sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that, in 1985-86, 15 foreign banks were authorised under the Banking Act as incorporated subsidiaries. In fact, there were no further authorisations until after the One Nation statement was delivered. The new foreign banks that commenced in Australia had high expectations of their future impact on the Australian market and also of what services they could provide. Unfortunately, by and large, those expectations were not met. The new foreign banks focused their activities primarily on the wholesale or corporate sectors, providing competition in those areas, but few actually established a wide retail banking presence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Martin report of 1991&mdash;the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration&mdash;recommended that foreign banks from countries offering Australian banks reciprocal access be permitted to operate in Australia as branches, subject to a series of conditions. This bill, I remind the Senate, largely seeks to implement that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer's One Nation statement and his 18 June 1993 banking policy statement continue to reflect high hopes for increased competition in the banking industry. Submissions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reflect that to date the government has been totally unsuccessful in achieving this goal. Foreign banks have had a limited impact on the Australian market. Few have established a retail banking presence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One side effect of these new foreign banks establishing subsidiaries in Australia has been the creation of a fear amongst some of the established banks in Australia. They went out to secure their market share at almost any cost. Unfortunately, a few became rather reckless in their lending. At present, shareholders and depositors are paying the price, in terms of reduced returns and, perhaps, higher interest rate charges, as a number of the banks seek to recover their losses through increased charges. I believe that one of the consequences, and certainly a downside, was the Australian banks seeking to maintain their market share and not watching the prudential standards, which resulted in some reckless lending. Of course, that coincided with the downturn in the economy. The two taken together had a deleterious effect on a number of Australian banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the impact of the foreign banking operations, which largely have focused their activity on the wholesale or corporate sectors. There are several reasons for this phenomenon. Firstly, operating as subsidiaries has actually increased the cost of raising funds so that they have been unable to compete on an equal footing with domestic banks. That was one of the downsides to having a subsidiary operation in Australia. The second reason was the high barriers to competition. The third was the cost of satisfying accounting and reporting requirements of the parent bank and such things as reports for Australian regulatory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Martin report, the committee considered the benefits of allowing foreign banks to operate as branches to be increasing competition in the Australian banking industry and bringing Australia into line with the practice of the major world and regional financial centres to indicate that Australia is willing to participate openly and freely in the worldwide financial system. However, despite the government's optimism, I believe it is extremely unlikely that the foreign banks will rush to set up branches in Australia. That has been indicated by the phone calls I have received today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the go-ahead 15 months ago, foreign branches&mdash;with the exception of three: the United Overseas Bank and the Overseas Union Bank, both based in Singapore, and the recent move by the State Street Bank and Trust of the United States&mdash;have refused to convert subsidiaries to more powerful branches. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has said that the business of the State Street Bank and Trust of the United States will be limited to the wholesale banking business. Banking specialists have said that the changes offered by the government offer no incentive to establish branches and that it will take time for the foreign banks to work through the arithmetic before they can take a more positive view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major explanations for this phenomenon is the withholding tax on interest payable on funds borrowed from head offices. Mr Brett Crowley, a partner of Ernst and Young, has publicly stated that while withholding tax continues no lending will occur as the foreign branches will be paying out more than they could recover. State and Commonwealth government fees, taxes and charges are a problem. Also, there is an inability to transfer certain past losses to branches for tax purposes, depending on the type of arrangements. I will go into that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill moves some way in the right direction, it is clearly not giving enough incentive. Changes the bill is making include that the withholding tax payable on interest on intrabank borrowings will be halved but kept at 10 per cent for any borrowings by foreign branches. While interest withholding tax  is  a  wonderful  revenue  earner,  bringing  up  to  $600 million  a  year  in  tax revenue, its detrimental impact on a number of foreign branches taking up the offer to establish branches in Australia is patently obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A subsidiary that has widely distributed debentures can obtain an exemption from interest withholding tax. The government is concerned that there would be a leakage of tax revenue if a general exemption were to be granted. While the government is prepared to allow an existing exemption held by a subsidiary to be transferred to the new branch as part of the reconstruction from the subsidiary to the branch, it will only allow a limited concession of 50 per cent of interest withholding tax liability for future transactions. So it can be rolled over but the refinancing does not attract the same exemption. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of the existing exemption is covered by clause 23 of the bill. The concessional rate of duty of 50 per cent of interest withholding tax for foreign branches will be covered in subsequent legislation, which I believe could be the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4). It is a pity that we could not have the other part of the legislation when debating the merits of this bill. I understand that foreign branches have lobbied to have the policy changed so that the subsidiaries can take advantage of section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which allows the raising of funds offshore without the payment of interest withholding tax. The foreign branches argue that the relaxation of the rule will actually boost competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another change is the waiving of the payment of Commonwealth and state fees and charges on the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Australian subsidiary of a foreign bank in existence prior to 18 June 1993 to a new Australian bank or to a new authorised bank subsidiary. Under the government's policy, a foreign bank that gained an authority from the Reserve Bank of Australia to operate as a branch would be obliged to conduct the bulk of its international intermediation through a bank. I put it to the Senate that there are some problems in terms of the sorts of subsidiaries that actually can transfer from subsidiary status to branch status. The bill talks about subsidiaries and also money market corporations, but this bill does not provide any definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the difficulty that some existing structures in this area may well not qualify. Could the minister tell me whether property finance group subsidiaries, for example, would qualify in terms of being able to convert to a branch under the arrangements of this bill? There is also the question&mdash;the alarm bells have been rung&mdash;of the allocation of certain head office expenses to the branches. We have already seen difficulties in the life assurance area where the Taxation Office imposes arbitrary allocation formulae. Even more contentious is the fact that the government is considering what is termed a `notional capital concept' whereby an arbitrary amount will be allocated in terms of the head office expenses for the Australian operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the losses, the nature of the subsidiaries, section 128F of the act, the interest withholding tax, the problems that are likely to be raised in tax bill No. 4&mdash;or subsequent bills&mdash;will certainly take off some of the initial gloss or the attraction of this bill. Nevertheless, we welcome it as it is one step forward to opening up the Australian economy, to making the system more competitive and perhaps to providing lower cost financial products to Australian consumers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In today's matters of public interest debate, I raise the matter of the lodging of income tax returns without a tax file number. I refer to a response from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) to a question on notice and to the minister's response on 27 September 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of constituents believe that the answer does not truly reflect a correct interpretation of the tax law. There is no law which requires taxpayers to quote their tax file number upon request. There may be penalties in some circumstances; for example, if a taxpayer fails to quote a TFN, there is a deduction of 48.4 per cent tax at source on salaries, wages, investment incomes and unfranked dividends. When the return is lodged, however, those taxpayers can claim the total tax deducted and, in most cases, the amount withheld would be greater than their liability so they would receive a refund. The real penalty for those taxpayers is that they are denied the use of their funds because of the additional tax that they had paid until their assessment and refund was issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office maintains that under regulations 15 and 34 it has the power to require taxpayers to complete the official return form, and that return form does not have to be accepted until it is signed and completed. The real position is that the tax office has no authority to require taxpayers to quote their tax file numbers or to require them to apply for a tax file number. The problem is that the tax office system needs a tax file number to identify taxpayers and to say that, from a practical point of view, it is in the interests of all taxpayers to have and to quote a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the support that comes, for example, from the Australian Taxpayers Association which supports good law&mdash;but only if the methods are within the law. It believes that under the current laws it is not compulsory to apply for or to have a tax file number. Until this happens, I remind the Senate, all taxpayers&mdash;which includes the tax office&mdash;must abide by the law. The Privacy Act was intended to protect taxpayers' rights, and no law requires a taxpayer at the moment to have a tax file number. The only sanction provided is to deduct tax at the high rate, which is normally the case when a tax file number is not quoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, however, no taxpayers pay a higher amount of tax on their assessment whether or not they have supplied their tax file number. They may initially, but not after assessment. In other words, the penalty imposed on taxpayers for not having or quoting a tax file number is the loss of purchasing power for a limited period of time until their income tax assessment is issued by the tax office. At that point, all taxpayers are treated, and should be treated, the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that a similar issue arose with tax agents who were required by the Tax Agents Board to supply their tax file numbers. On that occasion, the tax office also had to back down. I presume that, in relation to the requests and the tax office's refusal to process returns when people do not have a tax file number, that is not the law at the present time. I take this opportunity in the Senate to remind the tax office of that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly about a report that was made to the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. In the first part of a submission made by Justice Evatt, some comments were made on a speech that I gave to the Senate on 26 October which looked at, among other things, the activities of UN human rights committees. I welcome the contribution that Justice Evatt has made to this debate. I think it is an important debate. In that context, I wish to make a few remarks on the observations that Justice Evatt made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My complaints about the government's activities in relation to UN conventions and UN human rights committees are these: in the first place, the government has clearly overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act in allowing complaints to go to UN committees. Among other things, the Australia Act severed appeals to the Privy Council. At that stage, it was decided, with the agreement of the opposition parties, that the Australian legal system should be self-contained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just five years later, the government has opened up appeals to three UN human rights committees. As a consequence, I believe that it has overturned the philosophy of the Australia Act. As a person who treasures the sovereignty of our nation, I believe that the government has compromised that sovereignty by this action. Nonetheless, those who believe that UN committees should have the right to involve themselves in Australia's domestic activities have a responsibility to make sure that these UN human rights committees are appropriately structured and meet the test of judicial independence and process that we would want for bodies like these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice Evatt made three points about my remarks to the Senate on 26 October. Rather surprisingly, her first point was that she felt my comment about Australia's independence being undermined by allowing UN committees dealing with human rights to involve themselves in Australia's domestic activities was not correct. I am surprised that Justice Evatt runs this line. Even Senator Schacht, who is a great advocate of UN conventions and a strong supporter of allowing UN committees to involve themselves in Australia's domestic activities, concedes that this will undoubtedly undermine the independence and sovereignty of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from a report which Senator Schacht presented to this chamber. Among other things, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been a tendency for the United Nations to limit national sovereignty. This evolution, therefore, increasingly demands a reconsideration of the principle of national sovereignty. United Nations conventions, now covering a wide range of activities, inevitably change the character of domestic institutions, affect domestic legislation and extend accountability beyond the usual domestic constituency.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not often agree with Senator Schacht, but I believe that that report, which was presented to the Senate by the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade summed up the situation quite correctly. I am surprised that Justice Evatt has decided to run the line that in some way Australia's independence is not compromised by our allowing UN committees to involve themselves in our activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some real dilemmas for those who support the internationalism of Senator Gareth Evans and the Labor Party. On the one hand, they are running a campaign against the constitutional monarchy based on the need for Australia to be an independent country. On the other hand, they are opening up Australia's legal system to UN committees. So there is a complete contradiction between those two positions which the Labor Party is running. It is a real problem for it. The republican movement has to make it very clear whether it supports my position and, I hope, your position, Mr Acting Deputy President, that Australia is an independent country and that UN committees have no role in involving themselves in our domestic activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another problem. Justice Evatt has made the point that many of these treaties can only be put into law through an act of this parliament. That is correct, but it raises another issue which people like Justice Evatt and those who support Australia's enmeshing itself in the UN human rights treaties have to face up to. On the one hand, they say it is very important for us to ratify all these conventions and particular articles and protocols which allow these UN committees to become involved in our domestic activities. On the other hand, they try to argue that this does not have any great effect on the independence and sovereignty of the nation. They really cannot have it both ways. If it is so important, it must surely have an effect. The effect naturally is to bring in both a new plane of law to which Australians can appeal and the activities of UN human rights committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those on the other side who support the enmeshing of Australia in UN human rights treaties say on the one hand that these treaties only become law when they are enacted by the parliament. Then, when the bill comes before the parliament, they say that we have to enact this law or we are in breach of the UN human rights treaty that the law is apparently giving some particular effect to. They complete the circle by saying that we have to sign these treaties and enact them into law because Australia will be seen to be not fulfilling its international obligation it we do not actively support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are real contradictions in the arguments of those who so actively support UN human rights treaties. As an aside, it is interesting that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of today, Alan Atkinson makes the point&mdash;I think he is right; it is quite an insight and backs up what I have been saying&mdash;that the main task of the republican movement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has been to persuade the electorate that the monarchy is a foreign imposition, and that republicanism is an assertion of independence. The opposite is true. The republican movement is one aspect of a broad and deeply laid abdication of independence.</PARA>
<PARA>While the author of this article has not touched on certain matters, I believe that he has insight, which I fully endorse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is fairly short, so I will have to be brief. Justice Evatt concedes that the UN human rights committees' rulings have an impact on other countries. That is correct; it is a comment that I have made. If they did not have an impact, why on earth would we bother to ratify the appropriate conventions and protocols to allow them to involve themselves in our country? I agree with Justice Evatt on that score. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her second point concerned the impact of these committees on Australia. She rightly makes the point that this is a relatively new procedure. But I put it to her that the committees' impact not only comes through any legislation which the government may choose to put through. By ratifying the treaties, they give a constitutional head of power. In other words, it has major constitutional impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our courts, particularly the High Court through its Mabo judgment, are paying attention to the possibility that appeals may go to these human rights committees and therefore judgments are being framed in this manner. A finding by a committee can, in effect, provide a head of power for the government of the day to override state government law. So it is an important and significant act. Justice Evatt, who is a member of the UN human rights committee, should not run away from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice Evatt's third point generally confirms my views about whether these committees have proper standards of judicial independence. The walking wounded&mdash;Senator Collins, Senator Bolkus and Senator Faulkner&mdash;have just entered the chamber. Justice Evatt certainly confirms my views about the need for the government to look closely at how these committees operate. She confirms that the appointments are short-term and that in the past members of the UN human rights committees have been under instructions from their own governments; in other words, they have not acted in a fully independent manner. Justice Evatt has confirmed that the hearings of these committees are largely held in private. Of course, an essential feature of our law is that court hearings be public hearings. I believe that is a very important aspect of our legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, I believe that Justice Evatt has largely confirmed my concerns about many of the tests which I have raised about the functioning of these committees. I very much hope that the government will now look seriously at the whole issue of whether these UN human rights committees are appropriately structured to play any role in Australia's domestic activities. I put it to you, Mr President, that I am opposed to this move. The government has a responsibility to make sure that these committees function properly. </PARA>

In June this year, I announced that visitors from both those countries would be able to extend their stay until 31 January 1994. This measure of course recognised, in the case of visitors from Sri Lanka, that while the situation and the standard of human rights in Sri Lanka were continuing to improve the situation was still sufficiently uncertain to warrant the offer of a further extension of stay. Similarly, it was clearly difficult, if not impossible, for visitors from the former Yugoslavia to return to their home countries while fighting there continued.</PARA></TALK.START>

Conditions are still improving in Sri Lanka. However, I hold some concern that there is continuing conflict there and that its effects are felt by the civilian population.

As a long-time supporter of this project, I have to say that I made the point last time that one of the great problems which this proposal lacks is credibility. One of the reasons that it lacks credibility is the over-the-top statements made by politicians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until the announcement about the undisclosed tests was made, as Senator Bourne said, by US energy secretary O'Leary yesterday, the Australian government was not aware that such a significant undisclosed testing program had been conducted. It now appears that almost one in five tests was not publicly disclosed. Our understanding was that it was general practice for the US to announce its tests. We regarded that, at the time, as a welcome practice which was not followed by other nuclear weapon states with independent testing programs. While, to say the least, we are more than a little disappointed and disconcerted that such a large number of tests apparently were conducted, and conducted unnoticed, we now welcome the US disclosure of this information. This at least now heralds a new era of openness about nuclear testing and about nuclear weapons programs in the US generally, which  is, in our view, obviously a very positive development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Analysis of details of the earlier tests could contribute to refining verification techniques for a comprehensive test ban treaty. That is a high priority currently for the government. We have long supported measures to promote transparency in nuclear testing programs. Such transparency facilitates monitoring and lays the foundation for effective verification of a comprehensive test ban treaty. At the UN General Assembly in 1986, we took the lead in establishing a UN register for the notification of nuclear tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to further details about the location of tests in the Pacific, the Australian seismic array, which monitors such underground tests, has detected no tests other than those conducted by France in French Polynesia. It is highly unlikely that any tests would have been conducted recently in the South Pacific. The Treaty of Rarotonga, which entered into force in 1986, banned such testing and successive US administrations have said on many occasions that none of their activities in the region are inconsistent with the provisions of that treaty. I think it is reasonable to take them on face value&mdash;at least to that extent.</PARA>

At last week's ministerial forum meeting at Mt Hagen, I reiterated that position. I made clear our willingness to make available our good offices and our resources to facilitate such talks if it were thought to be helpful by all relevant parties. At the same time, I re-emphasised Australia's quite strongly held view that Bougainville's problems cannot be solved by purely military means and that there is a need for the Papua New Guinea government to take positive steps to bring the various groups involved in the conflict together for talks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murphy for his continuing interest in the problem. There is in fact plenty of evidence to suggest that hoarding of medicines is continuing. One does not have to look too far to find it. In 1992, as an example, approximately six million prescriptions were dispensed in February compared with 17.5 million in December.

The area of the scheme most rapidly increasing is that for non-cardholders because the general patients safety net increased by over 100 per cent in 1992-93. Obviously, we cannot allow that to continue. Consequently, a couple of measures are planned to address it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the Health Insurance Commission will be running an education campaign to make people aware of the dangers of the practice. That education campaign has the support of the peak professional bodies and the consumer bodies, including the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. More importantly, from 1 January 1994, as I am sure Senator Herron is aware, there will be a single safety net threshold of $400 for general patients. Once that threshold has been reached, there will be a charge of $2.60 for further approved prescriptions for the rest of the year. Concession cardholders still remain eligible for free pharmaceuticals when they reach their safety net, so we are talking about those people who do not have that concession. The Health Insurance Commission will introduce compliance activities and will administer them, I hope, in such a way as to protect those people who have privacy concerns about this issue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have all jurisdictions in support for an international transfer of prisoners scheme. But all is not perfect, of course. The Northern Territory has reserved the right to opt out of the scheme. But to the extent that agreement is necessary, we have achieved that, and the scheme can now be developed. There are good humanitarian reasons for such a scheme and good prison administration grounds for such arrangements. These schemes do operate overseas, and they operate well. A number of countries have already been pressing Australia to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme will allow Australians serving sentences overseas to serve their sentences in Australia. It will also allow foreign citizens imprisoned in Australia to be repatriated to their home prison system when there are demonstrated community ties. The next step in developing the scheme will be a report by the group of officials working on the details of the legislative and administrative framework delivered at the next SCAG meeting in February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage it is envisaged that, in order to be transferred to Australia, amongst other things the prisoner would be required to be an Australian national who has a minimum of six months of his or her sentence remaining to be served. In addition, both countries, the prisoner and the Australian state receiving the prisoner, would all have to agree to such transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order for this scheme to operate successfully we do have to link with international mechanisms.

Firstly, it increases the numbers and, secondly, it dramatically changes the composition of people who get access in terms of geography and socioeconomic distribution. The people who could never otherwise get to see what is being offered and what their taxes are subsidising get the opportunity through this activity. It was a fantastic performance and I am delighted that the ABC does this and I wish that commercial television would do it more. Of course, it does provide important access to Australian drama, and I also welcome that. That is the first point, and I thank Senator Zakharov for raising that point because that is important and I hope that more will be done in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern I want to draw attention to is what seems to be lacking in the commercial sector. When we think of the breadth of interest amongst Australians in cultural activity&mdash;particularly in view of the recent statistics about more Australians going to art galleries and museums than to the major football codes&mdash;it is interesting to note that what is lacking is information about Australia's cultural life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an explosion of information in the print media. I am delighted to say that our major newspapers are producing more and better coverage of arts and cultural activities, but it is still significantly lacking in commercial television. I hope that commercial television will look at the potential audience and the commercial opportunities available to it, as well as the social responsibilities it can discharge by doing it. It is denying its audience access to this important information and missing an important opportunity. I hope that it will reconsider its attitude and give more coverage to this sort of material on commercial television.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in question time, Senator Vanstone asked me a question about the Australian Protective Service. The Minister for Justice has provided the following advice: the suggestion by Senator Vanstone that morale within the Australian Protective Service at the joint defence facility base at Nurrungar is low and that relations with defence personnel are difficult is unfounded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that earlier this year there were some internal personnel problems within the APS which led to an investigation in May by Chief Superintendent Lacon, whose report was mentioned by Senator Vanstone yesterday. At Easter time this year the APS played a major role in dealing with demonstrations by the peace movement at Nurrungar. This involved some 700 demonstrators, 150 of whom were arrested by the APS during the demonstration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Department of Defence does have confidence in the capacity of the APS to fulfil its role of protection of the joint defence facility at Nurrungar. The internal organisational difficulties of the APS contingent at Nurrungar earlier this year did not affect its ability to protect the facility, as evidenced by its performance during the Easter demonstrations at Nurrungar and Woomera. Senior officers at the joint defence facility are currently satisfied with the performance of the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that he is further advised that the Director of APS is satisfied that both morale and operations at Nurrungar have now improved substantially with the actions which he has initiated, combined with further close management attention which together will ensure that further improvement occurs.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) to a question without notice asked by Senator Reid this day relating to home nursing care for veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister confirmed that the department has in fact rewritten its guidelines, the effect of which is to reduce the amount of nursing care at home that a veteran can receive. I wish to make some remarks about the way this is done and what it in fact means, and refer in particular to one case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would in passing remind people listening to the broadcast and those honourable senators here that a carer gets a pension of $8.10 per fortnight for full-time care of a veteran at home. The sum is such that one would almost think that it would cost more than that to administer and send that amount out every fortnight. Its inadequacy for the job that is being done is very apparent indeed. I would also remind honourable senators of the amount it would cost to keep a veteran in a hospital or even a nursing home if the care were not able to be provided at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case to which I particularly wish to refer, it is fortunate that the veteran's wife is a former trained geriatric nurse. So she is able to do a great deal more for her husband than might otherwise have been the case. However, she is now 83 years of age and she has been the full-time carer for her husband for nine years. He, having had both legs amputated, is not able to care for himself. What I find absolutely remarkable is that after nine years, when the carer is now 83 years of age and the veteran himself is nine years older than when this started, the amount of nursing care received at home has been reduced by 13 per cent. One would have thought that after that length of time it might even have been appropriate to increase it. I also mention that the nurses who attend often stay for longer than the time that they have now been told they will be paid for because of their recognition of the needs of the family that I am speaking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister to have his department look a little more compassionately at the needs of the people it is supposed to be helping. It might be said that perhaps some of this could be made up with respite care. There is provision for respite care. In the case I am referring to, the whole of the year's allocation for respite care for this family was used up in one go when the 83-year-old carer whom I mentioned had a triple bypass. So there is no more respite care available for the rest of the year. It might be said that it is a one-off case, but they are real people attempting to survive by having the veteran remain in his home, cared for principally by his 83-year-old wife. They are now having the nursing care component reduced, which makes it extremely difficult for this to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point I made earlier: the cost of having this veteran in a hospital or nursing home would be a great deal more than is being provided at present. I have no objection to the department being careful with the money being allocated for the purpose to make sure that it is not being used unwisely, but the department should at least look at a family, when it is examining the needs of a veteran, as a whole unit and take some account of the capacity of the carer to continue to do what she has been doing for nine years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total picture should be looked at to make sure that where there is a situation such as this, where the whole of the respite care allocation was used up while the carer underwent major surgery and then, astonishingly, returned to her job as full-time carer, the respite care component is continued during the year on a fortnightly basis, which is what should occur. The one-off allocation for the surgery that she underwent should have been an ex-gratia grant of respite care to enable the situation to continue. They want it to continue like this, but the pressure being placed on them at present means that it may not be able to continue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the specific case that Senator Reid has raised, I am happy to progress that with her privately. I think that is an appropriate way for us to proceed in that instance. I believe that the services that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is providing to our ageing veterans and war widows are appropriate services. I believe that we are particularly sensitive to the changing needs of veterans and war widows in our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Reid knows, in many forums that we both attend where veterans, war widows and representatives of ex-service organisations are present, I do stress the nature of the challenges that governments and ex-service organisations will face in the future. Currently, 30 per cent of our veterans and war widows are aged 75 years and over. By the turn of the century more than 60 per cent of our veterans and war widows, our entitled beneficiaries, will be over the age of 75 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that the sorts of services that Senator Reid has referred to will, I think, become more important to veterans' affairs beneficiaries. Senator Reid is also right to point out the fact that the profile of carers receiving carers pensions will also change. Not only are the beneficiaries getting older, but the carers in many instances, as Senator Reid knows, are getting older also. I think Senator Reid ought to acknowledge that our programs are very much focused on the importance of the health and the independence of Australian veterans and war widows. We are committed to seeing veterans and war widows, wherever possible, remain in their homes and remain independent for as long as possible. Their health and their independence is of vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to deal with Senator Reid privately on the specific instance that she mentions. I do not believe it is appropriate that we talk about individual cases in this procedure of taking note of answers to questions without notice. I give Senator Reid a commitment that I will have a discussion with her and look closely at the individual case that she refers to. But, from the surveys that we have conducted within the Department of Veterans' Affairs about our client needs and attitudes, many of these trends that have been identified in Senator Reid's questions are obviously occurring more broadly across our ex-service community, as has apparently occurred in the one case that Senator Reid mentioned. They are important challenges for the future. There is a need for our services to reflect the changing nature of the veteran community&mdash;the fact that we have an ageing community. This government has been committed, and will remain committed, to ensuring that the repatriation health care services that we provide are most appropriate to Australian veterans and war widows into the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bishop this day relating to the allocation of sports funding.</PARA>
<PARA>The question I asked today was a serious question which highlighted the matters that had been dealt with, in part, by Senator Campbell's question which drew attention to the double standards of the government in dealing with public administration and highlighted the work that my colleague Peter Costello has done concerning the Auditor-General's report and the maladministration of grants into Labor marginal seats for political advantage. I quote from the Auditor-General's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Department plays a significant role in the administration of the program the assessment and selection of projects to be funded is made by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>The report further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that in the latest round of approvals the Minister's office asked for details of the electorates in which the applications were located but was not prepared to put its request in writing when asked to do so by the Department, willy nilly can only lead to speculation about the basis for the selection process.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says that the documentation did not show the justification for approving one application in preference to another, and that is the basis of my question. The request was made by the Cromer Junior Rugby League Football Club to build an amenities block, which is to be used by members of the community to prevent the need to cross a busy road to use the only amenities facilities available&mdash;the facilities at the local service station. The application was for $55,000&mdash;not a cent was forthcoming. In Mrs Kelly's letter to Mr Carlton she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately due to the large number of eligible applications received, many worthy projects were not able to be supported. The club's project was deemed eligible for funding. At this time, there are no plans for further applications for grants through this program to be sought. However, should additional funding become available through this or similar programs, all local government authorities and federal members of parliament will be advised. I regret that I am unable to be of further assistance at this time.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that the Auditor-General's report finds that there was no documentation to show the justification for approving one application as against another. I asked in a supplementary question that details be made available to justify why in the Labor marginal seat of Richmond, which was held by the government&mdash;and just&mdash;there were no fewer than 11 grants made, totalling at least $166,730. They were made to the Brunswick Byron Netball Association Inc., which received $12,000; to the Brunswick Heads Bowling Club, $6,000; to the Brunswick Heads Surf Life Saving Club Inc., $10,000; three grants in Ballina; and more grants in different parts of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put these in context, I draw attention also to other grants that were made in preference to the one being made to Cromer. There was one made to the Mount Gravatt Workers Club, which has had some notoriety. A $200,000 grant had been made to the club, which is in the marginal ALP seat of Moreton in Brisbane, before the club had even been formally established by a public meeting. No approval for the club's proposed sporting complex had ever been issued by the city council. The club committee included the ALP member for Moreton, Garrie Gibson; the former ALP Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Clem Jones; and the local state ALP member, Laurel Power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the Auditor-General stresses that there is no legitimate documentation to say why one grant is made and another is not. The point is that in the seat of Mackellar not one cent by way of a grant was made available, yet in those areas where there was a political advantage to the Labor party the grants were made. I am simply saying that the Senate is entitled to know why one electorate is totally disadvantaged at the cost of not having a facility which is much needed and how political advantage determines public administration and how public money is spent. </PARA>

Instead of looking at the quality of its candidates and the quality of its policies, the opposition is trying to find a conspiracy or some other reason why it lost the unlosable election and lost the unlosable seat of Richmond.

We have asked the minister to provide details of those 906 cash advances so the Senate can determine whether there has been a breach. It is incumbent on the government and the minister to table details of these cash advances&mdash;not next week or over Christmas when the Senate has adjourned but today, if possible, or by early next week at the very latest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In addition to the cash advances that my colleague was speaking about, evidence has also come to light of public servants using their taxpayer-funded Australian government credit cards for such things as weight reduction clinics, chocolates&mdash;it seems strange that someone is spending on weight reduction while someone else in spending on chocolates&mdash;surf wear, sunglasses, footwear, five-star hotels, furs, musical instruments, records, CDs, grog, country club membership, flowers and plants, horse riding lessons, speedboats, jewellery and clocks, museums and art galleries, takeaway food, hairdressing, lingerie, home brewing kits and duty-free purchases. The list of things that have been purchased with these cards is unbelievable. I will be interested to see whether the government can explain why it has let this practice continue&mdash;obviously for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter of great concern is that $3 million worth of taxpayers' money has gone in interest foregone. When I look around at the sorts of programs that are needed&mdash;especially in my portfolio area of senior citizens and aged care&mdash;I see, for instance, the number of carers looking after people with dementia. That $3 million could well have been spent in that area. Many Australians in the community&mdash;the more than 11 per cent who are unemployed and those who are struggling to buy things on their credit cards this Christmas&mdash;will, I am sure, be asking questions about how public servants were able to purchase the items on these lists. I hope the minister can come up with some answers. This government could not organise a chook raffle. It cannot look after Australian taxpayers' money, and I think this exemplifies that fact. </PARA>

Many of those cards do not have limits. For instance, for three officers of the Department of Industrial Relations and Worksafe Australia the sky is the limit. Others in the Department of Defence and the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services have plastic cards with a buying power of $800,000&mdash;although mostly they are between $2,000 and $50,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)That the composition and powers of the committee be determined by a subsequent resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very difficult matter; possibly one of the most difficult pieces of legislation to come before the Senate in years. Nobody disputes that. Furthermore, it is a piece of legislation which very few Australians understand anything about. I do not think that that is disputed. There is wide community uncertainty about Mabo&mdash;the case itself&mdash;and the government's proposed legislative response to the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising out of that uncertainty there is also considerable community disquiet. There is a feeling of uncertainty and worry in the community in relation to this matter, particularly out in rural Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland and even in my state of South Australia. Of course, there is also political uncertainty in the state of New South Wales, whose government is now opposed to the federal government's legislation. Likewise, the state of Victoria and the Northern Territory are opposed to it and, of course, the Western Australian state government is strongly opposed to it and has legislated an alternative approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it seems to us that this government should be only pursuing its legislative option in this place with great care and after considerable community consultation. In relation to a matter which in effect has so much potential for destroying social cohesiveness, one would have thought that the government would have gone out of its way to build a community and political consensus to the most desired legislative response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone accepts that there needs to be a legislative response to Mabo because of the uncertainty that has been caused as a result of the case and the fact that there are still so many issues that were not clarified by the High Court in its judgement in that case. There is a whole range of legislative responses that could be made. The government has chosen one particular course. We argue that it has chosen wrongly, and we see the Western Australian government, for example, taking a very different response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, back on 23 November we gave notice that a select committee should be set up to go out into the communities in rural and regional Australia&mdash;not just the capital cities&mdash;and contribute not only to building greater public understanding of the Mabo issue, but also hopefully building greater confidence in a particular legislative approach. We would suggest that that is a very sound and sensible approach to be taken by the federal parliament. In addition, it would result in a much more informed debate even within this place when the select committee reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government rejected that option. It rejected the possibility of such widespread community consultation. It has argued that its very limited consultation with select industry groups, state governments and select Aboriginal representatives is adequate. We strongly dispute that position and strongly argue that, if ever there were a piece of legislation that requires much greater public support to be carried than it has at the moment, it is this one. The government says that if we delay it for that public consultation, the fragile consensus that exists at the moment might evaporate. We would say that, if all the government has is a fragile consensus, then it should not be pursuing the legislation at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there were a need for a piece of legislation to be built on a sound foundation rather than a fragile consensus, the need exists with this piece of legislation. We are disappointed that the government is not prepared to allow the committee process of this parliament to take place to try to build that sound foundation towards a legislative response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, through that process we would have argued that there is a better legislative response. Our position is well known. Basically it is not to usurp the traditional and constitutional functions of the states in relation to land titles and to permit the states to operate in that traditional area of responsibility, subject to the High Court's decision and relevant Commonwealth legislation such as the Racial Discrimination Act. This is a very sound, logical and constitutionally valid alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have had the opportunity through the committee&mdash;there is no secret about this&mdash;to have sought to build greater community support for that option. That debate and that educative process would have been helpful. We might have lost. The chances are we would have lost, when we look around this chamber, but at least we would have given the Australian people the opportunity to be part of this legislative process and we would have ensured a more constructive and positive debate in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative given by the government was to allow the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs just three days of hearings. What we will hear from the members of that committee this afternoon is that that was simply an inadequate amount of time in which to do the job properly. I am confident that they, or certainly those who have put down a dissenting report, will tell us that the individual people of Australia and the groups that they spoke to in the three cities that they were able to visit&mdash;Darwin, Perth and Brisbane&mdash;wanted more time for debate and wanted the select committee to be set up for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report tells us that there is serious constitutional doubt about the government's bill. It tells us that there are many Aboriginal groups who are unhappy with the government's chosen response, and are particularly unhappy that they have not been given the opportunity to be properly informed as to that response or to put their position.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will tell us that the mining industry in this country is worried about the loss of investment. It will tell us that pastoral interests are concerned about the security of their title and their livelihood. In other words, it reinforces that grave uncertainty within the community, an uncertainty that could be overcome by this select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that we now find that the Greens are not prepared to support this process. I am amazed that the Greens in their press release say that it is a travesty that the government wants to push this bill through in the last week before Christmas to become law without the community better understanding it. Yet they are not prepared to allow the process of the parliament to take place whereby there could be another two months of detailed consideration in the community. I just cannot understand the logic of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats, of course, announced that they would support the government's response even before the government had announced the detail of its response. So they were locked in from the past. This is just another example of how closely aligned they are with the Labor Party&mdash;sometimes we think even driving the Labor Party. But that is their chosen lot and we are therefore not surprised to see that they do not want the Australian people to have a greater participation within this legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved the motion because we on this side of the chamber think that it is important that this select committee go ahead for the reasons I have just given, and so that a greater community understanding can be built up on a very difficult and controversial piece of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition's motion simply is not designed to improve the government's native title legislation. Rather, it does nothing more or less than play into the hands of those who have yet to come to grips with the reality that the High Court has recognised a new form of title in the common law of this nation and that what we are about, as expeditiously and as sensibly as is possible, is implementing that in law in the way that creates the maximum degree of certainty for the maximum number of people within the shortest possible time, which is manifestly very much in the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who remain troubled about the consultative process that lies behind this legislation let me describe just what has gone into it. So far as the consultation process which has preceded the parliamentary consideration or the Senate consideration of it is concerned, it needs to be said as follows: over the past 18 months there has been an absolutely unprecedented degree of public discussion and debate on the issues raised by the Mabo High Court decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first place, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation distributed a booklet called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Making things right</EMPHASIS>&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">reconciliation after the High Court's decision on native title</EMPHASIS>, some 200,000 copies of which have in fact been sold through the Australian Government Publishing Service outlets. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;ATSIC undertook a major public publicity campaign among both Aboriginal communities, which is, of course, its particular responsibility&mdash;responding to those interjections&mdash;and the wider community. Some 27,000 copies of an information kit prepared by ATSIC in terms that should be readily understandable by ATSIC's particular constituency were distributed. More recently 5,000 copies of a plain English guide to the bill, as it is described, have also been distributed by ATSIC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government itself very early on established an open and transparent process for responding to the Mabo decision. We established an interdepartmental committee which undertook wide ranging discussions, not just with itself but with those in the community who had a major interest in the outcome of this legislative process. It set up a ministerial committee to work through the issues. A discussion paper was released under the authority of that committee for public comment in June of this year of which 6,000 copies were enormously widely distributed. A comprehensive outline of the legislation, as it then stood in our minds, was released in September 1993, as a focus for public comment and discussion. I think nearly 3,000 copies of that particular outline were distributed. Some 3,000 copies of the bill itself and explanatory material associated with that have been distributed since the bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives some time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the bill was preceded by a very detailed process of negotiation and consultation with Aboriginal interests, the states and other relevant interests, including, of course, the pastoralists and the miners. That is something which none of the state or territory governments which have introduced native title bills have been prepared to do. So do not let us hear any yelps and squawks from Northern Territorians or Western Australians in this particular consultative exercise because nobody has been through the kind of process that we, the government, have been through on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now there is the Senate committee report itself before us. Members of the committee will no doubt speak about that, and it sounds as though there may be some competing views&mdash;that is not unusual in the history of Senate committees when a certain partisan stance is to be taken. But what needs to be acknowledged is that in the time available, limited as it was, an extremely thorough and comprehensive inquiry into all aspects of the proposed operation of the Commonwealth bill has in fact been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the committee on the thoroughness and the quality of its work in the time involved. I think it is a really remarkable effort. It travelled to Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia and it received, read and considered 109 written submissions, as has been made clear in appendix 1. It heard evidence from a wide range of sources, both within the Aboriginal community itself&mdash;although it sat only in capital cities, under the auspices of this particular process it did hear people visiting those cities from a number of outlying communities&mdash;and it heard people from a whole range of other interest groups. My quick count of the total number of witnesses appearing before the committee in its four days of hearings in Brisbane, Darwin, Perth and Canberra was a total of 149 witnesses&mdash;all of them with something to say, all of them with relevant interests to represent and advance. Their voices were heard. That is not a flimsy, superficial or quick and dirty exercise. That itself represents&mdash;quite apart from all the rest of the consultative processes that I have already mentioned&mdash;a major effort at listening to people's responses to the terms of the legislation and involved far more consideration than most legislation gets in this place, as all of us who have been here for longer than five minutes would readily testify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report, after assessing all the evidence put before it, has recommended in favour of the early passage of the legislation. In particular, the majority report points to the highly detrimental and discriminatory impact of the Western Australian Mabo legislation on Aboriginal people in that state. It points to the potential breaches of Australia's international obligations arising from that legislation and it points to the urgent necessity of getting Commonwealth legislation into place to get a little bit of justice into the statute books to remedy&mdash;to redress&mdash;that situation that has now been created by the bull-headedness of the Western Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now say something about the debating time that will now be available to deal with this bill in this chamber. This is another relevant consideration if we are talking about references to select committees and the need for dispatch or the absence of dispatch in terms of parliamentary consideration of it. There will be ample opportunity for Senate debate on the Native Title Bill. We programmed more time for this bill&mdash;almost the whole of next week&mdash;than has been the case for any other bill, or indeed the total package, in the budget sittings program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other bill for which any remotely comparable amount of time has been programmed is the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which seems likely to take in total two full sitting days. Putting that in context, we have spent in the vicinity of 140 hours so far on legislation in these sittings and by the end of this week we will have dealt with a total of 112 bills which works out, on my quick calculation, at an average of just over one hour and 10 minutes per bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have programmed for the Native Title Bill approximately 20 hours for debate in this chamber during the second reading and committee stages. If we achieve that, if we go that distance, that should represent about 12 per cent of the total time that has been spent on legislation in these sittings. We will have spent 12 per cent of our time on one bill and there is a total of 112 bills, or 70-odd different packages of legislation, that we have dealt with in this session.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been given the consultative time and attention it deserved in the whole very complex and elaborate process leading up to the introduction of the legislation. It has been given a reasonable amount of time and attention by the Senate standing committee legislative scrutiny process&mdash;in fact, much more through that particular process than I can recall being given any other piece of legislation. It has been given, and it will be given, an ample amount of debating time in this place to enable us to deal with not only the general principles of the bill, but also, as I know many honourable senators want to do, particular, substantive, detailed proposed amendments to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It cannot be assumed that the reference to a select committee would result in a report back to this place some time around 21 February, as is proposed by the current form of the motion. We all know that there is not going to be any realistic opportunity to put substantial time and effort into a select committee exercise in what remains of December when we get up or in the month of January, because life is not like that in Australia; it never has been. Whatever the determination of the committee might be to work through the period of January, it is highly unlikely to be able to get access to the range of witnesses that would be necessary to add any significant new dimension to the Senate's understanding of this legislation that has not already been contributed by the excellent work that has been done by the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be also said that while much of the public debate on this whole Mabo issue has been constructive, there has been a tendency for some elements in the community to be destructive and divisive in their contributions.

The kind of process of reconciliation, of building consensus, of building support for an understanding of the rights of Aboriginal people, of building an understanding for some principles of justice and principles of decency at last to be applied for these people who have been so sadly neglected, that consensus, that process of reconciliation, is fragile and that would, I am afraid, be very seriously prejudiced by any extended process of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Delay will place added strain on the reconciliation process between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. This is the very last point that needs to be made: I fear that further delay would also exacerbate tensions within the indigenous community, particularly between those indigenous people who stand to gain from the High Court decision because of their continued association with land in some shape or form, and those who will not, by the nature of their longstanding dissociation from land, so benefit. We want to avoid that kind of division. We want to promote harmony, reconciliation and consensus. This particular exercise will not only not contribute to that; it will operate very directly, very immediately and very hurtfully against it.

The point is that the opposition has not had the opportunity to be involved in the detail of the negotiation. I suspect that it does not even know the Aboriginal people who have been involved. The point of saying that is to define for the opposition who represents the Aboriginal negotiating team, because it does not appear to know. First and foremost, there is ATSIC.

But they have said all along and clearly that the legislation is workable and that it represents a huge step forward&mdash;a bigger step than they have ever taken before, because in this country we have walked away from land rights debates time and time again. To say that there has not been sufficient consultation with Aboriginal groups because the people who have been involved are not representative is untrue and borders on the offensive.

Senator Evans and some other people on his side&mdash;sometimes picked up by the chair, other times not; I am not looking at you, Mr Acting Deputy President, implying that you are a culprit in that respect simply because you happen to be in the chair&mdash;have been waving the racist rattle as hard as they can in trying to say that, if anybody on this side or anywhere else happened to disagree with the government's response to Mabo No. 2, if they thought there was a different way to go, they must be a racist.

The Greens understand that it is an indictment of our political and parliamentary system if there is not a thorough review of this legislation'. I got down to the bottom of the release and found that they are basically saying, if I understand the position of Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette, that there might not have been proper consultation, that the bill might not be in a proper form and that there are lots of people concerned about it. But down at the bottom do they not really say, `But guess what: if you agree to what we want, we will let it through anyway'?

We find them later and we think we are big joes because we fix these drafting errors. I think the Deputy Clerk of the House of Representatives has written at some length about the list of bills that one might find at any one time that have been passed through this place but never proclaimed because, after we thought they were okay, someone found out that something was wrong with them so they were never proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a wide range of reasons why this happens. I invite honourable senators who served on that committee to take notice of their own report which basically says that the parliamentary system would be greatly improved&mdash;I am not talking about the notions behind, in this case, Mabo No. 2, or the considerations and general discussions prior to the bill coming in; but once a bill is established&mdash;if the committees were given a proper chance and proper resources and if parliament took the time to get all of the detail right. That is the first point. We say: this is so important, get it right the first time. Do not muck about with it and do it afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's view is that the fragile consensus will disappear over Christmas. A fragile consensus is a very fragile foundation on which to be building the sort of legislation that we want. In my view, those people who support this type of response should take the time that a review would allow to build a stronger consensus. They should not be so weak-kneed and lily-livered as to simply say that they cannot do any better at building a consensus than has been done thus far. I know you are looking at the clock, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am doing my best. I am not far from finishing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I think I have covered the fact that the review procedure is completely inadequate. We know that the Selection of Bills Committee is designed to send detailed and complex clauses of bills to standing committees so that outside experts can address them and give us some advice. That procedure is not designed to consider the broad range, broad brush issues at all. We used that procedure because it was the only one available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our dissenting report, honourable senators will see the very long list of amendments that people suggested. We do not say we agree with all of them; but we do say that there is a lot of detailed consideration which has to be responded to. If this is to be debated next week, we look forward to seeing how each of the people who think that this legislation should be shoved through by Christmas will respond to those amendments and what they will have to say about each of them in detail. If the legislation is shoved through, I personally look forward to the debate that will ensue next Christmas when we will have to amend it. I hope the people who have participated in rushing the legislation through will be here when we need to amend it so that I can give them what they richly deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point the government makes&mdash;I think the Democrats make it also&mdash;is that we have to get this through because we want some certainty in land title management in Australia. There is no certainty coming out of this bill. This is dead set for a High Court challenge. I will not take the time now to list the matters that we, and a number of other people, say are constitutionally doubtful in this bill. But they cover such things as interference with the capacity of the states to carry out their functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people say that the bill should be held to be invalid due to vagueness because it is an attempt to take over common law that has not yet been established and, in particular, to do so in relation to section 109. But that is a point for people who are fascinated by constitutional law, so I will leave it at that. There are other concerns in relation to the role of assessors, for example, and whether they are taking on some sort of judicial role. Some detail of that is to be found in our dissenting report. Suffice it to say, there is no certainty coming from this legislation. It is dead set for a High Court challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost last, but not least, it is an extraordinary irony that a large group of Aboriginal people in the community are still saying, as they said to this committee, `You people still think you can say what's best for us without fully listening to us'. I do not deny that representatives of significant portions of the Aboriginal community have been listened to. I do not deny that at all. But I hope those who participate in this debate will also not deny that plenty of people in the Aboriginal community do not think that they have been listened to at all on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last, but not least, there were serious concerns raised by commercial interests. They are dealt with last. I have tried to deal with the substantive ones which I think we should be primarily concerned about now. But let us not forget that there are significant commercial interests to be looked at in this respect. They relate to the mining, pastoral, fishing, tourism and forest industries. These industries provide jobs for non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal Australians. We need to get it right in that respect as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess it depends on one's point of view. Senator Panizza is obviously very uneasy about the views of Mr Chaney. Mr Chaney, a former minister for Aboriginal affairs&mdash;and therefore a most credible witness&mdash;in his compelling evidence, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suppose my chief concern as an ex-member of the Senate is that I do not want the Senate Committee system used as a Trojan Horse for prejudice, and I think there is every risk that that would be what would happen if we had a lengthy Senate inquiry. I also do not want to see what I think was an important symbolic gain for the whole Aboriginal community in the Mabo decision thrown away.</PARA>
<PARA>I restate that comment about a Trojan Horse for prejudice. Senator Hill, I believe, has quite good intent in putting forward his terms of reference for the select committee. He says that it is to report on or before 1 February. I suppose if one were not familiar with the Senate committee system&mdash;which we all are&mdash;one would think, `Well, that seems reasonable. Select committee, it's got to report by 1 February, what are they worrying about?'. But he then proceeds to give us the terms of reference. Let us look at them: a, b, c, d, e and so it goes on. There are 13 points in his terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, is it really possible that such a detailed inquiry, an inquiry that Senator Vanstone and Senator Hill have emphasised is so important to get to the detail and to reconsider all the issues that the government has been considering now since the High Court brought its decision down in June 1992, can be conducted and concluded by 1 February? We all know that that is not their intent. Their intent is politically motivated; they are intent on delay. They want to give the opponents of the legislation time to gear up in the same way as in the totally discredited campaign of the mining industry in 1985 against national land rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any talk that it is reasonable to have a select committee inquiring into it is totally rejected, and rejected by someone who should know&mdash;Mr Chaney. Although I do not wish to upset Senator Panizza further, I will quote Mr Chaney again. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, the early passage of the Commonwealth legislation will bring to an end the political and industry campaigns designed to inflame public opinion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>So much for Senator Vanstone, who was accusing Senator Gareth Evans of having a silver tongue in some of his comments about racism in the community. Mr Chaney agrees that these campaigns are designed to inflame public opinion and to force the federal government to abandon any defence of any Aboriginal property interests, because of electoral consequences. Anyone with a knowledge of the history of the last 10 years could not deny that that is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad but true that many people in the community do not understand the High Court decision and are suspicious and fearful. The most important feature in bringing an end to that uncertainty&mdash;if I can use the word we heard so many times during our committee hearing&mdash;is to put in place legislation that will start to show that native title tribunals will not mean the sky will fall in Western Australia. They will start to put in place realistic justice in implementing native title; no more no less. It will be modest legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second person I would like to quote is Mr Caston. I know members of the coalition have brought in a dissenting report and have questioned constitutional issues. That is their prerogative. However, they have to ask themselves who, in the whole country, might know something about constitutional issues. Mr Caston QC, who was very much involved for 10 years in representing Mr Eddie Mabo in the High Court, has talked about the legal complications of the Western Australian legislation and any delay in the passage of the federal bill. Mr Caston said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I can translate the political battle into legal terms, the reality is that you are going to have a legal nightmare if the Western Australia bill is going to operate, so to speak, in defiance of the federal bill. The federal bill will override but the legal tangle will grow, as the time gap grows. It is the delay and the Western Australian law that will render things unworkable, not the operation of the federal bill.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that we have heard from so many groups in the community, particularly industry groups&mdash;and bankers commenting on investment, although we did not hear from them in our hearing&mdash;surely we do not want this kind of uncertainty and legalistic nightmare. We need legislation that is the responsibility of the national government because this is a national issue. We need it put in place as soon as possible. We certainly do not need to have this legislation referred to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I put forward an argument in favour of urgent passage for the Commonwealth bill, stemming from the commencement of the Western Australian legislation. Sir Ronald Wilson, President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, has said that the Western Australian legislation has put Australia in breach of its international obligations. In particular, Sir Ronald referred to the obligations binding Australia, contained in article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of a Child; article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination Of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; articles 2, 7 and 8 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights; articles 2, 26 and 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; articles 2.2 and 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and articles 4 and 6 of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and those people who are still convinced that this legislation should be referred to a select committee, `Can Australia, which has a fine reputation as an upholder of human rights, afford this kind of breach? How long can we let our reputation suffer from this form of breach? Can we really allow legislation to go off to a committee, to be hidden away in a committee for months&mdash;perhaps years'?</PARA>

In this instance, that would be very destructive for the Native Title Bill. It would certainly be very detrimental to economic certainty in this country. It would inflame racism. Senator Evans was very particular in his comments. He said quite clearly that he was not talking about any senator here.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already stated it will not support the legislation. It argued that it is unconstitutional. I would like to reply to that. If it is unconstitutional there is a grave question over the government's own legislation. The clauses of this Native Title (Status Quo) Bill were taken from the government's bill, based on clause 11, and were the inducements to people to rely on the federal legislation to actually protect people from state government legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government's motives in not supporting the legislation were much less pure than concerns about its constitutionality. I believe it simply wishes to rush through this legislation so that any time for real scrutiny and reflection is gone and it can get away with passing a piece of legislation which discriminates against Aboriginal people while the facade of justice remains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been more than happy to allow the fear generated by this issue to work in its favour. It simply wants to use the quickest, simplest and least inconvenient way of acquitting itself of finding justice for Aboriginal people. Meanwhile, the opposition, which urged the Greens to be involved in reference to a committee&mdash;the Greens expressed some willingness to do that for very positive purposes&mdash;was also unwilling to support the opportunity that the bill presented to assess the federal legislation properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is urging us to support reference to a select committee to inquire into, and allow greater consultation on, the federal bill. But if it was not able to support the Native Title (Status Quo) Bill, its motivation for wanting a delay is in question. It is quite possible that the opposition would not be displeased if the government lost its desire to present ground-breaking legislation in the place of rising public opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen the committee process in operation.

On balance, a further committee reference is unlikely to achieve our aim of providing a positive opportunity for Aboriginal and Islander people to be consulted and to come to a greater understanding of the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry exposed two things. First, I do not believe anyone can argue that this bill is understood&mdash;not by the very people who drafted it and certainly not by the people whom it will affect, the Aboriginal people of my state of Western Australia. Secondly, we have to accept that there is a wide diversity of views&mdash;and justifiably so&mdash;amongst Aboriginal people on this issue. The politicisation of views was another reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are two main reasons for not supporting this referral. Firstly, the committee process would not necessarily have been able to provide an improvement on the legislation or the consultative process. Secondly, the politicisation of views I have already referred to means that those who really want social justice have been directing all of their attention to the urgency of debating that instead of directing their attention to the content of the bill. We believe our decision, which was a very hard one, not to support this reference will enable the very high energy level&mdash;deflected by the government onto the Greens to knock us over or to pull us into line&mdash;to be effectively directed at the content of the government's legislation. The government will have to wear the responsibility for the legislation. It also has to show how this legislation matches the Prime Minister's words contained in his statement regarding its aims&mdash;towards justice for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone asked me to explain the last part of my press release when I said that, by making this decision, we accept that there is a need for consultation; but by making this decision we are in no way endorsing the government bill and need to see major amendments agreed to by the parliament before we will be willing to pass it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone queried me on those comments. She asked whether this meant I was only interested in my views being put to improve the legislation. Although she is not here, I will answer that query. I believe that I have a right to be able to put my views, as do the other members of this parliament. Regrettably, many people in Australia cannot put forward their views, but it is important to reflect those views. If the government's legislation had matched the words and the bottom-line positions of the Prime Minister that were first indicated when he was negotiating with some of the Aboriginal people, the Democrats and the Greens, we would have been happy to support the legislation. Because that has not happened we are unhappy and in no way can our endorsement be guaranteed. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just listening to K.L.C. on this Mabo thing we don't know where we stand, and if the Government put K.L.C. in charge of the land where does that leave the real Aborigine, I think we be worse off. Look what they like now, what it be like in another 4 or 5 years, people in the Kimberley know nothing now, even people we known all our lives they used to call themselves white people, then they realised they could get more money calling themselves Aborigine. They race to Canberra without we know and talk to Keating saying our tribe sent us, we know nothing, and Keating swallow all that, because he doesn't know, he just listening to the one man, then when they get back to the Kimberley we don't know what Keating said. Only people that come to talk to our face was Graeme Campbell and Dr Hewson mob.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why doesn't Keating get someone to come round to tribal people and talk to them, he find he get a lot different story . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what an elder and a senior lawman said. But this government, in its patronising fashion, says, `We know better'. There is mammoth ignorance in the Aboriginal community, in the Islander community and in mainstream Australia, not just about this legislation, but also about the whole ramification of the Mabo problem and the decision of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that we had to grapple with&mdash;and I do not believe we could properly grapple with it&mdash;was the consequence of the legislation which has been presented before us. All sorts of guarantees and undertakings were given to the  people who met with the Prime Minister in the lead-up to this legislation being put together. The government is concerned because all of those undertakings are about to unravel. People are suddenly finding that Mr Keating, in his inimitable fashion, has promised them one thing and will deliver another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, for example, says that the traditional owners of Aboriginal land are not good enough to hold the native title if it is determined in their favour, because it has to be put into the hands of a corporation. What sort of a corporation will that be? We do not know, because it is not in the bill. It is not in the bill, but Mr Keating puts his hand on his heart and says, `Trust me'. With the track record that he has, he says, `Trust us on this one'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many traditional Aborigines say that this is not acceptable. They say it is not acceptable that the native title rights that they are supposed to enjoy will be put into the hands of a corporation. Government senators can say what they like about the corporation being merely all of the traditional owners put together. We know, and they know, that the corporation will be run by corporate rules and corporate laws. The compensation that gets paid to corporations ends up in the hands of the directors to deal with as they wish. We know the track record of some of these corporations. That is why people like Mr Billy King say that they do not trust the Kimberley Land Council. There are a lot of Aborigines like him, and we ought to respect that view. We ought to take the time to consult with them and look to see whether there are better ways in which this problem can be solved for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other manifest defects in this bill. For example, the government made promises to the primary industries and to the forest industries of this country that pastoral properties and forest areas would be protected. Yet on Monday, 6 December we found the government's own advisers admitting that this bill fails to give the protection that the government promised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts, obviously does not understand, for example, that in the forestry industry, especially in North Queensland, many of the timber-getters are Aborigines. We are talking about their job opportunities and the job opportunities of their children and their grandchildren. One of the witnesses in Perth spoke about exactly that sort of thing. He said, `Unless there are jobs and opportunities for our children and our grandchildren, then we cannot progress as a people'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not create jobs and opportunities we get two streams of people in this country: the people with the opportunities who live in the cities and the people who live outside the cities with no opportunities, no jobs and no hope. As a country we cannot in good conscience say that jobs, opportunities and hope are reserved for people who live in the cities. We cannot condemn generation after generation of Aborigines, and other people who live outside the capital cities, to life with no hope, life with no prospects, life with but despair. That is what we run the risk of doing unless we recognise that there is a real need to create those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill fails to create jobs. This bill fails to give any security, for example, to the timber industry. In the state of Queensland we find that timber leases, forestry leases, are not agricultural or pastoral leases and therefore fall through this giant crack in the legislation. But we are told, `Don't worry about that; just get it through before Christmas. Just put it through before Christmas and maybe people will forget about it while they have their Christmas roast'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really frightens me that that is the attitude we get from the government because the manifest defects in this bill are repeated in the state bill in the state parliament because it imports all the same defined terms, all the same flaws and all the same fallacies and does nothing to create harmony, opportunity or consensus. If we have a legislative framework that says that every time a pastoral lease comes up for renewal, every time somebody wants to go ahead with a timber project and create jobs we all have to rush off to a court or tribunal, that does absolutely nothing for harmony and it does nothing about bringing Australians as a whole closer together. All it does is drive divisions between Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the witnesses in Perth was very eloquent. He said, `I was one of those Aborigines who was kicked in gaol; I was one of those Aborigines who had to get a permit to get married; I was one of those Aborigines who was not allowed to walk along the verandah in front of a pub&mdash;I had to step out onto the street. I wasn't allowed onto the verandah because of the colour of my skin'. He said, `I have been there and I've lived it, and I don't want to live it again'. He said, `I've got all the chips off my shoulders and I don't want to pass them on to my children and my grandchildren or they will grow up in the past&mdash;not the present and not the future'. Yet, for the sake of getting the legislation through before Christmas, they are the sorts of divisions that we will create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not even have a uniform system across this country. We will have one set of laws in Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, and another set of laws in the Northern Territory with completely different expectations and completely different obligations. We will have one category of Aborigine in the Northern Territory and another category of Aborigine in Queensland or in Western Australia. There will be one set of rights for one group here but another set of rights for another group there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is such historic legislation, why can it not be historically uniform? That seems to be impossible because we have to rush it through before Christmas. What is the only offering we get from this government? It says, `Let us have a monitoring committee'. A monitoring committee to me sounds like an enormous waste, an enormous fob-off, an enormous excuse so that the government can send around a whole lot of people to find out what was wrong with the legislation in the first place&mdash;things that could have been found out had we had the select committee that this side of the chamber seeks today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address a few remarks to the motion before the Senate this afternoon. I do not wish to canvass all the ground that Senator Evans, Senator Reynolds and Senator Kernot did, but there are a couple of points that I think are worth making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I thought that, while the process was performed under some pressure, we did manage to take a great deal of evidence and see a great number of people in 4 1/2 days. I think it is important we get that correct because the figure that has been mentioned is wrong. We had a day of hearings in Brisbane, a day in Darwin, a day in Perth, a long day in Canberra and then a short session the following day. In my brief experience we had what was a reasonable amount of time to hear from all the groups that wanted to speak to us, and I think that was a worthwhile process. Obviously, as with everything else, more time would have allowed for a greater debate of the issues, but I think we allowed enough time for people to put their views to us both in verbal and written submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions about process have to be addressed because I think they have been used to cloud the debate a bit. The first remarks I want to make go to the views of Aboriginal people. I see Mr Mansell in the gallery tonight. I for one was impressed with his evidence on this matter because I think it was very important. He made the following point: why should Aboriginal people be expected to have a unanimous view about such an important issue? Why should Aboriginal people also not disagree strongly and have divergent political views about such an important piece of legislation as Mabo and the response to it? It is patronising in the extreme to expect one group in society to have a homogenous view of what is a highly political matter or of the strategies that ought to be applied in advancing their cause. So it is quite appropriate and quite natural that there is a range of views about what strategy and what response ought to be followed by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my comments about the consultation process, I make the point that the thing that swayed me most was the evidence to the committee from Mr Pearson. As one of the people who had negotiated with the government over this bill, he said that, in addressing this issue, he asks people of goodwill, `What strategy do you have that will improve the outcome for Aboriginal people if the matter is delayed?'. I found that to be a very telling question which he asked of his Aboriginal critics, asked of other critics of the bill and asked of the committee. He said, `What strategy have you in place that will advance our cause and get a better result for Aboriginal people than is provided for in this bill if it is referred to a Senate select committee and deferred to next year?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I addressed myself to that question with a great degree of seriousness. My answer was that there was no advantage for Aboriginal people from a delay and that they would not have their cause advanced; in fact, as the majority of the committee concluded, their rights were more likely to be diminished as a result of delay because of the political processes that would now come in train. The delay would prolong some of the campaigns that have started questioning the rights recognised in the High Court decision and encompassed in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Western Australian, I remember very vividly the land rights campaign conducted in Western Australia in the mid-1980s. It was the most disgraceful and upsetting political campaign I have ever seen. It sticks in my mind, as it does in Fred Chaney's, as one of the low points of Australian political life. It is certainly something that I am anxious never to see repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great myth seems to have grown up around this debate that more time and a greater understanding of the bill and the Mabo decision will somehow resolve the competing views in Australian society on native title. That is plainly wrong. The bill balances a range of competing interests. It would be nice to think, as one Aboriginal elder suggested to the committee, that we could use the Aboriginal way of talking and talking about a matter until a consensus emerges. However, I fear that we are not used to that process, and that it would not work in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competing interests of mining, fishing, tourism and farming conflict with the granting of native title by the High Court. In the same way as the bill recognises that, so too must we. The bill tries to find the appropriate balance. It is perfectly acceptable for people to say that the bill has not found the right balance; but let us not have the myth that somehow, by talking and talking about it, that the conflicts of interest will disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal critics have said that the bill does not fully recognise the rights granted by the High Court decision and does not go far enough towards enshrining Aboriginal rights. The committee also heard evidence from a number of different industry representatives, who said that the bill recognised rights that go beyond the High Court decision which, in any event, should not be granted to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This genuine conflict of interest requires a political solution. People can disagree about the appropriate balance but it is a real problem that has to be addressed by the parliament, and no amount of talking or deferral will resolve that issue. Some of the people who have entered this debate have chosen, for whatever motives, not to recognise that. However, the bill is about appropriately and reasonably balancing those conflicting claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have described the bill as achieving a fragile consensus. That description is probably right&mdash;it is a fragile consensus. Those people from each side who negotiated the bill had to give up some rights or attitudes that they took into the original negotiations and say, `We will take a step back to gain consensus'. The Aboriginal negotiators have conceded a range of issues to achieve a bill that they believe advances their interests generally but which does not meet all their demands. The same is true of the miners, farmers and other groups involved in the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill represents a fragile consensus because all of those interest groups are under attack, from both within their organisations and from outside, for going too far in giving up some of their rights or negotiating positions. That is real politics. Indeed, the Greens have been subjected to real politics over the past couple of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will argue that those who have shown leadership and have struck a deal have not got as good a result as they could have. Quite frankly, I have never been involved in any deal or agreement where that has not been the case&mdash;one will always be criticised for having done the deal. As someone who is well known for achieving well-balanced solutions which recognise conflicting demands, I am sure Senator Richardson would concur with these remarks. The politics are a fact of life and have to be dealt with. The government believes that the bill represents a correct balance of competing interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the opposition saying? Earlier today, Senator Hill referred to the Liberal Party's policy on native title. I am still at a loss to know what that policy is. I am not sure whether it is the Court government policy. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has improperly suggested that its Native Title Bill is the only appropriate response to Mabo No. 2. Any full inquiry should be asked to consider the serious State responses and the Coalition response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not sure what that means but I think the opposition is saying, `We want to reopen the whole debate about the approach to this issue'. That is fine, but the opposition should be honest and say that that is its aim. The opposition should not claim that its aim is to allow Aboriginals a greater understanding of the issues, because the opposition knows that the select committee will not do that, nor would the timetable allow it. Really, the opposition is talking about reopening the debate. Interestingly, there is no reference to any of those matters in the opposition's motion. There is no reference in the motion to the recommendations contained in the report. The motion pretends to deal purely with the questions that arise from this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue cannot be considered in a political vacuum. Opposition members have failed to address the WA legislation. The WA government has abolished native title rights in the state where, we all agree, this legislation will have the most impact and where the High Court decision will have the most impact. So we are not dealing in a perfect world where we have the luxury of time. I would be interested to hear those opposition senators who have spoken about consultation describe the consultation leading up to the WA act&mdash;describe the wide process of talking to Aboriginal people and the long process of consideration by the parliament&mdash;because such a description would be an interesting contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really have to deal with the political situation and address the issue. Those that argue for delay of the bill are silent on the WA legislation. Do they support that legislation or do they claim that it does not have to be considered? If opposition members are going to argue for the delay of this bill and for further consultation, they have to stand up and state their position on the WA legislation. It would be highly hypocritical of opposition members to urge delay and, at the same time, support those people who have abolished native title rights in Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It remains a travesty that the Government wants this crucial bill pushed through into law without being better understood&mdash;not just by those debating the bill in parliament, but by those whom it most deeply affects.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a compelling statement which I am reinforced in supporting by my experience in the last eight days as a member of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, earlier stated that some 200,000 pamphlets had been sent out; that ATSIC had embarked on an information campaign. That is all very well but the proof here is really in the pudding. We have to look at the people to whom that information was addressed. Having carefully considered this matter, I am of the view that a substantial percentage of the Aboriginal population do not have a clue about Mabo and not one jot of an idea about the Native Title Bill. For that reason, the coalition senators included in the appendix to their report a summary of the witnesses who asked for more time for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cast an eye over that list we see that a good many of those witnesses are Aboriginal. In fact there were additional witnesses from the Northern Territory who were left off that list, and I apologise to them for that oversight. For the record there was a Mr Rose, from the Australian National University; Mr Thomas, who designed the Aboriginal flag; Marshall Perron, the Chief Minister for the Northern Territory; the Northern Territory Chamber of Mines; Bishop Appleby, the Anglican Bishop of the Northern Territory; Mr Lawford, from the Airspace Committee; and a Mr Back, who represented the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The list includes in excess of 60 people from a variety of backgrounds who thought that there should be more time for consideration. That patently illustrates the fact that no matter how many pamphlets Senator Evans says were sent out, no matter what campaign ATSIC embarked upon, the campaign was not successful because, clearly, the message did not get across. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ron Caston QC, who represented Eddie Mabo in the historic native title case, stated in his evidence that a royal commission&mdash;styled along the lines of the Woodward royal commission&mdash;would have been the appropriate course of action. I endorse that comment. However, in fairness to Mr Caston, I point out that he also said that time had slipped by and that it was now too late for such action. He also supported the idea of the bill being passed by Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Caston was quite right in his comments about instituting a royal commission. Really, the blame for the sorry situation in which we find ourselves today lies at the door of the government. When the Mabo decision was handed down by the High Court in June of last year, that was the time to have ordered a royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take issue with the comments made by Senator Kernot and Senator Evans about the government embarking upon a consultative process. I dispute that there has been any sort of consultative process over the last 18 months. It has only been in the last six months that this question has been addressed at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those who say that there was consultation&mdash;I remember that Father Brennan said that there had been negotiations last year&mdash;to look back to the March federal election campaign and point out where this issue was raised in the press. No-one in this parliament could say that it was raised as an election issue because it was not. There was no consultation; there was no negotiation. This matter has only been raised in the last six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the greatest issues to affect Australia in the post-war period, yet a Senate standing committee was given not quite two weeks within which to travel around the countryside and report to this parliament. The four days of hearings were fruitful to some extent because the hearings highlighted the concerns people have about this bill. As best as they possibly could, the coalition senators annexed those concerns to appendix 1 to their report. Some 150 amendments were put forward by interested parties, from mining groups to Aboriginal groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns that the coalition senators have about this bill can be seen in the body of the report. Despite their concerns, the government insists on railroading this bill through the parliament. Despite the proposed amendments, the government insists that this bill be passed in order to avoid any further division within the community and to avoid any injustice in Western Australia. To address the government's attitude, I point out, firstly, that the conduct of this committee convincingly demonstrated that a Senate select committee could operate quite properly without creating a division. I entirely dispute the comments made by the former senator, Fred Chaney, that such a senate committee would be a Trojan Horse for prejudice. I say that because of the manner in which the inquiry was conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw miners, Aboriginal groups, pastoralists, all sitting at the same table. There was no acrimony between them although evidence was given in a most forthright fashion. It made me proud to be an Australian to see such a democratic process being carried out without rancour and without the violence we sometimes see in foreign countries. I therefore congratulate my colleagues on that committee, the staff who supported us and the people who participated in the inquiry. It was a credit to the country that opposing views could be put with such rational debate and with such rational propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore say to those people who believe that a Senate select committee would result in division and the problems that some say took place in the mid-1980s that they are wrong. This is 1993, and a different feeling is abroad in Australia. I was impressed by the way in which people with such differing views could sit side by side and discuss the matter. From the appendix to our report it is clear that opposing views can be rationally put. The whole process demonstrated that a Senate select committee could conduct a rational inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are successful in getting a select committee to examine this matter, I would like to see one of the Green senators on it. With both Green senators coming from Western Australia, they have a particular view to represent, and I believe that it should be put. I would wholeheartedly support one of them being appointed to sit on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for referring this matter to a Senate select committee is that there are problems with the bill. Any problems that people might have with the Western Australian legislation are best dealt with by the High Court, and I understand that a challenge to that legislation has been lodged there already. However, simply because some people think that the Western Australian legislation is flawed and should be challenged, that does not mean that we should rush in and wholeheartedly embrace federal legislation which could be fatally flawed constitutionally with national repercussions ensuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first problem that I see with this bill relates to the constitutional provisions. Professor Colin Howard and S.E.K. Hulme, two outstanding constitutional lawyers, have commented that there are constitutional flaws in this bill which could render invalid any subsequent legislation. If that is so, the repercussions would be catastrophic not only for the land management systems in this country but also for the people whom this bill sets out to help. One can imagine payments of compensation and grants being made under this legislation which might have to be revoked as a result of invalid legislation. And where would that leave us? It would put this country in a state of great division. We would certainly see Australia torn to pieces on social and racial grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the Aboriginal witnesses who appeared at the committee expressed many concerns. Their first concern was the vesting of native title in a corporation&mdash;clause 53 says that this can be done&mdash;against the wishes of individual native titleholders. That is completely abhorrent. Senator Spindler quite correctly picked up on that in some of his amendments. In fact, Senator Spindler, who was on the committee, has some wide-ranging amendments and I imagine that it would be difficult for him to support the bill unless those amendments were incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other Aboriginal concerns are in relation to the overriding of the Racial Discrimination Act. In our report we have outlined two areas where we believe the Racial Discrimination Act has been overborne. The Commonwealth can do that because this is a piece of legislation occurring later in time, but that was not the intent of this legislation, as I understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, there have been concerns from industrial groups. I note that under the heading of the mining industry we have listed the concerns of the mining industry. We have listed the concerns of the pastoral and agricultural industries, the flaw in the definition of past acts and the misunderstanding of how pastoral leases work in Queensland and Western Australia&mdash;the fact that they would have to be reissued and that the process would have to be gone through in the future. Whether that is a desirable thing or not is for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this bill says and what the government says is that there is not a problem and that this is not the case. The government is misrepresenting what the relevant clauses in this bill say. Quite unexpectedly the fishing industry raised some legitimate concerns and that was with the artificial definition of onshore. One would expect, when using the normal English language as we understand it, that onshore means on the land. Pursuant to this bill the word `onshore' would cover bays, estuaries, inlets and other waters within state jurisdiction. As a result of that, we have anomalies arising from the aquiculture in the north-west of Australia and the pearling industry. There were also grave concerns expressed by the fishing industry in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good many of the amendments annexed to this report are from Aboriginal groups. The coalition group in the Northern Territory, I think, would be responsible for a great many of them. I have also received suggested amendments from the Northern Territory government. Those amendments are at their respective ends of the spectrum, as one could understand. Nonetheless, they need to be entertained, they need to be aired, they need to be discussed and they need to be debated. But unfortunately, with the rushing through of this bill, that will just not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really what we are seeing here is a destruction of the democratic process. The coalition has already made its position on the Mabo decision quite clear. The Mabo decision is accepted. Native title has been decided by the High Court and it has been accepted that operation of the Racial Discrimination Act is entirely appropriate and should continue to have application. Having said that, I take great issue with those people who say that the opposition's agenda is to delay the matter so that this bill will crumble and fall aside. I say to people who say that: if we really had the intention to do that I would be on the government side applauding this bill and pushing it through, because it is the biggest legislative joke I have ever seen. It will crumble. It will fail. And if I really did want to mess up the system, if I really did want to be mischievous, I would be on that side of the chamber supporting this bill. It is going to fail and I bet London to a brick that when it gets to the High Court it will do so. We as senators have a responsibility to pass good legislation&mdash;good at law&mdash;which is valid, which will be upheld and which abides by the constitution of this country. In relation to this bill, there are too many queries as to its validity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot accept the criticism of the coalition, that it is our design&mdash;our nefarious design&mdash;to delay things so that we might derail and destabilise this Native Title Bill or at least the sentiments behind it, more importantly. We have a High Court decision and it has to be acted upon. We cannot just pretend that it is going to go away. We cannot hide it under the carpet. The High Court has made a decision and we need to respond to it in an appropriate fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I put to those detractors that no matter what happens there has to be a response. At the end of the day we cannot leave it without a response. We owe it to the people of this country to find a legislative response. The Western Australian government has taken what it sees as its legislative response. Perhaps if this government had acted more responsibly the Western Australian government would not have been cornered as it was by the federal action. To the people who criticise the Western Australian legislation, I say this: look at it carefully and see exactly what that legislation does, because that legislation will, of course, be under scrutiny just as this legislation is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is perhaps a difference here and that is that the Commonwealth government has maintained the high moral ground in saying that it has the answer to the Mabo decision; that it knows the answers. It said that it is contained in this Native Title Bill. Well, it just is not, and that is the thrust of my submission to the Senate today. If it were a proper response, we would not be having this debate here today. If there had been proper consultation, we would not be here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whilst a large percentage of the population and the Aboriginal community remains in a vacuum as to whether this is a good bill or a bad bill or as to what Mabo actually means for them then I believe we just cannot pass such legislation without full inquiry. I believe that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has made an adequate start for any Senate select committee, which could be a foundation on which to build an inquiry. As Senator Evans said, it might have only several weeks but at least the lion's share of the work has been undertaken in the legal sense by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I believe the select committee could take it from there and come back with adequate recommendations at the next sittings in the new year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to please my colleague Senator Panizza by quoting from Mr Chaney and also from Mr Campbell in a reference that was made to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its inquiry into the Native Title Bill, which is not the subject of this debate here this afternoon but nonetheless is a very important subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do that, I want to pick up the point made by Senator O'Chee in his contribution to the debate when he quoted from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> evidence given by Mr King. The evidence given by Mr King was later answered by Mr Peter Yu, who is the Executive Director of the Kimberley Land Council. Mr Yu said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is highly unfair and insulting to the executive of the Kimberley Land Council who are represented by many of those 30 or so different language groups, traditional people&mdash;people who are very senior, and very strong in their law and culture. There may be political differences that the gentlemen at the other end of the table have, and we respect that. We have tried to accommodate the interest by approaching them to sit down in negotiations. If people are not prepared to sit in negotiations and consult, I am not sure how you resolve it.</PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that would put the quote used by Senator O'Chee earlier into some degree of context. We still live in a democratic country and people can choose not to be associated with decision making. However, when they choose not to be associated with decision making they then should not go to the extent of criticising decisions that are made. Unfortunately, we have seen a number of instances of that occurring a number of times through the course of what was a relatively short but in terms of hours and input a very exhausting, a very lengthy and a very detailed inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now satisfy my colleague Senator Panizza by quoting the two gentlemen I mentioned earlier. It is a direct quote from the Senate committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Friday of last week, page 444. Mr Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My reason for giving evidence was my concern that history would seek to be re-enacted, or they would seek to re-enact history by building up public feeling against any notion of Aboriginal rights in this state, to the point where political action would become impossible through the parliament. I am fortified in that view by the comments made by the member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, in the second reading speech in the House of Representatives, where he made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be possible that, for once in their lives, the Greens will do something useful. If they can lock this up in a committee for any length of time, I believe public opinion will steamroll this bill and it will be consigned to the garbage bin of history where it belongs.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Mr Chaney was making a lot of sense. I think all Western Australian members of parliament, be they federal or state members, know that there is a racist campaign being beaten up in Western Australia at the moment. It is a campaign which we were reminded of a number of times during our visit to Perth. We remember the campaign during the 1980s and we look back on it with regret. I am sorry if I am embarrassing anybody in the opposition, but I now show the Senate a poster that was placed outside polling booths right across Western Australia in 1986. The posters were put there by Liberal Party and National Party campaigners. Those opposite cannot wash their hands of it now. Their party was intimately involved in a dreadful, racist campaign in the 1980s. It cannot be allowed to be repeated in Western Australia or in any other part of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are at the cliff edge of it happening now. The advertisements and letters are appearing in our newspapers. I bet it is not only those on this side of the chamber who are receiving those disgraceful, disgusting letters that make one ashamed to be a political representative of Western Australia. We cannot try to hide from it: there is racism in our society and sometimes it raises its ugly head more often than at other times. I certainly hope it does not happen. If this bill were deferred for a month, two months, five months or, more realistically, 12 months, so that a select committee could do its job, our society would completely break up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have witnessed&mdash;much to the shame of the particular organisation concerned&mdash;a rewriting of history. We should perhaps be addressing the report of the parliamentary committee that looked into this matter rather than Senator Hill's motion, because that committee received a submission from the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia. It was submission No. 5 and it has been published. I quote from page 4 of the submission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would appear to be entirely fair for compensation to be paid where anyone is deprived of property rights or right to enjoy some title or facility as provided for in the current Western Australian Acts, however the right to compensation for loss of perceived rights where entitlement or title has not been established is quite another issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For past acts the question would have to be decided on whether the granting of pastoral leases deprived aborigines of the right to use the land. In Western Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory, aborigines were not removed from the land . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate that the Pastoralists and Graziers Association of Western Australia said this to a Commonwealth parliamentary committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . aborigines were not removed from the land until Commonwealth laws were passed in the seventies making it mandatory to pay award wages and granting full social service benefits. This forced the stations to pay only those who qualified for full wages and others to remove to where full benefits were available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the early days aborigines congregated around the station homesteads because life in the bush was harsh and brutal; for prolonged periods sustenance was near to starvation level, and station owners provided rations&mdash;it was easier to come in out of the bush.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a disgraceful submission by any standards. In 1993, to put forward such a statement to a Commonwealth parliamentary committee, knowing that it would be made public, to rewrite history in that manner, is disgraceful. I could use stronger words about it, but I will refrain from doing so in order to observe the gentilities of this place. But it gives us an indication of views that are prevailing in our society. </PARA>
<PARA>That a senior officer and respected community citizen in the form of Mr Boultbee was prepared to put his name to such a scurrilous statement as this without any sense of fear says a lot about our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people forget&mdash;unfortunately, many of the Aboriginal people both in my home state of Western Australia and particularly those who gave evidence on the east coast of Australia&mdash;that last week Western Australia passed into its laws an act of parliament which removed native title for Aboriginals in Western Australia. It did that with such urgency that for the first time in over 100 years the guillotine was applied in the upper house, in the Legislative Council. It was the first time that the guillotine has ever been used in that house and it was used in order to remove native title, to overturn the High Court decision. The guillotine was not just applied once; it was applied twice. On the second occasion there was a multiplicity of amendments put forward that were not even subject to debate because no time was allowed for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is how serious the issue is and that is how confident the Court government in Western Australia is that it can push through, and get away with, what will clearly be recognised by history as racist legislation. It can do it; it did do it. In one-third of the land mass of Australia, native title has now been wiped out. That is one of the reasons for the urgency of the legislation that the Senate will be debating next week. One of the reasons why that legislation must be brought in is to protect those Western Australian citizens who have been deprived of their rights through that action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by giving a further reason why this motion before the Senate should be defeated and why the bill should be carried next week. I quote from evidence given to the committee by Father Brennan, a Catholic Jesuit priest and Australian citizen who said in his opening comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is sometimes said that I am an Aboriginal advocate, but I am not. There are more than enough Aboriginal advocates here who would take the view that my views on these things are often on the side of conservatism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is what he said about himself. On page 532 of the Senate committee <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 6 December he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, what is to be put in its place and, secondly, what is to be done for the benefit of native title holders, particularly in Western Australia, who stand to suffer most because of the Western Australian legislation? It would seem to me that there is no Aboriginal group that will lose out from this legislation and there are Aboriginal groups that stand to gain from legislation of this sort being passed.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is a very convincing argument by a very respected individual who I do not believe is a conservative. I do not necessarily agree with everything that he says from time to time; nonetheless, I respect his right to have a view and to profess that view, as I respect the right of Mr Boultbee to have a view and to express that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I do not think anybody has the right to distort history in the way that Mr Boultbee has done. I condemn him for that and I condemn his organisation for allowing him to do it officially on its letterhead. I further condemn the organisations which have joined with interests in the mining industry and other organisations in Western Australia to finance advertisements in our media that are whipping up anger, bitterness and hatred against the most deprived class of people in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join this debate briefly this afternoon and refer to the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, to refer the Native Title Bill to a select committee. This legislation before the parliament is fundamental. It is of great importance for all Australians, especially Aboriginal Australians. The motion put forward by Senator Hill is worthy of very serious consideration because of the import that it sets out in the proposed terms of reference and the matters that should be examined by the particular committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are only two aspects that I want to address this evening. I will leave the other comments very logically and correctly until next week's debate on the Native Title Bill when the Senate will be considering that in obviously a lot of detail. But, in pushing for Senator Hill's motion today, I want to stress two points and two points only. The first issue is the interests of Aboriginal people, with whom I am very familiar in my electorate. I am not wishing to be descriptive in any way when I describe them as traditional and ceremonial Aborigines. They have a very important stake in this particular legislation. The second issue that I want to address relates to the constitutional relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. To me, Senator Hill's motion goes to the very fundamental core of the interests of those two particular groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent very proudly the Northern Territory electorate. Thirty-five thousand people living in my electorate are Aboriginal or of Aboriginal descent. A very significant proportion of those people are traditional Aborigines still living in remote, isolated communities and carrying on, what can probably be described as, a ceremonial lifestyle that has very great significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs visited Darwin last week, an excellent presentation was given to the committee by the Rev. Dr Djiniyini Gondarra, the executive officer for the Northern Regional Council of the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress. Dr Gondarra went into a lot of detail with regard to the specifics of Aboriginal law and how it would impact. One of his advisers, Mr McMillan, in backing up the comments made to him, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are describing to you a system of law which is perhaps far greater than the draftsman of this bill or than the non-Aboriginal people of this country believe it to be.</PARA>
<PARA>The issue was raised very fundamentally that the Native Title Bill did not address that situation. That is a debating point. It is very significant and important for those traditional Aboriginal people of Arnhem Land, elsewhere in the Northern  Territory, in Western Australia and in Queensland to have those issues properly addressed. The way in which the committee and this parliament, in its haste, are now dealing with this legislation, I find to be very patronising and to be very wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware that when two cultures are trying to communicate, there are exceptional differences that have to be addressed. Often we do not make that proper appreciation, in a legal sense or in a political sense, in accommodating that very important issue in dealings between two cultures. I am fearful that of the 149 witnesses that appeared before last week's committee&mdash;whom Senator Chris Evans identified&mdash;less than a handful were full-blood Aboriginal people still living in and linked to their traditional and cultural ways. That is a great shame. I do not call into question the bona fides of any witness and I appreciate that many of the Aboriginal people who appeared had good intent. But many of them do not reflect the interests of full-blood Aboriginal people and there is often very fierce debate within the Aboriginal community about the issues and how they present them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I became familiar recently with an excellent article by a school teacher in Arnhem Land who back in 1987 prepared a very good document that looked at the cultural differences that school teachers had to address when they went into traditional Aboriginal communities. Whilst this was prepared for a teacher, let me just quote a couple of points that need to be taken into account because I think they are vitally important and will be essential to both this debate and the debate next week. This document stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In yolngu&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Aboriginal society&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is bad manners to be too curious or inquisitive, and yolngu passively resist answering too many questions because it goes against their notions of independence and privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yolngu children generally do not experience in their own culture the use of questioning as a teaching technique or the question-and-answer technique of transferring knowledge. It follows that yolngu cannot understand why a teacher is asking questions when she knows the answers. (There is one setting in yolngu society where they do ask questions when they know the answer&mdash;that is when they are angry and make a loud speech in public. Here one of the techniques of verbal challenge is to `ask' rhetorical questions such as, `Do you think I don't know what you've been doing, eh?' These questions are never answered, and children expect not to have to answer similar questions from teachers.) This simple inability to understand the function of the question as a teaching technique is enough to reduce children to a confused silence.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder, Mr Acting Deputy President, whether you have experienced that in meeting and talking with many Aboriginal people. The paper goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hypothetical questions are an even worse problem, because they are never found in yolngu speech. Even if yolngu are asked an hypothetical question in a very real setting and it has immediate relevance so that they seriously tried to understand it, they still often misunderstand because they transpose the hypothetical setting to a literal setting. For example, if you ask, `Would you rather have a banana or an orange?' and the answer is, `Orange', it will be assumed that you have an orange and a banana right there to give away.</PARA>
<PARA>Similarly, there are issues that deal with shyness. It covers the issue of how people deal with social norms. The paper goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yolngu will sometimes answer what they think you want them to say. For example, they will say, `Yes', when they know the right answer is `No', but they think you hope it will be `Yes', just to avoid the possibility of direct verbal confrontation or the likelihood of further questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you are in the habit of phrasing a question in the form of alternatives in English, it might prove fruitful to slow down and work out one alternative at a time.</PARA>
<PARA>In a Senate committee system, we tend to engage in all of those activities. As I said, my concern is that at last week's hearing there were fewer than five traditional Aboriginals giving evidence. Whilst there were many other representatives, many of them had political and correct representative agendas that may not necessarily reflect that important bit of the traditional Aboriginal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the issue that I think needs to be addressed by a select committee is this constitutional relationship between Commonwealth, state and territory governments. Mr Acting Deputy President, you referred to that matter of the Western Australian legislation and that is on one side of the political spectrum. On my own side from the Northern Territory point of view, there is an important act of this parliament&mdash;the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act&mdash;which  bestows rights that go further than that of the Native Title Bill that will be debated next week. That will produce tensions and issues that ought to be, and should be, properly resolved to ensure a consistency in the benefit of all people. That relationship between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory is terribly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next generation of Australians and Aboriginal Australians will feel for years and generations to come the repercussions of what we do in this parliament next week. I would have thought the Greens would have been much more attracted to an inquiry over the next month or two that pursued those issues and set that relationship right so that there was not the opportunity for conflict, tension or racism to rear its head. Unfortunately, I am of the view that the bill currently before us will exacerbate, rather than assist, that problem. I hope that the Greens will reconsider their position and support Senator Hill's motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He always does, as the august minister who sits in front of me says. On several occasions, we have heard those opposite say that one of the problems with the inquiry is that there has not been enough consultation. I remember when the corporations legislation came before this parliament the claim was made that there had not been enough consultation and that more should take place. The question is not whether more consultation could take place but whether enough has. I can only reiterate on that point the telling remark made by Senator Kernot, who said that in deciding whether enough consultation has taken place we should look at not only the discussion that has taken place in the committee but also the discussion that has taken place over years&mdash;which she plays such a central part in&mdash;between the Aboriginal citizens of this country and other members of this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been massive consultation over the years. It is said that somehow that position will be improved if, over the January holidays&mdash;that is the holiday season; it is a very Australian custom to have holidays in January&mdash;such consultation takes place as will, according to speakers on the opposite side, bring agreement with the various groups affected by the Mabo decision. That is clearly not so because the difficulty with the Mabo decision is that it brings into play a whole range of conflicting interests which can never be reconciled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem with which we are faced. When we listen to the miners talking about how the proposed legislation will affect them, they put forward very valid points. When we listen to the pastoralists, so do they. When we listen to the commercial fishermen, as you did so intently, Mr Acting Deputy President, they have a good point. Of course, so do the Aboriginals. Everybody feels they are entitled to their rights and, in the ideal situation, everybody should be given their rights, but conflicting rights can never be reconciled. They will not be reconciled by a quick inquiry. It will have to be a quick inquiry. As I understand it, the committee will have to report back on or before 1 February 1994. It is impossible for that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought Senator Chamarette made a most moving speech in this chamber. Clearly, she has had to face some very hard issues, which she has resolved. The resolution of those, of course, is not easy. No doubt we all feel the tensions that arise in a situation such as this. But, in the end, our system of government is such that the parliament must make laws that are proposed by various people. The bills might be proposed by a private member, by government and so on, but in the end we have to make a decision. We cannot, and should not, resile from our responsibility to do that. Now is the time for us to consider the bill, and that will be done next week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process will not be the end of the fight of the Aboriginal community in this country for justice. This is a very historic occasion.

<PARA>I glanced through this Australia Council annual report with considerable interest. My eye was drawn in particular to the community cultural development program, particularly to the amount of money which flows to the trade union movement via Australia Council grants. I find it difficult to accept without great concern&mdash;ironically in the year of the federal election, a year in which the trade union movement spent a considerable amount of time, money and effort re-electing the Labor government&mdash;that so much money is flowing to the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it utterly inappropriate. A major issue of propriety is in relation to the use of the Australia Council as a vehicle for expending a vast amount of money on the trade union movement which, patently and obviously to the people, has enormous and significant sums of money at its disposal, and which were used quite blatantly to re-elect the Labor government back in March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 99 of the annual report has a section listing trade union programs which get a total of $166,000. Above that, trade union arts organisers get a number of grants totalling $62,000. Among the other extraordinary items under this program are other union grants, buried away almost as though they were deliberately hidden in other grants. There is something called national networking&mdash;I have no idea what that is&mdash;for which the Trades and Labour Council of Queensland got $15,000. There are performance projects. The trade union choir of South Australia got $6,000. The total was $40,000 or $50,000. There is promotion&mdash;field initiated, with more grants to trade unions. There is resource development&mdash;field initiated, with more grants. The Australian Railways Union of South Australia, the Food Preservers Union of South Australia, the trade union choir of South Australia and the Waterside Workers Federation are all getting thousands and thousands of dollars of grants under these extraordinarily obscure programs&mdash;under the Australia Council's auspices. It is quite inappropriate for taxpayers' money to be used to fund these various activities of trade unions, particularly in a year in which thousands and thousands of dollars of trade union money has been used to re-elect the Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA>The 96th report of the committee is the annual report of the committee for 1992-93, describing the operations of the committee during the year. In this time the committee was particularly active, scrutinising a record 1,652 instruments, tabling four reports and making six special statements. Action by the committee improved the quality of delegated legislation, evidenced by the many amendments of instruments made by ministers and others to meet its concerns. As a result of this cooperation from ministers, it has now been more than five years since the committee has felt obliged to recommend the disallowance of an instrument of delegated legislation. The committee is grateful for the support it received from all senators during the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that this legislation is designed to override the mandates that were given to a number of states in recent state elections. A clear mandate is about to be given at the South Australian state election. I am very familiar with the situation in Western Australia following the last election; I am not so familiar with the Victorian situation. But, certainly in Western Australia, the issues of industrial relations and its direction were very high on the list of issues that were debated at the last election. Some pretty scary campaigns of total deception were run during that election&mdash;from the north to the south and from the east to the west of that state. Even with those scare campaigns, the Western Australian people voted very clearly for a change in direction after 10 years of Labor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment compels the commission to take into consideration those industrial relations issues. The amendment is not saying that we want the commission to be unfair to people in the workplace, but it is asking the commission to take those various aspects into consideration. It is very frustrating for the people who voted in those elections&mdash;whether they were employees, employers, or in some other category&mdash;to now find that this government, backed by the Democrats, is moving to a position where it will override the states' mandates. The amendment makes only a small change, but I believe it is necessary in order to cater for the situation that exists in those states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a federation, as a federal parliament&mdash;particularly as a Senate&mdash;we have a responsibility to take those factors into account. The amendment is not trying, as was suggested by Senator Bell, to overturn the intent of this legislation. It is giving a little more flexibility and is taking away some of the rigidity. It will prevent moves towards centralising everything in Canberra which, in the long term, can only be detrimental to the various states&mdash;my state in particular. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We certainly did talk about it. In fact, it was a very major issue. Senator Chapman might not like to acknowledge that, but it certainly was a major issue. In addressing Senator Crane's amendment, I think what he is losing sight of is the fact that the Commonwealth legislation will not override state legislation where the state legislation meets the requirements of those international obligations. Where state legislation is seen to comply with the obligations as they relate to ILO or other conventions, the Commonwealth legislation will not override it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard Senator Bell refer to the no disadvantage rule. What I have to say will be of interest to Senator Margetts as well because I will give a couple of examples. This happened in New South Wales. A Sydney based company reached an agreement with its employees to work four 10-hour shifts each week, for a number of reasons. One reason was to make it more flexible for its employees. Another was to maximise capital utilisation. More importantly, according to the company, it was to reduce the company's energy bill. The company was prepared to pay wage increases to supplement the change. It was agreed that a shift allowance of 30 per cent under the award be reduced to 15 per cent. The union intervened and refused to be party to the agreement on the basis that the cut would be a reduction in national standards.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is interesting that Senator Murphy interjected because the other day he made the point that&mdash;I am going off the subject a little, but the sort of nonsense we get from Senator Murphy gives me an opportunity to respond to him&mdash;if people were to become more productive, how on earth could it increase employment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy has raised the issue of International Labour Organisation conventions with regard to the amendment moved by Senator Crane on behalf of the opposition. I simply want to make the point that the fact that ILO conventions are being used to impose uniform minimum standards in this country simply reinforces the need for the amendment moved tonight by Senator Crane. I believe it is highly dangerous for us to be using ILO conventions in terms of establishing domestic law&mdash;both as a nation and indeed, as Senator Parer mentioned, as a Commonwealth of states. As an independent nation, surely we can legislate for our own requirements without relying on International Labour Organisation conventions and recommendations, which in fact may or may not be constitutional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more importantly, we need to recognise that the states are sovereign in their own right and that it ought not be the practice of this Commonwealth government to use the external affairs power in the way it is in this legislation to ride roughshod over the states in their jurisdiction. It is only through the use of these ILO conventions and recommendations that the federal government is able to do that. In this way we are of course sacrificing the sovereignty of Australia to an international organisation. If this situation were not so serious it would be laughable. As my colleague Senator Kemp has said on a number of occasions in this chamber, the number of United Nations and international conventions that this government is agreeing to and using as the basis for legislation in Australia is quite laughable. On the one hand the government is doing that but on the other it is arguing that we ought to become a republic because we need to express greater independence. The government is so inconsistent. If those opposite cannot see that, something is wrong with their logic. We are quite capable of determining our own legislative needs without relying on those conventions or sacrificing our independence in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the more important issue is the way in which these conventions are being used to ride roughshod over state sovereignty within what ought to be state jurisdiction. That is particularly so where state governments have recently obtained a mandate for their policies with regard to industrial relations. Senator Crane has already pointed out the way in which that has happened in Western Australia. In South Australia, the Liberal Party has very clearly spelt out what its approach to industrial relations will be when it wins government on Saturday. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for this government implementing the means of riding roughshod over that new government's approach to industrial relations by the use of the ILO conventions and recommendations. That is exactly what it will be doing by using&mdash;or, should I say, abusing&mdash;the external affairs power in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing that the government is not only riding roughshod over the states but it is also the very antithesis of what it says this legislation is designed to encourage&mdash;which is greater flexibility and a more enterprise based approach to employer-employee relations. The very antithesis of that is setting down minimum national standards when the very essence of enterprise agreements is to have variations based on the individual needs of individual firms and also individual regions. Those opposite are denying the opportunity for variations between states that ought to be the essence of a freed-up approach to industrial relations. There are differences between regions; there are differences between states. The agreements that are reached between employers and employees ought to have the capacity to reflect those differences. But, again, that will not occur because of the way in which these international conventions are being used to ride roughshod over states rights and state jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that we will not obtain the flexibility that this country desperately needs in industrial relations. Different regions will not have the capacity to improve their local productivity for the overall benefit of Australia's productivity and for the improvement of the living standards of all Australians. It is on that basis that this amendment ought to be supported and incorporated in this legislation, to at least water down to some extent the way in which this government is using or, as I said earlier, abusing the external affairs power to impose uniformity on the states. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view across the board of the people who provide those jobs&mdash;the people who make the investments, whether they be big companies, medium companies or small businesses&mdash;is that this particular piece of legislation will be a disincentive to investment, which means a disincentive to employment.

If he was referring to federal legislation, there is no capacity under the current act for national standards to be reduced&mdash;varied, yes, even as it stands now before we finally get to the new bill&mdash;but we cannot reduce award standards either in certified agreements or under any other aspect of the current Industrial Relations Act. The commission could not do it. What the union was actually saying was quite correct. Whether the union said it or not, if the agreement was sought to be registered in the federal Industrial Relations Commission, the commission would not have been able to do so because the act, as it currently stands, would not have allowed that to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make quickly is that, with respect to Senator Parer's condemnation of our seeking to implement ILO conventions, we, along with I do not how many countries, are, in fact, members of the International Labour Organisation and it is a representative body, as pointed out by Senator Bell, made up of employer, government and opposition representatives, state and federal representatives, et cetera.

<PARA>That is exactly what we are seeking to do. That is what we said at the last election we would do. That is why, as Senator McMullan has pointed out, we sought to maintain flexibility and fairness. Those opposite, in neither their policy nor anything that they have said in this debate here tonight or in the committee in terms of the question they raised about employment, have not given any examples of how their policy or anything that they have said would increase employment. It would not. The fact is that we had that obligation and what we said at the last election is that we would uphold it. As the minister has pointed out, what those opposite seek to do is nothing short of reducing the conditions of work and the wages that people in this country earn.

With respect to helping to prevent and eliminate discrimination in our society, a glaring inconsistency exists in the Industrial Relations Act 1988. This occurs in section 113(2B). That allows discrimination against women to continue in awards if it is `in the public interest'. We consider this exemption to be a remnant of a bygone era. The Sex Discrimination Act does not require the commissioner to take into account economic or other factors in determining whether or not discrimination should be allowed, so why should the Industrial Relations Commission be allowed such leeway?

Mr Temporary Chairman, you may remember that from your industrial days. The company was actually sued because it would not put women in an area where there was a very high lead concentration. It knew, as everyone else knew, that it was highly dangerous for females who could potentially become pregnant to work in such an area as their children could be affected. I think it is only in the last three weeks that a decision has been made that enables the company not to employ women in that area of the mine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both Senator Harradine and Senator Parer have raised an issue that reflected my initial reaction to the amendment. It is something about which I wished to reassure myself. I tried to address it in my initial comments in response to the amendment, but perhaps I was too cryptic. There are two safeguards against those concerns that have been raised and I will also make a further comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first safeguard, of course, is that section 113 arises only if the Sex Discrimination Commissioner chooses to refer a matter to the Industrial Relations Commission. It seems unlikely that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner would choose to refer something which was discriminating positively in favour of women. That is the first hurdle&mdash;not of itself probably sufficient to reassure us, but it is a significant first element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element&mdash;and I do not have the legislation in front of me&mdash;is that, consistent with other measures such as the Racial Discrimination Act, my understanding and advice is that there is a similar special measures provision in the Sex Discrimination Act that enables discrimination that is in favour of women in this particular instance; that is not, therefore, considered discriminatory in terms of the Sex Discrimination Act. If something would not constitute discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act, it does not constitute discrimination under this section. So those are the two protections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view at the moment is that those protections are sufficient, but I did say&mdash;because I acknowledge that other people share the concern which Senator Parer and Senator Harradine have raised&mdash;that the government will continue an examination of whether we need a provision which allows positive discrimination or enables the remedying of a discriminatory award in a staged manner. On the advice I have at the moment, this amendment achieves the positive purpose that we all support without the negative consequences about which Senator Harradine and Senator Parer have apprehension. I am advised that we can be confident that that is the case, but to be absolutely certain we will conduct a further examination in case there is a need for some qualification to deal with that risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by Senator Crane. Anyone who has ever worked in the business sector, whether it be from the union point of view or the employer point of view, will know only too well that over the years unions have pressured employers to dismiss workers who refuse to join in a closed shop arrangement. It has been a common practice. There has been an example of that in our own state, and it is nice to see Senator Kernot in here, where in the last couple of months Reg Gordge, a 62-year-old concreter working on the Coolum project&mdash;it was being built by Curry-Kenny Investments; that is, Lisa Curry and Grant Kenny, two sportspeople in Australia&mdash;had just pulled his boots on when he was told he could not work unless he joined the union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the BLF and a lot of militant left wing unions work is to come along, as they did in this instance on the Gold Coast&mdash;I can quote other examples of this; it is not a single example&mdash;and say, `This is a construction site'. For those who are uninitiated, and a lot of small business people are, their question is, `What does that mean?'. The answer is, `It means that everyone on this site has to be a member of our union otherwise the site is declared black and all work will stop'. That is the way it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People can argue that that is not legal and all that sort of thing, but that is how it happens out in the real world. I had one small business person phone me up when this happened to him and say, `What do I do?'. I said, `Well, if you are a man of principle, you will resist it, but you will go broke'. An example is the Indy race at the Gold Coast, where the Queensland government was putting up the money for the work being done. Obviously, the business could expect no support from it, so the business paid up. The union works on the basis that the employer will pay to send it away. The union has no interest in the membership&mdash;the names of the people. A member could be called `Mickey Mouse' as far as it is concerned, as long as the money&mdash;a couple of thousand dollars&mdash;is paid over. In this instance, Reg Gordge said:</PARA>

<PARA>He learnt. They sent him off the job, all right. He also said that there was no sense in paying $136 in union membership fees when he only had three days work on the site. That is why earlier I made the point that the union would not care about that. It works on the basis that, when it puts the pressure on, the employer will often say, `Look, here's the money, so go away, leave us alone and don't declare the site black'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment prevents an employer from dismissing an employee for not being a member of a union. It does not affect the fact that, if someone is a member of the union, that person can stay on the job. There is nothing to prevent that from happening. It ensures that workers cannot be dismissed without redress, wherever they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the House of Representatives, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, claimed that the amendment was constitutionally unsound because it went beyond the specific grounds listed in&mdash;here it comes again&mdash;the ILO's convention concerning termination of employment at the initiative of the employer. The coalition has been advised that, due to the structure of the convention&mdash;it hurts me to talk about conventions because we do not believe in using overseas conventions as the basis for domestic legislation&mdash;the amendment will be constitutional if the government's termination provisions are constitutional.

However, he expressed reservations about the legal foundation for it, as Senator Parer described. Although Senator Parer feels uncomfortable about quoting ILO conventions, there is no doubt that the Commonwealth would not have the power to do this were it not for the ILO convention.

The balance of legal advice seems to be that it is something we can do, so we will accept the amendment, but we will have to have some further discussion and look at the law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the advice from the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services that the government is going to accept the amendment moved by Senator Crane on behalf of the opposition. Undoubtedly, without that amendment, this clause writes large the one-sided nature of this legislation. Without that amendment, this clause lists the grounds on which an employer cannot terminate the employment of an employee. Those grounds include membership of a union and participation in union activities. It excludes the prevention of an employer terminating the employment of an employee because he or she does not belong to a trade union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the essence of the amendment that has been moved by Senator Crane&mdash;to include non-membership of a trade union as a reason whereby an employer cannot dismiss an employee. That is a very important amendment to the legislation because it highlights the importance of the individual over the collective. Without that amendment, this clause, as originally drafted by the government, clearly elevates the collective over the individual. That demonstrates the priority of this government: it gives a much higher priority to the collective than it does to the rights of the individual. To some extent, although this legislation still remains very unbalanced, the amendment moved by Senator Crane will redress that imbalance to some extent. To some extent, it will redress the imbalance of a piece of legislation that has been drafted for the benefit of a mere 30 per cent of the work force in the private sector who are members of a collective&mdash;trade unions&mdash;as against the 70 per cent who prefer to retain their individuality and not belong to a trade union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, I support the amendment and particularly welcome the government's willingness to accept it. It is good to see some sense and some measure of bipartisanship on this issue.

I cannot recall one occasion when I would have felt impelled to dispense with the services of an employee on any of these grounds unless there were other reasons to do so. I may have dispensed with the services of an aged tradesperson, but I would have done so for other reasons. I recall one tradesman of 58 years who was better than many of 25. Certainly, I would not have dreamt of considering whether or not I should employ a person depending on his or her sexual preference. I did not know; it was of no interest. I welcome this opportunity to move this amendment and look forward to the government's support of it. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment deals with leave to care for immediate family. This amendment requires the commission to hold hearings and to make recommendations to the government on the provision of minimum entitlements to carer's leave. It is designed to provide Australian workers with leave of absence to look after members of their immediate families in times of illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that Australian workers with family responsibilities are properly catered for in the conditions of their employment. It has been made especially necessary by the growth of the number of women in the workplace. It is no longer the case that most women stay at home. Through choice or through economic necessity, women work in paid work as well as in unpaid work. This has led to the entirely unsatisfactory situation where women and men often have to pretend that they are ill in order to look after a child or an aged parent who is dependent on their care and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, and in the view of many Australians, it is time to stop pretending, to address this need and to recognise that there must be provision for employees to take leave to care for members of their immediate families. It is not just in the interests of workers, it is also in the interests of employers that their staff are not faced with that unmanageable conflict between their private and their working lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this amendment does not attempt to proscribe the forms of leave that should be granted by way of minimum entitlements. It leaves that difficult and complex task to a better qualified body&mdash;namely, the Industrial Relations Commission. Under the terms of this amendment, unless a test case is lodged with the commission by 1 March next year, the commission will be required to hold hearings and to make recommendations for legislation to the government. The government has undertaken to legislate the commission's recommendations for minimum entitlements to carer's leave, whether they are made in the context of a test case or whether they are through the operation of this new division that we are hoping to insert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats envisage two forms of carer's leave. The first is a form of short-term leave similar to sick leave where a child or an aged parent contracts a virus or another complaint which requires the worker to stay at home and look after them. The second is a form of long-term leave, extending possibly to several months, to care for a family member who has a much more serious and chronic ailment. A previously independent parent may suffer a stroke unexpectedly and institutionalised care may not be readily available. We all know of the deterioration in community infrastructure that has happened in Australia in recent years. Other examples are that a spouse may be dying from a terminal disease or a child may be seriously incapacitated by an accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal basis of this amendment is ILO convention 156&mdash;the family responsibilities convention&mdash;and the associated ILO recommendation 165. The recommendation spells out what is clearly envisaged by the convention&mdash;namely, that leave of absence to care for a member of workers' immediate families should be available. ILO convention 156 leaves the definition of the worker's immediate families to the countries which are party to that convention. The Democrats strongly believe that to confine that definition within narrow legal and biological boundaries would be unfair to many workers. For example, it is not unheard of for two sisters or two friends to live in a platonic relationship for many years. If one falls seriously ill, the other should not be prevented from providing care because they are not legally married. Similarly, one partner of a gay or lesbian couple should not be prevented from caring for the other in such circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot of debate in here and in the wider community these days about what is a family. I thought I would quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Families in the 1990s: a challenge for future policy approaches</EMPHASIS> from the Australian Institute of Family Studies, published in February this year. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family is not so much a matter of form, or type, or who is in it, as it is a matter of sharing, caring, emotional closeness, mutual support, creating and passing on values and traditions to the next generations.</PARA>
<PARA>We would have preferred that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill included a definition of the worker's immediate family which reflects the many and diverse forms of families which exist in Australia today. To do otherwise would unreasonably exclude far too many Australians from the entitlements envisaged in our amendment. It would be unfair and impractical not to face that reality. The government has raised the question of the constitutional soundness of our proposed definition of a worker's immediate family. We have some of our own legal advice, which Senator Spindler will raise in a moment. But we are prepared to allow the commission to take submissions on that point and to make its own judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the changing composition of the family in Australia, we will find&mdash;and my source is the Australian Bureau of Statistics&mdash;that the total number of household families in Australia is 4,775,200. The percentage of all couples is 26 per cent. Defacto couples with dependants as a percentage of all couples is 10 per cent. Step and blended families as a percentage of couple families with children is eight per cent. Lone parent families as a percentage of all families is 13 per cent. Working married couples with dependent children comprise 53 per cent of two-parent families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, as a parliament, ought to be very interested in the future of families in all their forms. We ought to be very interested in the way in which we, as a parliament, have failed to legislate for appropriate change&mdash;change which keeps up with the pace at which family life and family needs have escalated in the last decade because of the participation of women in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute for Family Studies is keeping a very close watching brief on this issue. I think it is instructive to look at some of its conclusions. For example, a review of absenteeism research conducted by Don Edgar in 1987 concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . close to 50% of all days absent were likely to be caused by family-related problems. Studies of employers in large and small businesses acknowledge that family concerns affect workers' productivity.</PARA>
<PARA>That was research by Wolcott in 1991 and 1993. Research by Adie and Carmody in the Australian Institute for Family Studies book indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasingly, Australian employers are implementing alternative working arrangements such as job sharing and `telecommuting', providing family leave and days to care for sick dependents and child care options.</PARA>
<PARA>Quoting again from the Australian Institute for Family Studies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if employers took more notice of the fact that 42% of male employees are fathers and that most men have (or will have) ageing parents to look after, perhaps a better balance between work and family would be seen as a male issue as well as a `women's' one, as a matter of best practice in employee relations.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important issue. I am pleased that the government is willing to at least address it in this way. I believe that this amendment is a major step towards enlightened management of the Australian work force. I believe that it will enhance enterprise relations.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was about to elaborate on that. The reason is that the whole supposed purpose&mdash;as I have said on several occasions during this debate, I believe it is a charade&mdash;of this legislation is to get a more flexible industrial relations structure into place. Yet here Senator Kernot wants to write into legislation specific prescriptions with regard to leave entitlements to care for family members for sickness or other reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well accept that there are circumstances where employees ought to be treated favourably by their employers and given leave to care for members of their family, but that is a matter that ought to be part of an enterprise agreement. It ought to be a matter that is capable of negotiation at the individual enterprise level, depending on the particular nature and structure of that enterprise. What might be quite appropriate in making family care leave available in one enterprise could well be entirely inappropriate in another enterprise. It is a matter that simply ought to be left to the individual enterprise, the individual employer, and to the employees to work out themselves in regard to their own circumstances. That is the first point that needs to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why this amendment ought not be passed concerns the definition of `family' that is involved. I believe that it is an absolute travesty to include lesbian or homosexual relationships within the definition of `family', as this amendment seeks to do. That is an abuse of the term `family' which is simply not acceptable to me or to my coalition colleagues. To downgrade the definition and the structure of family to that degree is simply for the term not to have any meaning at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to give support to families then it ought to be to the normal traditional family structure, which certainly needs nurturing in the sort of climate that we are experiencing in Australia today where the circumstances of families have been downgraded, where the lack of support for traditional families is quite evident and where traditional families certainly find it hard enough to continue their satisfactory existence, particularly single income families&mdash;</PARA>

As I said, single income families are finding it difficult enough to survive and to care for their family members as it is with the economic plight in which this country finds itself, largely as a result of the policies of the government that is presently in office. As Senator Parer interjected, we did not hear one word from Senator Kernot about single income families and the plight in which they find themselves. Of course, it is single income families which are attempting to maximise the care they give to their family members by at least having one parent available for the full-time care of children, despite the fact that it is often economically difficult and, in terms of the standard of living they are able to enjoy, particularly difficult for single income families to be able to provide that sort of care.

An employee is in the work force to provide for his immediate family, his common law or de facto wife and children.

Regardless of whatever accusations are made against me, I have had an employee of 31 years and I have had employees of 16 or 17 years. We have not worked on things through legislation. We have worked things out and kept our association going for years and years. I never had any trouble with employees. All those things we have worked out together have not been in legislation.

What he is asking for is an open-ended commitment that the chamber keep sitting for as long as he likes tonight. We think that is intolerable. He has a responsibility to plan a program within reasonable hours. The Senate started sitting at 10.00 a.m. today and we have said that we are prepared to sit until midnight.

We will therefore seek that the chamber adjourn now and at reasonable, appropriate opportunities through the rest of the evening we will further attempt to do so. But we do not want to. We said that we would sit until midnight. We sat until midnight earlier in the week&mdash;on Tuesday. We gave up our own business time today to help the government's program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are considering is the Democrat amendment which would require the commission to make a recommendation in respect of carer's leave. I make the point that during the division Senator Bell pointed out to me that the intent of the Democrats amendment was to fit in with the ILO convention and that it did not prescribe paid minimum entitlements, long term or short term. That may well be so in the case of the ILO convention, but what would come out of the commission may well be something different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this legislation, as I understand it, was to make enterprise agreements available throughout Australia. Initially, the minister said that it was not just for the union work force but for the non-unionised sector. I will not go into detail on this matter, but it seems to me that the main aim was a pay-off to the trade union movement. What it was meant to do, via enterprise agreements, was to rope in the non-unionised sector of the work force, particularly the 70 per cent in the private sector who were non-unionised and did not want to be unionised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me about this amendment is that it is yet another nail in the coffin of enterprise agreements. When one looks at the legislation as a whole, one can consider, for example, things like the prescriptive requirements on redundancy. No one denies that when people are put off work, every effort should be made to cushion that. I have yet to see in my working lifetime an employer who enjoys putting people off. It is a devastating experience. It causes an incredible amount of stress and it is only done, in the main, 99 per cent of the time, because of economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to actually putting people off, there is a minefield to go through. Each of these requirements is something that should be considered by a reasonable employer. When we then add to this the possibility that, incorporated in an enterprise agreement as recommended by the commission will be an additional prescriptive item, whether it be paid or unpaid, of sick leave, short term or long term, it will guarantee that there will be very few genuine enterprise agreements. At a time when there are about 1.6 million unemployed people in this country, what we must have is an encouragement to employers to invest and create full-time employment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a brief contribution on the constitutional question. Like Senator Kernot, I am rather regretful that the government saw fit to do this in this particular way&mdash;on a step by step basis rather than by biting the bullet, as it were, and legislating under the powers that I believe are available to it. We have dealt before with ILO conventions 111 and 156. There is respectable legal opinion that the combination of those two conventions would be sufficient to enact such provisions for carers leave. However, it has been put to us by Mr Anthony Morris QC that it would be possible, in his view, that section 51 (xxxv) of the constitution&mdash;the arbitration power&mdash;could be used if a particular structure were employed. I want to briefly put that on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view is that it could be brought under that section of the constitution if a number of steps were taken. The first is by amending section 3 of the act to include as one of the objects of it the provision of minimum benefits to workers with family responsibilities so that any such worker may obtain leave of absence in the case of illness of another member of the worker's immediate family who needs the worker's care or support. The phrase `who needs the worker's care or support' answers some of the questions that were raised before about the content of this provision. This should be the criterion. It should not be whether a particular person fits a strict formula of `a family' but whether a particular person living in the unit of that prospective carer needs that care and support. Surely that is the substantive beneficial definition of a family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second step would be the insertion of a definition of worker's immediate family. Such a definition was suggested by the Australian Democrats to include any person with a high level of dependence on or interdependence with the employee and who is, or may in the event of illness become, primarily dependent on the employee for care and support. The final step is the insertion in part VI, division 1 of the bill of a provision requiring that in the performance of its functions the commission shall, notwithstanding any other provision of the bill, take into account and have regard to the desirability of providing minimum benefits to workers with family responsibilities so that any such worker may obtain leave of absence in the case of the illness of another member of the worker's immediate family who needs that worker's care or support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested by Mr Anthony Morris QC that amendments along the lines proposed above would probably be upheld by the High Court of Australia as being constitutionally valid. I would like the minister's assurance that, if the test case or the ruling of the commission indicates that such a provision as is envisaged is constitutional, the government will proceed to legislate for it. </PARA>

I find it absolutely remarkable, when we are looking at reforming the situation and trying to create an atmosphere where we can actually focus on unemployment, that we are putting more and more in the way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as an experienced employer, I can tell honourable senators that there is a cost. When an employee goes on four weeks leave he arranges with his employer to take his holidays at a convenient time so that that employee will not have to be replaced. But when an employee is on extended leave for 12 months or so, he has to be replaced. As Senator Kernot said, in Belgium that person has to be replaced from the pool of unemployed persons. The position would be the same in Australia because nobody would leave one job to go to another that would last for only 12 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a cost. Whether it is Belgium or Australia, unless the employer is very lucky, the replacement will have far less experience in the job.

If the employer believes he will have that employee for a long time, he will put a lot more time into training. Perhaps he may need another employee down the track.

But I am telling her, from the examples that I have given, that it can be quite a big cost. So because of that, she has to include that as an extra burden on employers. She has to account for that cost, unless an employer is mighty lucky and an experienced person walks in, is put on that machine and does exactly the same job. A past employee might come back again. If an employer is reasonable, he will get those who come back again after trying somewhere else. An employer might be lucky, but he will not be lucky every time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will come to that. The commission will have to determine what is meant by `immediate'. In some award provisions, compassionate leave, for example, does extend to a funeral for a mother-in-law. What I am saying is that the commission will need to have regard to what the legislature means by the word `family'. The legislature has made it perfectly clear what it means by `family' and will do so again next week in respect of the child-care rebate. So I really do not think&mdash;and I might be wrong&mdash;that this debate is worth all of the time that has been spent on it so far. Again, I might be wrong, but I thought I would just offer that opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that. So if his arguments run true, why should we support this amendment that is moved by the Australian Democrats? I enter this debate in sorrow rather than anger because I do believe&mdash;I may be overemphasising this&mdash;sometimes the Democrats try to help. But, because they are inexperienced, I think most times they hinder rather than help. They remind me of ideological people that mean well, but they run through the legislation and cause absolute chaos because they are not practical people; they are idealists. If we lived in a perfect world, if everyone loved each other and if we all lived by the Bible&mdash;as no doubt Senator Woodley would tell us&mdash;then I think they would have some place in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

The people know what our various parties stand for. They elect us to make decisions. They do not elect an industrial commission to define a family. Members of industrial commissions are not elected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also concerned about this amendment. I have been following the debate very closely on the in-house monitor. My colleagues have put the arguments very well and I really cannot add a great deal to the debate, except I feel that I ought to make an observation about the stupidity of these sorts of amendments which have been put up by the Australian Democrats. I would be surprised if the Democrats' colleagues in the right wing of the Labor Party did not support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very evident that the Democrats have no feel and no understanding of what business is all about. It was stated that Senator Spindler was involved in some sort of business. If he were, I am surprised at his attitude to business. The rest of the Democrats have had no experience, and it comes through. There is nothing wrong with being teachers. Perhaps Senator Faulkner was a teacher too. Teaching is a noble profession, but it is fairly clear that these people have never had to worry at the end of the week whether they have done enough business that week to pay the wages. Business people worry all the time about whether they will be able to stay in business, whether they will be able to pay the wages or whether they will be able to keep it going. Each day they struggle through a ream of bureaucratic form filling-in or of new taxes being imposed practically monthly by governments such as this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can understand from the government's legislation that people such as Senator McMullan have never employed anyone&mdash;they always get their cheque at the end of the week. Senator Kernot always got a cheque at the end of the week. It did not matter how hard she worked or did not work, it did not matter whether she was sick or whether she had a few days off&mdash;the cheque was always there. When people do not have to worry about that they bring forward stupid legislation such as this, which just puts further imposts on business and makes it more and more difficult for people to get their businesses going, to expand their businesses, to employ people and to create wealth and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that the only way to get the country to expand is by getting small business to have the confidence to put its money into it, to expand its business and create new jobs. That is the only way the country will get going. The more we have clauses such as this from people who have absolutely no idea of what it is all about, the more difficult it becomes for small business to continue to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Spindler was in business, I am disappointed that he cannot convince his colleagues that these sorts of proposals do nothing at all to help small business. They are just more taxes and greater imposts&mdash;they do the exact opposite. I am very concerned that the Democrats have put up these amendments. They have no idea what it is like to run their own businesses and they have no idea what it is like to have to worry at the end of each week where the money is coming from. I hope the chamber by majority will reject this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment amends section 122 of the principal act which gives the commission the power to grant preference to trade unionists by prescribing preferences in all situations except those in which unionists are members of a union which has been granted exclusive coverage under 118A.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government, and the Democrats, too, in this Industrial Relations Reform Bill heavily base their legislation on the ILO conventions signed by Australia. I have to say that the conventions they have used are selective and it would be more convincing if they applied them consistently rather than in accordance with their own interests, which are incredibly transparent. Preference clauses&mdash;and this is what this issue is all about&mdash;which buttress compulsory unionism are in conflict with the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is totally opposed to the use of conventions to determine legislation in this country. I point out that if the government wants to use conventions, it should use them consistently. I refer the government to the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights, which states that everyone has the right of peaceful assembly and association. We do not disagree with that; we support that concept. The next sentence states that no-one may be compelled to belong to an association. If this government were genuine in referring to conventions it would also have referred to that particular convention and therefore it would not have brought in this clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw to the committee's attention that the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, claimed in the House of Representatives that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 122 is not, as the opposition would have people believe, a charter for either closed shops or compulsory unionism.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that power has been used very sparingly by the commission. It is not an everyday practice&mdash;far from it.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister's assertions were clearly wrong. I will assume it was due to ignorance; I do not know whether it was or not. A recent study of the journal of industrial relations showed that closed shop arrangements covered 57 per cent of all employees in unionised workplaces. So much for the fact that the power has been used sparingly by the commission! According to the same study, preference clauses were the cause of the closed shop arrangements in 11 per cent of the workplaces. The two other major causes were formal agreements between management and unions and custom and practice. It is likely that these last two causes were buttressed themselves by preference clauses. I draw that to the committee's attention because the statement made by the minister in the House of Representatives was quite clearly wrong. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The clear effect of section 122 of the existing act is to give preference to members of organisations&mdash;that is, to members of trade unions. Again, it is an example of how the legislation as it currently stands serves the interests of the minority against those of the majority. As we know only too well, less than 30 per cent of employees in the private sector now belong to trade unions; 70 per cent choose not to belong to trade unions. But those 30 per cent are to be given preference under this legislation. Quite simply, that is a position that the opposition believes is quite untenable and that is why, on behalf of the opposition, Senator Crane has moved this amendment to reverse that preference and prevent the commission having the power to grant preference to unionists; certainly, to ensure that preference cannot be awarded on the grounds of non-union membership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only circumstance where preference will be capable of being granted is where preference is granted to members of one union over another under an award, but not between members and non-members of trade unions. Again, that is a further move by which we seek to give a genuine freeing up of the industrial relations system. As I have said in earlier debates tonight, that is supposedly the intent of this legislation. We do not believe it is the intent, but that is the argument the government has put forward&mdash;that the intent of this legislation is to move towards greater flexibility in industrial relations, to allow for enterprise flexibility agreements and generally to free up the system. One cannot free up the system while one has this preference for unionists remaining as part of the legislation and that is why this amendment ought to be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I notice the minister, in his response, said that the statistics I quoted supported the view expressed by Mr Brereton. Let me repeat what Mr Brereton said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to quote one example of a union jumping the gun before this legislation is even through the parliament. I have a letter from a group called Signet, at Wakerley in Queensland, which has drawn to my attention its concerns about the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recently received two letters regarding enterprise bargaining. The first is a threatening letter from the National Union of Workers.</PARA>
<PARA>It has included a copy of that letter from the Queensland branch of the National Union of Workers. That letter was sent to the manager of Signet Identification Systems. It is a group that I do not know and I do not know what size it is. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Union request that you respond to its claim for an Enterprise Agreement dated 5 November, 1993 within 7 days of the date of this letter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A refusal by your company to enter into meaningful negotiations within that period will not be viewed favourably by the Union and its members in your employ.</PARA>
<PARA>The implication is that there are a few union members in its employ. The union wants to jump the gun on the legislation, rope in the rest of the employees and have an enterprise agreement that may or may not be acceptable to the employees of that particular company. This clearly is the sort of thing that we can expect. It is a concern that I have. I have made my point very clearly in my speech during the second reading debate that neither I nor people on this side of the chamber would be opposed to voluntary unionism&mdash;people deciding voluntarily to become members of a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do object to is coercion and intimidation because that, in itself, would signify that this is not a free country. People should have the right to join, not join or resign from any organisation they like&mdash;even a political party. I know it is difficult for honourable senators on the other side of the chamber to accept this, but that should be the freedom available to most people. I draw that to the committee's attention because it is the sort of thing that is happening even before the legislation is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another point that I would like the minister to respond to. It seemed to me that Minister Brereton was wrong in what he said about section 122 being used sparingly and that it was not an everyday practice. Yet the study by the journal of industrial relations showed that closed shop arrangements covered 57 per cent of all employees in unionised workplaces. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The letter to which my colleague Senator Parer just referred is similar to a letter that I have received dealing with the same issue. Apart from the points that Senator Parer has made in relation to this letter, what it really points out is the nonsense that we are going through as far as this government's administration of industrial relations is concerned. As I said a few moments ago, the government says that it is about achieving enterprise agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements. Surely the central requirement of an enterprise agreement is that it is an agreement entered into by the employer and the employees of a particular enterprise and, indeed, ought to be initiated by the employer or the employees of that enterprise&mdash;otherwise, it has no meaning as an enterprise agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a letter from the Queensland branch of the National Union of Workers demanding that this particular firm, Signet, respond to its claim for an enterprise agreement dated 5 November 1993 within seven days of the date of this letter. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A refusal by your company to enter into meaningful negotiations within that period will not be viewed favourably by the Union and its members in your employ.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In view of the lack of response from the minister on this, I think there are a couple of points that I would like to bring out in this particular debate. I was expecting, because of the importance of this issue, a more comprehensive response. This amendment before the committee will greatly assist the facility to free up the labour market. It will remove one of the greatest fears that many employees and employers in small business have. I think it is worth putting that on the public record because it removes the commission's ability to grant preference at its discretion. It confines preferences to members of unions who have been given 118A coverage. It removes the commission's power to grant a preference on a union, non-union basis. I think that point is worth underlining and emphasising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It confines preference to union basis so that an award can no longer be created on a union, non-union basis. A flow-on effect of that is going to severely limit or restrict that terrible practice that has grown up in parts of Australia of what is known as double and treble ticketing. That is the case where an individual happens to be a member of a union, or maybe not even a member of a union. But before that person can get onto a site&mdash;and this particularly applies to the building industry&mdash;to carry out whatever function, there is an unwritten law on that site and a `no ticket, no start' situation where that person has to join a union. That flows through into other situations. There are many examples of double and treble ticketing. It is something which, in my view, is a total breach of the freedoms and the rights of the individual and it is applied purely and simply by coercion. This amendment, while it will not completely cut that out, will certainly restrict the ability for it to happen. </PARA>

The provisions which enable the commission to award preference are not responsible for that type of activity. I did not want to enter this debate, but Senator Crane was a bit unfair to the minister when he said that the minister had not really responded to him. I think I heard him say something to the effect that this issue had been debated for the last 10 years. In fact, it has been debated a bit longer than that&mdash;culminating, I think, in the establishment of the Senate Standing Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation. I happen to have a copy of its report in my hand, but I do not know whether it is the only copy extant. That committee was established by this chamber in early 1982.

On the issue of double and treble ticketing, I cannot agree, with all due respect to Senator Harradine, with the proposition he put to us because the effect of granting preference over a non-union work site will lead in time to that site becoming unionised.

<PARA>that the employees enjoy under an award, including a state award, or any other law that the commission considers relevant. If the commission decides that such a reduction would occur, it must then determine whether a reduction would be contrary to the public interest. The public interest test is supposed to ensure that a company would make an agreement that would reduce the wages of a group of employees in return for, say, a share of the company's increased profits at a later date. I think we saw an example of that at SPC in Victoria where a similar sort of agreement was entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most companies today employ their executive managerial staff under individual contracts rather than awards, as people would know, in what I described before as the post-industrial era. In fact, the latest ABS statistics show that 33.7 per cent of managerial and executive employees are covered by awards. Companies wishing to rationalise their industrial arrangements by placing all their employees under a single certified agreement would have to go to the trouble of applying for an interim award for their senior staff before the agreement could be certified by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition amendment adjusts the threshold in paragraph 170MC(1)(a) downwards so that the commission can certify an agreement if the majority of the employees concerned are covered by awards. That would allow companies with non-award managerial and executive employees to go to a certified agreement without first seeking an interim award. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that this was raised in a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training by a company in my own state of which Senator Kernot would be aware, the Metway Bank. It is in a unique situation in that it has an enterprise agreement which has been very successful but it has 577 senior staff who are not covered by an award. As a result, the bank would have to go to the time and expense of obtaining an interim award for such staff before it could obtain a certified agreement. There are many other people in that sort of category, more so in the white collar area. It is for that reason that the opposition is proposing this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 31 demonstrates very clearly why this legislation is inadequate. The claimed purpose of this legislation is to promote enterprise agreements. This is in fact the key clause as far as enterprise agreements are concerned; yet it prescribes and circumscribes the situation regarding enterprise agreements so severely that they simply will not happen. This really demonstrates that this legislation is the very antithesis of what is required for enterprise agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of enterprise agreements is, firstly, that the employer and the employees will give thoughtful consideration as to what is in their peculiar and mutual best interests, which will always involve the maximisation of the quality of products; and, secondly, that the employer and the employees are free from any set of rules imposed upon them, as would be the case with an award, and may agree on terms and conditions of employment unique to their own circumstances. Yet this clause refers to the requirement for awards to be in place before one can have an enterprise agreement and, of course, we debated earlier the minimum standards and so on that are all part of this legislation. This clause is entirely inadequate to bring about the claims which are made for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation in no way reflects the requirements for genuine enterprise agreements. As I said, the requirement is that there be an award in place, that there be trade union involvement in the development of the enterprise agreement, that there be Industrial Relations Commission involvement in the development of an enterprise agreement, that there be a no disadvantage test applied to the development of an enterprise agreement. It even envisages the use of industrial action&mdash;strike action&mdash;rather than logical personal negotiations between the employer and the employees for the development of an enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were debating this clause in the committee stage we heard time and again that all of this simply makes the achievement of enterprise agreements far too hard and they simply will not happen. If enterprise agreements are not achieved we will not get the productivity improvement that is desperately required among businesses in Australia to restore the economic well-being of our country. Businesses will not be able to prosper and therefore will not be able to create more jobs to deal with the one million or more unemployed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of union involvement in enterprise agreements where it is not wanted by the employees, let alone the employer, is directly contrary to the concept of genuine enterprise agreements. What we need to remember is that unions remain wedded to the concept of comparative wage justice. Comparative wage justice is the very antithesis of genuine enterprise agreements. This system ought to be arranging wages and conditions of employment according to the nature and success of an individual enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation enterprise agreements will be so controlled that it is inevitable that comparative wage justice will remain prominent as part of those agreements. The result of that will be a wages scramble, which we have seen so often in the past, and inflationary consequences which will result in jobs being destroyed instead of being created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context it is worth noting that many of the certified agreements that have recently gone before the Industrial Relations Commission at federal and state level have involved agreements for wage increases based on changed work practices which will supposedly increase productivity. Those opposite may say, `That is fair enough. These agreements are about getting increased productivity and trading off the improved productivity to the employees in the form of wage increases.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it turns out that in many instances these changed work practices that have been promised by trade unions in return for wage increases are identical with the changed work practices that were promised some years ago under the second tier wage increases that were obtained in the 1980s under the accord. That is one of the last bright ideas this government had with regard to industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the productivity increases that were supposed to be obtained in return for the second tier increases given in the late 1980s were never delivered. Now we find the unions have the hide to go back to the Industrial Relations Commission and attempt to get a certified agreement to seek further wage increases on the basis of delivering the productivity increases that were supposed to have been delivered several years ago. It is no wonder this country is in the sort of economic mess that it is in when that is the approach of the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look only at the proceedings of this year's ACTU congress to see the deep seated hostility on the part of union officials towards genuine enterprise agreements and real enterprise bargaining. Its attachment to the arbitration system is firmly entrenched. That is hardly surprising because it is the centralised system and the arbitration system in Australia which gives much of the power which trade unions enjoy. That is no doubt one of the reasons why this legislation circumscribes the way in which enterprise bargaining will be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ought to note the recent review of national wage principles conducted by the Industrial Relations Commission. Grant Bellchamber, representing the ACTU, said that the restructured award system&mdash;he is referring to the restructured award system which will occur under this legislation, under this supposed move to enterprise agreements&mdash;will be capable of accommodating a more highly structured centralised system at some future time. In other words, the trade union movement is looking at returning to a more centralised system at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a real tragedy that this clause fails to implement the changes that are required in the conduct of industrial relations in Australia. That change is desperately required if we are going to generate the jobs to overcome unemployment. Of course, the government clearly recognises that this legislation will do nothing to provide more jobs and help solve the unemployment situation, because we find it is now looking at a so-called jobs levy, which is an income tax increase by another name. </PARA>

She pointed out that from May 1990 to May 1992 employment in companies with more than 100 employees fell by 15 per cent. For companies employing between 20 and 99 employees, employment fell by nearly nine per cent over those two years. But for companies with fewer than 20 employees&mdash;the quintessential small business&mdash;there was a growth in jobs of three per cent over that same two-year period. In fact, almost four out of every 10 workers are employed by businesses with fewer than 20 employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed jobs levy, like this legislation and this clause in particular, will be yet another impost on small businesses which will prevent them from having the capacity to generate more employment. If, as suggested, this levy applies at a rate between one and five per cent on incomes, it will certainly have a very detrimental effect on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall Senator Macdonald saying earlier that the Democrats&mdash;and it would seem the government&mdash;have very little understanding of how small business operates and the practical requirements of small businesses. Most of the profits of small businesses are withdrawn by the proprietors to cover their living expenses. If they have anything left over, that goes back into redevelopment; it is reinvested&mdash;as Senator O'Chee says&mdash;in the business so the business can grow, so it can be more productive and so it can employ more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have another tax in the form of a jobs levy levied on the profits of small businessmen, the money will simply not be available to put back into the business to provide more jobs. We will simply not get the job increases that small business would otherwise be capable of producing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need is not what is provided in clause 31 which, as I said, is a very tight circumscribing of the way in which enterprise agreements can be developed. In fact, we need a much more open and freer system so that we have an industrial relations system based on the needs of this country in the 21st century, not on the experiences and the history of the 19th century, on which this legislation seems to be based. Therefore, this clause ought to be opposed. To the extent that it can be improved, the opposition's amendments ought to be supported. </PARA>

Yet what we have tonight is an opportunity, in this amendment moved by the coalition, to truly support the concept of pluralism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By inserting the words `majority of' before the word `employees', we can create a pluralistic workplace. It is quite interesting.

Let us support pluralism in the workplace by supporting this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment creates the possibility for the commission to ratify an agreement provided that the majority of employees are covered by an award. What the clause as it stands would require is that every single one of them has to be covered by an award. In other words, there is no pluralism; there is no co-existence. It all has to be tightly controlled. Yet here we are supposedly reforming the industrial relations system. </PARA>

Senator Foreman has been in this chamber long enough to know that, and I do not think he ought to be advocating that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we on this side of the chamber do not want is to proceed down the path that those on the other side have given us. They say, `Everything has to be controlled by the award. Unless it is controlled by the award&mdash;heavens!&mdash;we can't trust people because they might make a decision that's in their own interests and that we do not agree with'. This is what it is all about; it is about control. It is about control of workers&mdash;because unions do not trust workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as unions are concerned, the terrible thing about workers is that they do not always agree with the union. And then heaven help us. What is going to happen? If they do not all agree with the union, maybe you cannot pull them out, brothers. Maybe you cannot force them all to come out on strike. We are advocating a pluralistic system, a system that has a little bit of flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know a little bit of flexibility is too much flexibility for some of the people on the other side of the chamber. I will give those opposite a compliment: they have all got backbone. The only problem is that they do not have those little bits that go in between the vertebrae. So they are thoroughly rigid from top to bottom&mdash;lots of backbone, but no flexibility. That is the problem of those on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are advocating a more flexible system of employees and employers working together. More importantly, we are advocating a system under which we do not have to have each and every member of the business covered by an award.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe we might even increase union membership. The funny thing about unions is that when people are compelled to join them, they do not want to join.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister, in his response to me, said that the government was opposed to this amendment because it would have allowed non-award people to have a certified agreement.

I would have thought that one important aspect of any piece of legislation that comes into this place is that it introduce an element of efficiency which represents cost savings, which makes our businesses more competitive and which, in the long run, is in the interests of the employees, the company and, ultimately, the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now we really are getting into what one might term the guts of this bill and what it really should be called&mdash;the union enhancement bill. The government, the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine had an opportunity, which they have let pass, to have a little bit of democracy in this place tonight. The rights of the individual could have been protected in a situation where there was a majority. That came through and was expressed, but of course this government is not interested in that. It is interested in enshrining more power in the ACTU. It is interested in centralising the whole of industrial relations back into Canberra under its control, its mates and its masters. That is what is contained in this part of the bill that we are dealing with now. It amazes me that the Democrats in particular&mdash;in view of what they supposedly stood for&mdash;can be part of that process and can be bought so easily to go down this road.

From the information contained in this report I can inform you that in the 1992/93 assessment year, in agencies which made performance pay payments, an estimated 18,005 senior officers and all equivalent classifications were eligible for a performance payment. Of these, 16,476 senior officers and equivalent classifications received payments which varied depending on the available maxima for each classification. The overall average payment was $2,435 and the total paid was $43,835,727 which is the only aggregate information available to me. This information was obtained from the Finance Pay System.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)(a) Information on the bonuses paid for ratings for each agency is not collected centrally.

Under the Government's reporting guidelines for the introduction of performance pay in the Australian Public Service, Annual Reports are required to provide information on the bonuses paid to all the classifications in the senior officer and senior executive service groups where there are three or more staff eligible to receive performance pay. This information is to show the aggregate amount paid to each group and the total number of eligible individuals in each group. Where the number of officers in a group is six or more the distribution of recipients in the group is to be shown according to the percentage of maximum permissible performance pay received by individuals. There is no requirement to report ratings.</PARA>
