<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take great pleasure in introducing to the Senate the Road Transport Reform (Vehicles and Traffic) Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is part of a scheme designed to improve the safety and efficiency of road transport and to reduce the administrative costs associated with road transport operations in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seeks to achieve the objectives of the Heads of Government Agreements on Heavy and Light Vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Agreements provided for a complementary legislative model to achieve a workable framework for the implementation of a national scheme of road transport regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contradictory road regulations and charges imposed by each of the eight State and Territory Governments have seriously constrained road transport efficiency, and have impeded the flow of trade between States, to the ultimate cost of Australian consumers and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scheme is being developed by the National Road Transport Commission which was established in January 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the terms of the Agreements, the Commonwealth is required to submit to Parliament road transport legislation on behalf of the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory. The States and the Northern Territory will then secure the passage of adopting legislation through their respective Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future amendments to the Commonwealth legislation and regulations on behalf of the ACT will automatically flow on to the other States and Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Council for Road Transport endorsed a proposal at its meeting in October 1992 to divide the task of creating uniform road transport law into modules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The road transport legislation is being developed at two levels:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a set of broad principles to provide an overall legislative framework, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a series of regulations covering technical standards which will be progressively incorporated into the  legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill covers the module dealing with the operation of vehicles and traffic rules. It is designed to put into place a range of regulations covering issues such as heavy vehicle standards, driver standards, traffic and vehicle operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further bills will be developed to deal with registration, driver licensing and compliance. These bills will in time be combined to form the Road Transport Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been developed by the Commission in close consultation with all jurisdictions. A Regulatory Impact Statement was circulated widely and submissions in response to that Statement, including those from the road transport industry, were taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial Council voted in favour of the bill on 31 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first set of regulations under this bill have been drafted. The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Standards) Regulations are expected to be forwarded to Ministerial Council for formal consideration by the end of August or in early September. I envisage that these regulations will be tabled in the Senate during the latter part of the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that regulations can be made to apply as laws in the ACT and Jervis Bay. The regulations will commence on a date agreed by the Ministerial Council and specified in the Commonwealth Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum penalties in relation to offences for breaches of the regulations will be $2 000 for an individual and $10 000 for a body corporate. In the case of overloading, the penalties will be $3 000 and $15 000 respectively. The higher penalties for overloading offences reflect the more serious impact of overloading in terms of safety and road pavement damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the Minister (being the relevant Minister in each of the jurisdictions) may declare that the operation of the regulations are suspended in a specified area or even a whole jurisdiction. Such application orders will be made in accordance with the provisions of the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991 and are subject to disallowance by the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, there is provision for particular vehicles or persons within a jurisdiction to be exempt from complying with a specific regulation. Conditions for exemptions will be agreed to by Ministerial Council and included in the regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government is committed to continuing reforms aimed at increasing the efficiency of the road transport industry and improving the environment in which it operates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of uniform or consistent regulations is regarded as an integral element in achieving reforms in the road transport industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore support the efforts of the Commission to develop a truly national approach which will result in one nationally consistent and durable set of regulations covering the use of our roads and particularly the operation of heavy vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State Governments must also demonstrate their commitment to the reform process to ensure the objectives of the reform process are achieved and to enable the road transport industry to reap the benefits of these reforms as early as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in this bill have no significant impact on Government revenues or expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate and I draw honourable senators' attention to the fact that Nicholas Stone's family are present in the gallery with us today. I wanted to draw to the Senate's attention what lay behind this motion. About two and a half years ago, a nine-year-old was knocked down outside his home in a motor accident. That accident was seen by his father. There was then a mad rush by helicopter to a hospital in the city because they live in the country. In that two hours the parents had to drive through peak hour traffic to get to their son's bedside and to be told that he was brain dead. They were then asked to sign a consent form to donate his organs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us who are parents would realise that it is so terrible to lose a child and that the thought of having other pressures like this on them at that time must have been dreadful. Nevertheless, after great turmoil, they knew that, in a family conversation not long before, the nine-year-old had said that in this eventuality he believed his organs should go to somebody else. So, with terrible anguish, they gave consent, but as they look back now they realise that they were in no fit state to give that consent. Sadly, there were no counselling services available at that hospital for them in their agony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, their questions were answered by a surgeon who probably himself was uncomfortable and brusque in his treatment of them. They have now lived with that agony for two and a half years. But it does not end with a personal tragedy; it ends with hope for Australia, because those parents, Peggy and Ross Stone, have set up an organisation called the Silent Hearts Donor Family Steering Committee as a recognition of the hearts that go on beating in other bodies and the silent hearts that are in pain in the families of those people in Australia who gave those organs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This family is looking for recognition for the families who go through those terrible decisions. They look for support for all families so that they do not go through this anguish alone. They also look to give support services&mdash;mutual support to other parents in the same position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Senate for supporting this motion. This is an extremely important matter that should be drawn to the attention of the federal parliament. In that we are facing the International Year of the Family in the coming year, I would hope that the federal government would see that counselling services for grieving parents, for any purpose but particularly in this area of organ transplants, could be ensured for all those going through these difficult decisions. </PARA>

<PARA>I rise to speak regarding the procedural motion which I have just moved. First, I give a brief statement as to why I foreshadowed this motion on 27 May and why I think it is of great significance for the consideration of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years the government, whether of one party or the other, has been in a position of having a logjam of bills within the House of Representatives which then come through to the Senate without proper notice and the chance for proper debate. I have some statistics, which I will provide to the Senate, about the way in which those bills have been processed through the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives does not have the chance to give consideration to the bills that come through to it; and time pressures in that house make it almost impossible for us in this place to have the chance to consider such legislation before it arrives in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, a deadline was imposed by the Senate to try to prevent the logjam of bills, but it failed because of the rush that occurs. The double deadline motion that I am presenting today is intended to streamline routine legislation and allow sufficient time for public scrutiny and proper consideration. It will not prevent the exemption of financial and urgent bills which can be presented by leave or notice of motion within a half a day or one day. Bills which do not make the deadline or exemption can be referred to committees, with debate adjourned until the first sitting day of the next session. Basically that is a statement of the motion before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All senators have been present in the chamber&mdash;some for many years longer than I&mdash;when we have been forced to sit to late hours to push through legislation that has not received our proper consideration. We have had no notice of its coming through; we have had no opportunity to consider it; and on occasions when the guillotine has been applied we have not even had a chance to listen to debate on it, particularly in the last weeks of the session. The comments that have been made on this situation both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate are well known and I will not repeat them. However, I seek leave to table some statistics on the way in which these bills have entered the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are tables of the introduction of bills and the bills that have been passed and the graphs relating to them. These figures illustrate the intent of the motion that we have before us. If I can refer honourable senators to the graph of bills introduced from the time of the autumn 1989 sitting to the present time, they will notice that the percentage of bills that have been introduced in the first, second and third thirds of the sitting are noted there. The motion before us today takes that into account in setting the dates of its operation. My motion begins:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That where a bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)is first introduced in the House of Representatives after 1 October 1993; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That date of 1 October takes into account that there are seven weeks between yesterday, the budget day, and the deadline of 1 October and there are 13 sitting days. The second section of my motion specifies the situation where a bill:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)is received by the Senate from the House of Representatives after 29 October 1993; . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That date marks another third of the sittings, which is 10 sitting days. The final third of the sittings, the period after 29 October, has 14 sitting days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale behind my motion is this: the 1 October deadline for introduction in the House of representatives is not a deadline to the House; it is simply an indication that if a bill is introduced before that time it will be dealt with in the Senate in a particular way but that if it is introduced after that time it will be dealt with in a different way. Therefore it is not an instruction to the House of Representatives; it is simply an indication that, if senators have advance notice of legislation because it has been introduced in the other place, the Senate is free to debate it and pass it in the remaining two-thirds of the sittings. If the Senate does not have notice of it at that time, it can be referred to a committee for consideration, but otherwise it will be deferred to the first day of the following sitting period for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this adjournment is to allow due consideration to be given and to allow for community consultation and scrutiny before we actually debate and pass a bill. We are not failing to pass; adjourning is not failure to pass. It simply enables the Senate to devote proper time for scrutiny and considered judgment on legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the first third simply relates to introduction, so there is no commitment to the House of Representatives to pass a bill within that first third of the sitting. It has the remainder of the sittings to pass it. It simply provides advance notice that a bill is actually under consideration in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second third, a deadline is set which is very similar to the Macklin motion in that, if we receive bills that have been passed in the other place or if they are introduced in the Senate by 29 October, they will be given consideration, debated, passed and sent back to the House. However, if a bill arrives after that time&mdash;that is, in the last third of the sittings, which represents 14 sitting days&mdash;it may be referred or adjourned for further consideration during the next session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators will be able to see if they have had time to scrutinise the statistical information in front of them, we have a heavy workload in the chamber, but it is not an even workload. I refer honourable senators to the graphs; firstly to that for the bills introduced during each third of the sittings. These are the averages; honourable senators can deduce from the individual statistics they have which were the good years and which were the bad years. The graphs represent the composite pattern: in the first third of the sittings we usually introduce 33 per cent of the legislation, in the second third 54 per cent is introduced, and in the final third 22 per cent is introduced. This does not take into consideration the fact that the Macklin motion has sometimes operated in the last four, three or two weeks and sometimes has not operated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second graph illustrates the percentage of bills that have been passed during each third of the sittings. The pattern is: 16 per cent in the first third, 28 per cent in the second third, and 55 per cent in the last third of the sitting. The obvious problem is that a great burden of legislation accumulates towards the middle and end of the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of my motion is summarised in the third graph, where the first two graphs are superimposed on each other. They do not bear a relationship to each other, I might add, because bills that are introduced and bills that are passed may be different. But they do represent the amount of legislation being considered within the chamber at that point in time. What we have is a relatively light load in the first third, a large load in the second third and a large load in the last third. If we removed the introduction of bills from the third section of the sittings&mdash;which is in black&mdash;and put it into the first section, it would graphically represent the purpose of my motion, which is simply to ensure that the introduction of bills comes at the beginning of the sittings and that the consideration and passage of the bills come at the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extremely logical motion. It may sound complicated. Some people have given it adverse publicity, and there has been a lot of inaccuracy about it. I am very grateful to certain newspapers for being able to see the logic in the motion. I will discuss the press comments later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I precede that by expressing my disappointment at the way the government has reacted, and the way the motion has been taken by the Leader of the House in the House of Representatives, Mr Beazley. He made some statements which I consider personally offensive, not just to me but also to the motivation of other people in relation to what I am doing. In particular, I would like to record here my extreme disappointment that the Office of the Clerk of the Senate has been criticised and used in a way that I consider to be totally unparliamentary and to show a sheer disrespect for the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an arrogance behind the demands and comments that have been made that fails to recognise that there are two processes of accountability available to the people of Australia. The first process is through elections, and the mandate that is given to the government in the House of Representatives to the government. There is nothing within my procedural motion that should challenge the mandate that the government received at the election in any way, shape or form. However, in between elections there is an accountability factor for any elected government: to give consideration to the due process of parliament. That is the second aspect of true democracy and it is the Senate that holds that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our election is a different one, our task is a different one. We have a mandate that deserves as much respect as the mandate which the House of Representatives claims so loudly and fiercely. Our mandate does not interfere with or obstruct the government; it keeps the government, in its legislation, accountable to the will of the people, and it involves doing our job in such a way that the Senate constitutes a house of review. The motion that I present is a way of improving the way we do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The help that I received from the Clerk of the Senate, which is quite openly stated, is help that he has given in the past to other senators who are present in the chamber. When I first approached him and mentioned my grave concerns about what was happening in the Senate chamber and asked whether there were any procedural reforms that could be undertaken, the Clerk replied that he had previously written some pages for others and that he would provide me with this information. I did not know to whom this information and suggested notice of motion had been given. I was informed by a member of the Democrats later on that the suggested wording had been prepared for them at the end of 1992 and that they had decided not to present them. I am very grateful for the assistance provided by the Clerk of the Senate. I would like to apologise for any inadvertent slur on him that has been caused through my revealing how helpful he had been in response to my request for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that the opposition's motivations have been called into question. I call on members of the opposition to defend themselves as I know I do not have to defend them. I believe that their credibility is on the line as well, because comments have been made by the government regarding the use of the two Greens in the chamber as a patsy or as part of some sort of manoeuvring. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that they did not believe it. I think that any opposition would consider this motion very carefully because it is helpful in allowing due consideration to be given to the work of this chamber. I challenge the government by asking whether, if it were in opposition, it would not want a similar motion. I encourage government members to consider their secondary responsibility when they are actually in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that editorials in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury </EMPHASIS>conveyed the true motivation behind this motion. If the same attention had been given to the procedural motion by some of the other media representatives, there would have been far less concern in the community about the very rash words stated and the furore that was created over what unfortunately looks very like bullying tactics and a lack of respect by the government for the due process of parliament within the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At this point I would like to say that I have no particular investment in the form of this motion. I put a lot of effort into devising it. I wanted it to be helpful for both the House of Representatives and the Senate, not because it imposes anything on the House of Representatives but because it lets the House of Representatives know the way in which the Senate wants to conduct its business. That will obviously have an impact, and that is not improper. But the House of Representatives is free to respond to this in whatever way it chooses. If it responds in such a way that we are able to get early notification and also the members of the House of Representatives are able to give due consideration to legislation and avoid the rush that they have always had to contend with, even when the Macklin motion operated, that will be a very beneficial outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have explained in my motion to the Senate by using graphs the form and the dates involved. I have been open to negotiation on all matters. In particular, when the government supporters expressed their distress that the government could not deal with budget legislation in time and pointed out that they did not consider that seven weeks, or 45 days, are sufficient for the estimated 30 pieces of legislation that may emanate from yesterday, I assured them that the opposition is supporting this motion, paragraph (3) of which says that bills arising from the budget statements or urgent bills can be introduced by leave or by notice of motion given the day before, right up until the last day of the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that there have always been exemptions to the deadline imposed under the Macklin motion. I expect there to be exemptions under this motion. Those exemptions will not be difficult. The government will be able to let us know what bills or package of bills will be really difficult for it to produce by the dates that we have set in the Senate. I think there is an opportunity for the good faith of the Senate to be reflected. This is the first time that such a motion has been introduced here. So, in one sense the phrasing of my motion is a trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to foreshadow that if this motion is accepted by the Senate I will reframe it in the form of a standing order. The standing order will not have fixed dates but will refer to the first third, the second third and the third third of the sittings, because of the logic that I have presented to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At some time in these sittings I will be giving a notice of motion proposing a standing order to that effect. I will do it towards the end of these sittings after we see whether this trial is effective. I believe that the Opposition's continued support will remove any excuse for the government to say that the opposition is simply obstructing its work on a hit and miss basis. The Greens will put forward this further motion which will show that the opposition has the opportunity to show a commitment to engage in considered debate during the passage of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also put forward this motion because I think it represents a challenge to government supporters. If they see this as simply a trial period, they may not give their best endeavours to accommodating it; and, if the intent of the motion is sabotaged, they may think it will not ever be introduced again. So I foreshadow that at the end of these sittings I will introduce a motion for the next sittings which, although more general, will be in substantially the same form as the motion that I have defended and presented to the Senate today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trouble with Senator Chamarette's motion is not its motivation but the way in which it responds to that motivation; the way in which it seeks to implement a particular way of doing things. The motivation itself is one of reasonable concern about Senate legislative processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two aspects of what she is saying that are absolutely reasonable concerns, and I frankly acknowledge them as such. The first is a reasonable concern to want commitments about the early access of all honourable senators to legislation and to the documentation that goes with that legislation to enable a reasonable time to prepare a response to it. That is a particularly legitimate concern so far as the smaller parties, with lesser resources available to them, are concerned. I squarely and openly acknowledge the legitimacy of that concern and I think we ought to do our best to meet it. Secondly, it is absolutely reasonable to want more even scheduling of the actual progress of business in this place&mdash;not simply the early introduction of legislation in either chamber so honourable senators have access to the detail of it, but the actual dealing with the business itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the statistics that Senator Chamarette has put in front of us today. They do tell a story that all of us who have been here for any time know all too well. They tell a story about the rush of legislative business that does inexorably seem to accumulate and create problems for us in dealing with it in the latter part of each sittings. All of us, I think, are conscious of the need to try to improve that situation. Today I am prepared to make some important new commitments in relation to that, and I will come to those later. I am prepared to indicate to the Senate the action that we are taking already to implement those commitments, and I will come back to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying, first, is that the concerns and the motivations are reasonable. I do not want to be taken in any way as undermining the good faith, in that sense, of what the Greens are on about. What, however, is not reasonable is the way in which they are seeking to translate those concerns into the practice and processes of this place. There are three basic problems with what Senator Chamarette is proposing to us. The first of them is in imposing what is, for all practical purposes, an effective cut-off date of 1 October for the introduction of a very significant class of legislation&mdash;that which, for constitutional or other reasons, has to be introduced in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say frankly that that deadline of 1 October simply cannot be met nor could it be met by any government, however reasonably minded, however many resources we sought to put into the drafting process. The task is simply too big and too complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain why. We have in our current legislative program, at the latest estimate, 84 bills in 50 packages which we have identified as essential for passage these sittings, plus the budget bills. The budget bills, on information available to me, represent the seven bills that were actually introduced into the House of Representatives last night, plus another 11 or 12 bills which remain to be drafted and introduced and which deal with the budgetary implications of last night's statement for particular departments in particular policy areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate has already been given notice of the 84 bills in the non-budget category. The Senate has already been given notice in the forward program that was circulated of, I think, 71 bills that were intended for passage and the program by which we hope to get them circulated to honourable senators. There are in addition to that, I tell the Senate now, the wool industry package which, on information presently available to me, may involve some 10 bills to be dealt with together. In addition, legislation is required for ATSIC and in relation to Qantas. That brings the figure up to 83 or 84 bills of a non-budgetary kind. We then have the other group that I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that, on the information available to me, it is simply not possible for all of those bills to be drafted by 1 October. The shortfall would be at least of the order of 20 or so bills on the present indication, and that is with maximum resources being devoted to the drafting effort. A significant number of those&mdash;I cannot be precise about it&mdash;simply have to be, for constitutional or other reasons, introduced into the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem which follows on from that is that it is simply not reasonable to claim that the processes inherent in Senator Chamarette's motion, the fail-safe aspects of them, if you were, will in fact be a satisfactory way of accommodating the reality that I have just described. Senator Chamarette is proposing that for any bill which fails to meet the cut-off deadlines she has identified there has to be a separate debate effectively in this chamber&mdash;except in the wholly highly unlikely event that there is consensus and a willingness to accept this simply by leave&mdash;as to the merits of allowing that particular legislation to proceed. So at the very least, on our current procedures, we would have a half an hour's debate looking ahead in relation to, on my present estimate, at least 20 or so bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, I do not think it can be said that the procedural problems and the potential for delay and disruption built into this would necessarily stop at that basic half-hour debate for the motion of suspension of standing orders. We have to anticipate from hard, long experience in this place a disposition on the part of the opposition and some other senators to make life as procedurally difficult as possible. That is an unfortunate, unhappy state of reality. If honourable senators approach this exercise from the perspective of wanting to make life as procedurally difficult as possible for the government, then Senator Chamarette's motion and the sessional order that would be reflected by it would be very fertile ground indeed for such a further exercise in procedural disruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give the Senate one small example, paragraph (3) of Senator Chamarette's motion&mdash;this is the fail-safe escape clause, as she describes it in effect&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This order may be suspended by motion on notice, subject to the time limits on debate on motions to suspend standing and other orders, in relation to bills arising from the budget statements or urgent bills.</PARA>
<PARA>In order for that paragraph (3) to apply, the bill has to be identified, effectively in advance, as having the character of being either an urgent bill or a budget statement. There is nothing objectively ascertainable about whether a bill is an urgent bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, a long argument about what is or is not properly described as a budget bill. We would say unquestionably that a budget bill is anything which is required by legislation flowing from what is in the budget statements&mdash;not just an appropriation bill or a loan bill or a taxing bill, but in that sense. One can obviously anticipate argument about this. Whether it is well-intentioned or reasoned argument is not the point. The fact is that there is argument, there is procedural discussion, there is scope for delay. That is the reality of this place. That is the kind of difficulty that confronts a government trying, with the best will in the world, to get on with the dispatch of properly laid down, properly anticipated government business. That is why it is simply unreasonable to be putting this kind of constraint upon any government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give just one example of the kind of procedural disruption of the sort I have just mentioned that would arise in relation, say, to the Mabo legislation which we have foreshadowed and which certainly would be extremely difficult, on present indications, to guarantee being able to be introduced into the House of Representatives by the cut-off date of 1 October. The nature of that legislation, given the role played by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in that respect, is such that one would anticipate its being introduced and debated in the first instance in the House of Representatives, and properly so. We would then have a lovely debate in this place, before we even got to the actual text of Senator Chamarette's motion, on whether this was in fact an urgent bill, whether it was urgently necessary to deal with the Mabo question in the way that we are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just one small example of the kind of problem that I know from long, unhappy past experience can be generated when these kinds of opportunities are created. Even Senator Hill could take advantage of the loopholes in this particular legislation to make life extremely complex, difficult and protracted for all of us. That is the nature of the forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third problem with Senator Chamarette's motion which makes it unreasonable, not in its motivation but in its practical implementation, is what it is saying about the relationship between the Senate and the House of Representatives. For the Senate to seek to directly determine the House of Representatives' business is simply unconscionable in principle and, I would suggest, ought not to be accepted in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to say in this place that certain consequences will follow from legislation being received in the Senate beyond some certain date: that when the Senate is first confronted with a piece of legislation, if that legislation arrives beyond a certain date&mdash;this is the sort of issue we have had in the past with the Macklin resolution, the Democrats' resolution&mdash;then certain adverse consequences will flow if it is late. It is one thing to say that; it is another thing to say that legislation generally which the Senate is going to have to deal with should be introduced somewhere into the parliamentary system by a certain time in order to meet the Greens' concerns about having advance notice of the content of that legislation and access to the documentation. Having conceded all of that, I believe it is quite another thing to effectively prescribe the processes, prescribe the precise times within which things have to be done in the other chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that part of the Greens' motion which sets the 1 October deadline for bills to be introduced in the House of Representatives does just that. That is not just some indirect way of referring to what the Senate is likely to do at some later stage when the bill is actually received. It is a direct prescription of the flow of business, purported discipline being placed upon the actual conduct of the House of Representatives. That is simply not something that the Senate, even in its most excessive days of the past, has ever thought it proper to do. I say to Senator Chamarette and to her colleague Senator Margetts to please think again about that particular aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of bills which simply have to be introduced in the House of Representatives. To say that 1 October is the point beyond which, prima facie, the Senate is not going to be prepared to deal with legislation is, in effect, to deny the capacity of the House of Representatives to function properly so far as those categories of bills are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third aspect that needs to be referred to. It is a problem which has generated such a response from the Leader of the House, Mr Beazley. One could expect consequences to flow in the House of Representatives in the way the business is ordered and the kind of attention that would have to be given to government business at the expense of other kinds of business if this motion were to pass, and if this discipline were purported to be imposed and were actually imposed on the House of Representatives by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be understandable that the Green senators should bring this motion forward in the way that they have, with its detailed content, as unreasonable as I have argued it to be. Obviously they have had no experience of executive government and have had no direct access to the labyrinthine operations of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. They cannot be expected to have any detailed grasp of the kind of complexities that are involved in these processes. They have obviously had no experience of processes in the House of Representatives&mdash;by definition, they are here for the first time in the Senate&mdash;nor have they had a great deal of experience of the Senate process itself, though they have had some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Greens can be persuaded by this debate&mdash;and in particular by what I am about to say in a moment about how we will meet some of these problems that are genuine concerns&mdash;to change their mind and not pursue the motion that they have introduced. They have said that they want to listen to the debate, they want to be reasonable and they just want to improve the way things are done. I understand that and I hope we can accommodate them. I am not wanting to be especially critical of the Greens in the ways that I have just described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the opposition is in a very different category altogether. If the opposition proceeds with its foreshadowed disposition to support the Greens in this particular respect, having had the experience it has had in government, albeit a very long time ago, having the aspirations that it presumably still has to go back into government, it is simply behaving, I have to say, with all due concern registering in my voice, in a way that is unconscionable and at odds with what it is purporting to present itself to the Australian public to be&mdash;namely, a responsible alternative government. This is of course the view that we saw last year when in the budget session, the opposition, believing that its access to government was imminent, did not for the first time for a very long time support the Democrat motion setting a particular closing date. </PARA>

It is simply inexcusable oppositionist behaviour from people who ought to know better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, let me turn constructively and positively to the concerns that underlie the Greens' motion. I have already circulated around the chamber this morning a statement which I will now formally table and take the Senate through. What we are prepared to do is address very directly the two basic issues that underlie the Greens' concerns. One is the dates on which bills are introduced and become available on the public record&mdash;the date on which we have access to the text and the supporting documentation. The second thing we are prepared to do is address the question of scheduling of the actual debates&mdash;the way in which those bills, whenever introduced, are actually dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the introduction of bills, I am prepared on behalf of the government to undertake to introduce in either the House of Representatives or the Senate at least half the bills that are proposed for passage this session by 21 October. I say immediately that our present expectation is that that target will be exceeded&mdash;hopefully, well exceeded&mdash;by that date. I have indicated the magnitude of the legislative program and the task ahead of us in this respect, requiring as it does something like 100 bills in total to be dealt with this session, of which only a very small number have so far been introduced or carried over from the previous session. That is the order of magnitude that we are talking about. I am prepared to be explicit in a few days' time, if that is helpful, about when our final program beds itself down, about numbers and the shape and content of that legislation so everyone can see what is involved and so that the 50 per cent figure will be a meaningful one. I give that undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further undertake to ensure that the remainder of the bills that are proposed for passage this session be introduced, either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate, by 18 November this year. Again, our expectation is that the great majority of the remaining bills will be introduced into either house well before that date, but we are prepared to live with that being set as a final cut-off date. The only exception we are contemplating is in relation to urgent and unforeseen legislation. By definition, we have no such legislation in contemplation at the moment. Of course, were we to seek the introduction of a presently unforeseen piece of legislation on that basis, we would seek the leave of the Senate to do so and there would obviously be an opportunity in the normal way to determine whether it would let us proceed. We accept that discipline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say further in this respect that the government will make maximum endeavours to expedite the preparation of all legislation. We will introduce it progressively just as soon as government processes are complete. We certainly see no advantage whatsoever in holding back, and will not hold back, until the dates mentioned any legislation which is available earlier. I am quite explicitly prepared to make those undertakings and commitments. I do so after full consultation with my ministerial colleagues in the other place and with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I have no reason to believe that there will be difficulty about meeting those particular commitments. Obviously they should count in any reasonable assembly as reasonable commitments and would certainly ensure that there is that early access to legislation and time for preparation that is being sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As to the second issue&mdash;the actual scheduling of legislation for debate and passage&mdash;this is a very much more difficult thing for the government to make commitments about because we do not have control of the processes of this place. It is very much up to the Senate itself, as well as to the government, as to whether or not a particular timetable for the passage of legislation is met. The best I can do here is express our best endeavours; I cannot give undertakings. I would like to but I cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do say that the government will make its best endeavours to program legislation for debate and passage in the Senate in an evenly spread way throughout the session and, in particular, to have one-third of the bills that are proposed for passage this budget session dealt with by 1 October, which is the completion date for the first third of the sitting period; to have a further one-third of such bills dealt with by 18 November, which is the termination of the second third period; and to have the last one-third dealt with in the remainder of the scheduled sitting period, that is by 16 December, which is our presently identified closing date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that I am unable to give specific undertakings about that. In relation to the first third, it may well be extremely difficult, even with the best will in the world and even with maximum cooperation&mdash;which hopefully will be forthcoming from the other side&mdash;to meet that particular objective. In this first week a lot of time, including this discussion right now, is being spent on procedural issues. We do have to await the processes in the House of Representatives for a significant proportion of the bills that we are anticipating in this first period. I am not as confident that we will meet that, but we will make best endeavours and certainly I believe that we can get up a head of steam in that second third period and leave a much more manageable situation as a result in the last period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say in this respect&mdash;I know that Senator Faulkner, as Manager of Government Business, will want to make this point further because he has been spending a lot of time on it recently&mdash;that our good faith has been demonstrated already by our circulation on 23 July, for the first time ever in this form, of a detailed outline of most of the bills scheduled for passage this session. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am telling the Senate what we are doing now. I was not Leader of the Government, amongst other things, a few years ago. Quite apart from anything else, I have certainly been unhappy with the programming of legislation in this place and the progressive deterioration, as I have perceived it over the years, in the capacity of legislation to come forward. I have been increasingly conscious of the need of the smaller parties in this place to have longer advance notice, and I am very happy to cooperate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 July, long before we got here, honourable senators received a detailed bundle of documentation describing, in summary form, the content of some 40 or so bills that were in the `essential for passage' category for these sittings. We will supplement that as soon as possible&mdash;hopefully within the next few days&mdash;with a further bundle of information about the remaining part of the legislative program that we are in a position to give information about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Harradine has concerns, which he will no doubt express, that he would like even more information than this to come forward in various ways at earlier stages. I honestly believe that we have gone a long way towards accommodating legitimate concerns in this respect and we will certainly keep that up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, honourable senators have received, as has become customary in recent years, a detailed forward program, which was circulated by the Manager of Government Business on 9 August&mdash;last week, which was well before we convened. As I said, it contained some 71 bills, and demonstrated the way in which we hope to program over that period. We will supplement it with a further revised forward program as soon as we know what precise shape the budget bills are likely to take and when they are likely to be ready for introduction. When we can make some better judgments about that, it will be progressively updated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, looking to the future and moving beyond this budget session, we are conscious of the need, if we possibly can, to do even better than this. We have decided in principle that in future we will introduce legislation&mdash;to the extent it proves possible; I have to add that qualification&mdash;on the basis of introduction in one sittings for debate in the next. I guess that that is the optimal position for everyone in this chamber. It will give everyone the opportunity in the parliamentary break to fully consider their position and take such advice as they want, research it, produce sensible responses and deal with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process will always have some exceptions built into it. Under the present budgetary process, obviously budget bills will always be an exception. However, that may not need to be the case under our proposed new system for dealing with budgets before the end of June. The precise implications of that for session times and sitting times have yet to be fully considered, so I cannot give any detailed description of what the process will be in that respect now. Obviously, it will make it potentially possible for that category of exception to be removed or modified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, there will always have to be exceptions for urgent bills on unforeseen subjects. There will also be obvious exceptions for particular bills where there is quite obviously specific reason for both introducing and passing it in the same session. An example is a foreshadowed bill that involves a long process of consultation with various groups  and is scheduled for both introduction and debate in some future session. That will always be the kind of case that we will deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, before this process is bedded down, we have to expect some reasonable passage of time. I think it would probably take two or more sittings to fully implement a system based on, so far as possible, introducing legislation one sitting and debating it the next. All I can say is that steps are now being taken to make a significant start on it in these sittings; in other words, to try to work out, right now, what the legislative program will be for the first sittings next year and a way in which a significant number of the bills for passage next sittings&mdash;the autumn sittings next year&mdash;can be at least introduced and put on the table by the time we get up in December. I am not sure how big a start it is possible to make on that, but we are trying hard to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there it is, Mr Acting Deputy President. I hope that I have responded in a way that has been constructive and has demonstrated that we do understand the concerns and problems. We are trying in practice to do a lot about it, and we are willing to convert some of that effort into formal undertakings and commitments of the kind that I have given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that on the basis of what I have said it is appreciated that we are trying to be reasonable. I have already said that I find the motivations and concerns of the Greens reasonable. What is not reasonable is the way in which they have translated that into the text of the motion that is presently before us. I hope that proves capable of appropriate amendment during this debate. If not, I hope that the Greens will reconsider whether they should go ahead with the motion in those terms, and that, rather, they will accept the kinds of commitments that I have made here now. </PARA>

The programming of this government has allowed insufficient time for the consideration of bills in the House of Representatives and the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some managers of government business that I have dealt with from this end have tried to improve the situation over the years. Senator Ray tried, as did Senator Bob McMullan.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government&mdash;probably starting with Mr Keating and including his spokesman in relation to the program at the other end&mdash;really does not see the parliamentary process as being important. For the government, the legislative process is simply the parliament giving a rubber stamp to the actions of the executive. It is not interested in setting a program that allows the parliament a reasonable time to consider and deliberate upon legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that is being proposed in this motion today is the setting up of a structure that would enable both houses of this parliament a reasonable time to consider the government's legislation. What is so terrible about that? I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that such a reform can only be for the benefit of the parliamentary process in this country and the betterment of democracy and the quality of legislation that is the outcome of this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had demonstrated over the last 10 years that it really wanted to achieve that goal&mdash;if it accepted that the parliament had that right&mdash;and had organised its program so that the parliament had a reasonable time to debate its legislation, we would not have a problem today. There would be no need to look at some form of restriction being placed upon either sessional or standing orders because the very reasonable requirement of the parliament would have been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament does not set the program; the government sets the program. But, in our view, the parliament has the right to have a reasonable time to consider that legislation. I do not care whether we are in government or the Labor Party is in government in this regard: when masses of bills are guillotined through either chamber without the parliament having time to consider them, the process does not operate well. We should all regard that as unsatisfactory. We simply do not accept that a government putting good faith into practice cannot organise its program in a way that allows the parliament to fulfil its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not done it because it has not seen the importance of doing so. It means more effort on the part of the government. It means that bills have to be planned in advance, ministers have to give consideration to these matters further in advance, and instructions have to be given to drafting officers. We accept that it requires more effort, but that is effort that we say is part and parcel of accepting the role and responsibility of a minister. Because ministers are not prepared to meet that responsibility at a high level of performance, why should the parliamentary process suffer as a result of that failure?  We say that it should not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take the Senate back through a little history of this matter. This chamber was constantly frustrated by large numbers of bills being introduced at the end of a session and the chamber therefore not having the opportunity for proper deliberation of those bills. Former Senator Macklin, the Deputy Leader of the Democrats at that time, put to the Senate a cut-off date&mdash;it became known as the Macklin motion&mdash;a deadline, usually about a month out from the end of a sitting, whereby we said to the House of Representatives, `If you do not have your legislation before us by this date, it will not be considered by the Senate'. The result was that the Government did get to the Senate by that date legislation it regarded as essential for passage within that particular parliamentary session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was regrettable in some ways that even that motion was necessary; it should not have been necessary. It was an imposition that was placed on the House of Representatives by this chamber to ensure that this chamber could function better. The practice was introduced in 1986, and from the point of view of the operation of this chamber it worked reasonably well. The problem was that the government stacked up its bills in the House of Representatives against that cut-off date. A month before the end of the sittings of the House of Representatives, in the last few days before that cut-off date, masses of legislation was being introduced. The government said that it had to be carried in order for it go to the Senate, and it was all being guillotined through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inadvertent effect of the Senate's motion was that, although it helped the processes of this chamber, it was being used by the government as an excuse to avoid proper debate within the House of Representatives. That was unsatisfactory and, not surprisingly, members of the House of Representatives complained to us about it. A government, properly planning, would have introduced that legislation earlier within the House of Representatives so that that House had adequate time to debate it. But because the government had the numbers, because it knew that it could impose the discipline, because it was not interested in the parliamentary process, it did not do that. It simply introduced masses of bills at the last moment and pushed them through the House of Representatives in the early hours of the morning, accusing us of being the cause of that unsatisfactory process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After some years of looking for ways to improve the process, we decided last year not to go ahead with the Macklin motion in this place. We have constantly said that we did not go ahead with it not because of the benefits that it brought to this place but because it needed to be further developed and further improved. As a result of that, the idea of the double deadline was conceived. I am not sure who was the first to come up with the idea of a double deadline. The Clerk of the Senate was accused by government members; some have claimed credit&mdash;because it is really quite ingenious. Notwithstanding the question of who devised the idea, it is a concept that will not only allow us adequate time to debate legislation but will also ensure that the House has adequate time to debate that legislation, and therefore we will not be accused of destroying the legislative process at the other end of this building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Clerk was asked by the opposition whether he would have a go at doing some drafting of this proposal. Unbeknown to us, apparently he was also asked by the Greens. I suspect that he was probably asked by the Australian Democrats as well; I do not know. We do not know what the Clerk is doing for other senators. The Clerk responds to the requests of individual senators and parties and keeps it totally confidential. The Clerk certainly suggested some forms of drafting, and it looks as though his drafting may have been adopted, at least in part, in the Greens' motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the motion would be that, in just under seven weeks from the budget, the government would be expected to introduce into the House of Representatives the bills it wished to deal with in the session. The House then would have roughly a month to deal with those bills. They would have to reach us in time to allow us another month to deal with them. In an orderly way, therefore, the parliament would have a reasonable time to fulfil its constitutional responsibility of debating and deliberating the legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reasonable objection to that, I would have thought, is that the government could say that it was insufficient time. Until the government really has a go at it in good faith&mdash;and Senator Gareth Evans has talked a lot about good faith today&mdash;we will not really know whether that is so. We suspect that, with proper planning, there would be very few bills that could not reasonably meet that deadline. We heard from Senator Evans that seven of the budget bills were introduced last night and he expects another 11 or 12 bills. I would have thought that already considerable attention would have been given to the format of those bills. The government has about six weeks to have them settled. With all the resources of government, it does not immediately strike me that that is an impossible task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the government's program, other than the budget bills, we now know. We have many of those bills, and others, presumably, are in an advanced stage of drafting. We seem to be left with Senator Evans's advice today of the wool industry package, the ATSIC package and the Qantas package. From what we know of what the government is intending to do with Qantas, that is not a complex drafting task. In a former life I did a bit of parliamentary drafting and I have some idea of what is involved. It takes time, it takes skills, but there are some very skilful draftsmen working for this government. With respect to the wool industry package, I presume the difficulty is that as a result of the Garnaut report it will be some little time before the government's deliberative process has been completed, but it may not be such a difficult drafting job thereafter. I am not sure what the government is proposing in relation to its ATSIC legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the vast bulk of the government's program for this session can be introduced within this time constraint. I should make it absolutely clear that our approach is that if there are bills that are particularly urgent or complex or have arisen out of, let us say, the wool industry process taking some time, and there is a strong case made for the carriage of those bills within the session and a strong case made that it has not been reasonable to expect the drafting within this time constraint, then we would waive the constraint. We are not through this process seeking to block the legislative program. What we are seeking to do is to improve the process. Without the strictures that are imposed by a motion such as Senator Chamarette's, unfortunately it is not going to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat what I said earlier: it is not our wish to put in place restrictions of this type. If the government had its program in order and demonstrated good faith&mdash;the sort of good faith that Senator Evans talked about today but which we have not seen from the other end and from the government planners in the last 10 years&mdash;it would not be necessary to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe that the Chamarette motion which over the past year or so has received wide discussion in principle&mdash;it is not as though it has suddenly come from nowhere&mdash;is a worthwhile reform to adopt on a trial basis. It would operate on a trial basis for this parliamentary session up to Christmas; further consideration can be given thereafter as to whether it ought to be continued, varied or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternatives that we have are those from the Australian Democrats and the Greens. It is interesting that when the Greens proposed its motion, the Democrats adopted a different position&mdash;a position that seems to be almost identical to the position of the government. I presume that that is just coincidence. I would have thought that the Australian Democrats would have been searching for ways to improve the Macklin deadline and would have been enthusiastically embracing a reform process which would take the Macklin deadline one step further and overcome the difficulties that were found in its operation at the other end of this building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be quite fair, the Australian Democrats have clarified what was in their earlier press release&mdash;I have only just received the clarification. It seems to reimpose the Macklin deadline&mdash;the deadline at this end of the building&mdash;and we are not surprised to hear that. But there does not seem to be anything in the Democrats' proposal that overcomes the problem which I have put to honourable senators of the legislation stacking up against the deadline in the House of Representatives and the Senate receiving the blame for that unsatisfactory aspect of the process. The government does not seem to address that problem either. The government also has given undertakings for bills to be before the Senate by a certain date, but that does not overcome the problem at the other end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to concede that the government has at least gone a little further; I think the Government has tried harder on this occasion. Senator Evans and Senator Faulkner might be the start of a new breed of leaders in the Senate&mdash;I do not know.

The list of bills that the government has produced at the start of this session&mdash;which is first time I can recall it occurring that way&mdash;is helpful to the parliamentary process, and we appreciate that. Senator Evans said that the aim was to try to plan the program on the basis that a third of it is dealt with in each of the first, second and final thirds of this session, and I think that is taking a step in the right direction. However, our problem is that we have had a decade of promises and the government has not produced a program that is satisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing I touch on one other aspect&mdash;I do not want to dwell on it&mdash;and that is how disappointing I found the fact that the government thought that a way to help defeat this process was to attack the clerk. A spokesman of the Prime Minister, in backgrounding the press, said, `If we had our way we'd get rid of him'. We know that is the way Mr Keating operates in relation to senior public servants who might hold views different to his, but he does not have that authority over the officials of this chamber. We will do our best to protect the officials of this chamber because they are absolutely critical to the proper functioning of democracy in this country. In my 12 years' experience in this place, I have not seen any example of where they should be criticised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before that, from time to time, I might find it frustrating to stand here watching the clerk whispering alternatives to Senator Button, ways to defeat motions that I am proposing.

The clerk should be entitled to expect that that position and that integrity will be protected by all senators in this place, including government senators. I hope that Senator Loosley, whom I respect, will come in here at some appropriate time and apologise for the article in the press that he wrote attacking the clerk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that slight diversion which I think is nevertheless relevant&mdash;because the attacks related to the clerk playing a role in drafting for senators in this matter&mdash;I trust the Senate will see the merit of this proposal and support it today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose Senator Chamarette's impractical and counterproductive motion. I say at the outset that, with all the best will in the world, with an absolutely massive drafting effort&mdash;the like of which we have never seen before&mdash;the logistical constraints and the timetable which would be imposed by Senator Chamarette's motion cannot be met. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant amount of budget legislation simply cannot be drafted by 1 October. That is partly due to the limited drafting resources that exist, and partly due to the time available to refine the details of new policies which were announced in the budget. Of course, that time will be curtailed. The same goes for some other legislation. This is not to mention urgent and unforeseen legislation that comes in to the parliament&mdash;something that occurs in every session, as all senators know. There is not a lot of legislation in that category but there is always some.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say that the quality of the legislation that  comes before the parliament would suffer if this motion were agreed to by the Senate. Mistakes in bills which otherwise would be picked up in time would be overlooked because of inadequate time for checking. Bills would not be as well written as otherwise they might be, and time would be lost in making the consequential amendments. This proposal, if agreed to, would be counterproductive in terms of time. Also the fundamental principle must be stressed that this proposal would be seen as nothing more or less than an interference by this chamber in the business and the conduct of the House of Representatives. It would be a very significant and unnecessary irritant in relations between the two chambers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette is making a most extraordinary demand&mdash;namely, that all legislation must be into the House of Representatives by 1 October and out by 29 October. It is absolutely inappropriate for a so-called house of review to impose those sorts of constraints on the business of the house of government. I know that some in this chamber, such as the Australian Democrats, have recognised that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions which Senator Chamarette wants to attach to the exceptions to this cut-off procedure are also completely unacceptable. Senator Chamarette would probably accept that the only reason those conditions appear is that I have raised with her for a very long time the issue of budget and urgent bills. The proposal for a time-wasting procedural debate, which is put forward in her motion, will on every occasion bog this chamber down in more procedural guff than we have even at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that Senator Chamarette is not motivated by ill will in moving this motion. However, I believe&mdash;I have said it to her directly, and I will say it publicly today&mdash;that this proposition is extraordinarily naive. I do not believe that she genuinely fully understands the ramifications of these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe that the opposition does understand the ramifications of these proposals. It particularly understood the ramifications of a cut-off motion, a Macklin motion, at the end of the budget session in 1992 when it thought it would win the next election, so it decided it would not have any constraints placed upon it. That just shows the utter hypocrisy of the position that the Liberal Party is putting up in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, last year's cut-off was just a doddle compared with this one. But the opposition opposed it then. Where is its consistency? Where is its principle? That was done at a time the opposition thought it had some prospects of becoming government. Now it examines every single issue before this chamber from the perspective of being Her Majesty's loyal and perpetual opposition. Opposition members know that they are stuck over there for time immemorial, and they are acting accordingly. At some time the opposition may get a bit of leadership in its ranks and approach some of these issues seriously from the point of view of an alternative government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has seriously looked at what it can do in response to the problems that allegedly exist with its legislative program. We have approached these problems with an open mind and have made a very genuine effort to deal with the legislative log jam that people identify as the cause of this motion. A lot of that legislative log jam would not occur if we did not have the time wasting and filibustering by the opposition that has occurred continually in this chamber. If the opposition stopped wasting so much time in the Senate on matters of little relevance, we all could get on to the real task at hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that the government has already taken some very significant steps to circulate information about the legislative program well in advance of the budget sittings. The non-budget legislation program for the budget sittings was circulated by me, as Manager of Government Business, on 26 July. To be fair to Senator Hill, I think he made some positive comment about that in his contribution, and that was appreciated. I think that indicates the government's goodwill in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The programming has been handled on a cooperative basis in the past. There has been full consultation between me, as Manager of Government Business, other responsible opposition office holders and the whips, as Senator Burns and Senator Foreman, who are in the chamber, understand. I hope and I expect that that level of cooperation can continue into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) made some throwaway line about the fact that the government's proposals and the amendment circulated in the name of Senator Kernot on behalf of the Australian Democrats bore some similarity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, a coincidence or a conspiracy. I believe the Democrats have made a genuine effort to come forward with some constructive and worthwhile suggestions in this debate, and the government has responded to them. Hence, it is true that the paper distributed by Senator Gareth Evans has as its genesis the package of Senate reforms that was put forward by the Australian Democrats.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has gone further than that and has indicated that it can give a best endeavours undertaking to program legislation for debate and passage in this form. These are constraints that fundamentally were raised with the government by the Greens. The best endeavours proposal is to have one-third of the bills proposed for passage this session dealt with by 1 October, a further one-third of such bills dealt with by 18 November, and the last one-third dealt with in the remainder of the scheduled sitting period, which is by 16 December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had those suggestions put to us by the minor parties and Independents, the government is saying, again in good faith and I believe with an open mind, that we will go further than that and we will work towards meeting the objective of introduction in one sittings and debate the next. Obviously, exceptions will have to be made for budget, urgent or unforeseen legislation, as all honourable senators would understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also agreed&mdash;so has the Senate today&mdash;to send off to the Procedure Committee the question of rationalising the hours and days of sitting, times of sitting and the question of the proposed changes to the order of business that have been suggested by the Australian Democrats. We have done that in such a way&mdash;for those who care to examine the motion that was agreed to this morning&mdash;which will allow all parties, including the minor parties and Independents, to get involved in looking at those options for change. I believe that they are constructive and worthwhile proposals. The government wants to see them progressed. It wants to see some genuine change and some reform. We will be approaching the proposals that were made with a very open mind indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other issues that was raised by the Australian Democrats related to the budget being brought forward. That announcement has already been made and it will require some change to the pattern of sittings. We have also been able to make commitments about the forward program of legislation and its being circulated at least three weeks before sittings. As well as that, we have been able to offer all parties and all Independents briefings on all legislation that comes before this chamber. As I say, that is a very honourable compromise to a range of suggestions that were put to the government&mdash;an appropriate response not only to Senator Chamarette's motion but also to the suggestions that were made by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said before that I believe that Senator Chamarette has been operating in good faith. I believe it happens to be misguided good faith; nevertheless, she is not approaching this from a position of ill will. I do not suggest for one minute that the same is true of the opposition. Frankly, that sleazy and opportunistic bunch on the other side of the chamber are experienced enough to know exactly what they are doing and what impact it has on the processes of good government. Of course, those opposite are unprincipled enough not to care about it because they know the situation that they find themselves in in Australian politics. This proposal from Senator Chamarette could never be embraced by a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said this before and I stand by it: it is a constitutional impertinence, a constitutional affront, for the Senate to dictate to the House of Representatives its own procedures. No government can accept that. The opposition claims to respect the Senate and claims that its processes are vital to Australian democracy. But by supporting this motion the opposition is just setting out to destroy that sort of role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only been in the Senate a pretty short time&mdash;four years&mdash;but I have heard such an amount of sanctimonious, sickening, claptrap from the opposition about the role it plays as a house of review. Now, all of a sudden, it is all a movable feast. We are now told that the Senate can reserve the right to say exactly what it will review. If this motion gets up, we are really saying that we can dictate to the House of Representatives, the people's house, what legislation it will deal with and what legislation will pass through the parliament. I have to say that it is simply not on for the Senate to make those demands of the House of Representatives. No serious government, and no serious alternative government, could ever embrace such a proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have introduced new procedures and deadlines to ensure that legislation is ready for introduction much earlier than in the past. We have indicated that we can be confident that we can have half in by 21 October and the rest by 18 November. We can give an absolute assurance on that. We have endorsed the principle of introduction in one sittings and passage or debate the next. We will be working towards achieving that for non-budget legislation over the next few sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move closer to that goal, an increasing proportion of legislation will be available not weeks but literally months before it is debated. We have introduced the practice of circulating well in advance of sittings a global legislation program, which includes a brief description of each bill. That is in addition to the usual forward program. Of course, such a program was circulated for these sittings on 23 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in order to assist honourable senators in their scrutiny of legislation, we have undertaken to make briefings available on all bills. I, as Manager of Government Business, and the Leader of the House have written to all parties and Independents about that. That is being considered by honourable senators. As I said, there will soon be a serious examination in the Procedure Committee on those other elements of the Democrats' reform package.

Given the timing of the budget&mdash;and I am so pleased that it is being brought forward to June next year because I think that will help us eliminate some of the problems we are now facing&mdash;is it reasonable to say to a government, `You must have all of your legislation in by 1 October'? That is the first problem. I think that is unworkable and unreasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem that I have relates to part (3) of the motion. Part (3) sets up golden opportunities for hijacking and obstructionism. At 10.25 p.m. in May this year the Senate was debating the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park levy bill. There were two speakers still to be heard, one of whom was Senator Chamarette. They had agreed to speak for 10 minutes. We thought it was reasonable to negate the adjournment to let two people finish speaking. It was a non-controversial bill. But what did the opposition do when the adjournment was negated? Speakers were wheeled in to speak at the first reading stage on anything that contained the words `tax' or `levy'. I remember explaining this to Senator Chamarette. This is a typical example of a spoiling procedure which is trotted out by the opposition when it is feeling petulant and churlish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this motion&mdash;and it is probably unintended&mdash;is that it will be up to the Senate to debate every request that is made to classify a bill as being urgent or arising out of a budget statement. We will probably get down to debating definitions. We will have to debate questions such as, `Is this a package or is it not?'. That is what can happen in the Senate when we do not have people of goodwill prepared to use this chamber for constructive purposes. I really do not want to give the opposition an opportunity to use a loophole to exploit the processes of this chamber. That is one of the big problems I have with Senator Chamarette's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem I have is the inconsistency/hypocrisy of the opposition. Last year it denied the Australian Democrats the right to move what is called `the Macklin cut-off motion'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part 2 of my amendment I say to the government: if you do not meet our requirement of having half of the bills introduced into the parliament by 21 October, you suffer the consequences of having all the rest of those bills deferred to next year. I think that is a huge sanction and a huge challenge for the government to meet; it is willing to meet it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part 3 of my amendment I say to the government: if you meet the challenge of part 2, the second half of your bills must be introduced by 18 November. So this forces a two-stage process of introduction. The government, in its best endeavours, has gone further than that and has said that it will introduce legislation on an introduce-one-session debate-the-next basis, to the extent that this proves possible. This is something we have not had before either. Again, here is an opportunity for scrutiny, deliberation and further briefings, where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of my amendment simply follows the same suggestion as Senator Chamarette's motion: it is a standard part which does not prevent committee inquiries. Parts 5 and 6 of my amendment are standard as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to come back now to some of the points that have been made so far in the debate. I am glad that Senator Faulkner set the record straight, for Senator Alston's sake. The government's proposals have been put forward. The 50:50 share and cut-off dates have been proposed by the Democrats and the government has shown that it is willing to meet those deadlines and that challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go back to Senator Chamarette's motion, people have talked about the power of the double deadline. I think the real disadvantage of the double deadline would be that corners would be cut. We would have perhaps shoddier legislation than we already have in this chamber. In terms of efficiency, the real time is lost afterwards when we have to spend so much time fixing up the problems of legislation introduced under a guillotine, rushed up here, often having to be amended, with 25 government amendments to one bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' motion, contrary to what has been asserted by the opposition, does not repeat the Macklin cut-off. It goes much further. Let me say again that it requires a full list of the bills and summaries to be dealt with this session to be tabled less than two weeks from now. That is a massive improvement on what we have had in the past. The motion requires half of those bills to be in the parliament by 21 October and the rest before 18 November. It requires much earlier introduction and therefore gives us much greater time for scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is sensible to marry the government's undertaking with the sanctions and the workable nature of the Democrats' motion, and add to that the matters which have gone off to the Procedure Committee for report back by the end of September. Hopefully, at the end of this year, if we were all prepared to examine these with our conscience and with goodwill, we would have a reformed Senate, a much better place for debate, and a much better place for us to work in. That is my hope, and that was my intention in moving for a wider range of Senate reform proposals. I commend my amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

It has enabled Senator Chamarette in particular to detail her proposal to the chamber and it has enabled Senator Faulkner to indicate to the Senate the government's objection to that proposal. It has also enabled Senator Kernot to make a most constructive contribution to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been certain statements made here which are political in nature&mdash;not that much that is said here is not of that nature. I am really talking about the statement by Senator Faulkner that Senator Chamarette's motion is constitutionally impertinent. I do not quite know what Senator Faulkner means by that, but I would have thought that one of the greatest of impertinences has been the way the government has treated this chamber over a period in respect of its duties to review legislation. It has not given us proper opportunities to exercise that function in respect of a number of important pieces of legislation over recent years. That is the impertinence. It has been acknowledged all round the chamber, I believe, that that sort of interference&mdash;indirect interference, if you like&mdash;cannot continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have been very interested to hear a logical, consistent and compelling case put by a member of the House of Representatives, or someone on his or her behalf in this chamber, as to how we would be interfering with the House of Representatives if we passed Senator Chamarette's motion. In my view, there has been no such compelling argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the problem in two parts: one is an individual problem and the other is a collective problem. The individual problem we have with legislation that comes before us is that we do not have sufficient time, in many instances, to know the principles behind the legislation and the details of that legislation before we debate it in this chamber. Therefore, the scrutiny of that legislation is inadequate. The ability for members of the public to make their representations to us on the legislation is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the government&mdash;and it has been rejected&mdash;why the instructions delivered by the instructing departments to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel cannot be tabled in the Senate and in the House of Representatives when they are received by the OPC. What is wrong with that? We would then have advance notice of what the legislation is intended to do. We would have detailed instructions by the instructing department about what the bill should contain. Why should we not be entitled to the first draft from the OPC? Why should that not be tabled in both houses of parliament? I indicated that, if that were to be the case, standing orders should be amended to prohibit debate at that stage. There is a standing order which, as honourable senators know, prohibits debate in anticipation of a matter that is currently on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, but that would not be sufficient. We would have to amend standing orders to ensure that there were not two bites at the cherry, as it were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my way of thinking, that would give not only members of the Senate but also members of the House of Representatives a fairer opportunity to examine what the bills would most likely contain and therefore to address their minds to it well before the bills came into either of the houses. I am not talking about confidential cabinet material. We are assuming that cabinet has made its decision. We are assuming that the minister concerned has made the public announcement. We are assuming that the instructing department has then issued detailed instructions to the OPC. Why can we not get hold of those detailed instructions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A suggestion has been made to me that it might be embarrassing. I have one thing in mind. I give honourable senators an example, and I think many will understand what I am saying. The suggestion of amendments to the Industrial Relations Act has been around for some time. A decision has been made by cabinet; an announcement has been made by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton. For example, enterprise agreements are proposed to be permitted under the Industrial Relations Act which do not require the approval of a union. As I understand it, Mr Brereton has guaranteed the ACTU that the provisions of such enterprise agreements shall not contain terms and conditions less than the terms and conditions of the relevant federal award. This is because a number of people were, quite justifiably, concerned that these enterprise agreements would be used to undercut the hard-fought terms and conditions of federal awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see what the instructing department has done with that policy and what it has said to the OPC about that. Why should we not know that? This is not a secret society&mdash;or it should not be a secret society. This is a government decision taken by cabinet and announced by the minister. There is no secret about it. Why should we not be permitted to have the instructions of the instructing department when they are received by the OPC? As well, why should we not have the first draft of the bill when the OPC has dealt with the instructions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that there could be an embarrassment in all of this, as very often changes are made because the OPC has said, `You cannot do it this way; you have to do it that way'. So what? That is part of life. We are mature members of parliament&mdash;or we should be. These sorts of processes can be helped by us and by the public. After having a look at the draft legislation, the public would be able to say, `I do not think this quite meets the government's intention when it made its decision'. But the government says we are not entitled to that. For the government's information, we could be entitled to it if the Senate adopted a motion for an order for its return. At some stage in some of these matters we ought to look at that. Through a motion we ought to order a particular instructing department to return the drafting instructions on certain legislation for tabling in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is beside the point. For the purposes of this exercise, and for the purpose of giving us desperately needed advance information, the government is not going to go along with that. What it is prepared to do is contained in the undertaking given by Senator Evans and in the amendment moved by Senator Kernot:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.That there be laid on the Table of the Senate, not later than 6 pm on Monday, 30 August 1993, by the Leader of the Government in the Senate:</PARA>

<PARA>I have seen such summaries of contents. The summaries of contents that we sometimes see relating to legislation are  pretty pathetic and do not give us much to properly examine in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in that sense the amendment moved by Senator Kernot does not fill the bill so far as I am concerned. I suppose it could be suggested that nor does the motion of Senator Chamarette. But it is more likely that we will have the opportunity of seeing the details of legislation and the second reading speeches earlier under Senator Chamarette's proposal than we would under Senator Kernot's amendment. Therefore, in that sense, it does assist individual senators in the exercise of their function, including their representative function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions we have been met with legislation brought into this chamber on one day and debated on the next. How can we consult the persons who are likely to be affected by that legislation, and thus give them the opportunity to give us information, so that we can represent their views in this chamber?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans focused on paragraph (3) of Senator Chamarette's motion. He seemed to be indicating that paragraph (3) has the potential to bog down the Senate in debate on these issues. Paragraph (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This order&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the order relating to when the Senate will debate bills, et cetera&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">may be suspended by motion on notice, subject to the time limits on debate on motions to suspend standing and other orders, in relation to bills arising from the budget statements or urgent bills.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether Senator Evans has cottoned on to the implications of standing order 142. Standing order 142 deals with the meaning of urgent bills. If I were Senator Evans, I might have grabbed this with both hands. I see some confusion between this proposal, were it incorporated into the standing orders, and standing order 142. Standing order 142 deals with urgent bills and is entitled, `Limitation of debate on bills'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) When a motion for leave to introduce a bill is called on, or when a message is received from the House of Representatives transmitting a bill for concurrence, or at any other stage of a bill, a Minister may declare that the bill is an urgent bill, and move that the bill be considered an urgent bill, and such motion shall be put forthwith without debate or amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) If that motion is agreed to, a Minister may forthwith, or at any time during any sitting of the Senate or committee, but not so as to interrupt a Senator who is speaking, move a further motion or motions specifying the time which (exclusive of any adjournment or suspension of sitting, and notwithstanding anything contained in any other standing or other order) shall be allotted to all or any stages of the bill, and an order with regard to the time allotted to the committee stage of the bill may, out of the time allotted, apportion time to particular clauses, or to particular parts of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>As you know, this is a time limitation on urgent bills. If paragraph (3) of Senator Chamarette's motion is limited to urgent bills, then the way is opened up for ministers to declare that certain bills are urgent bills and then to move for limitation of debate on those urgent bills. That is the problem that I see with this paragraph of Senator Chamarette's motion. I understand that it was the government that wanted it in. I am a bit suspicious about that. It is interesting that the government was saying, `What about urgent bills, and what about budget bills?'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The last meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General was held in June this year and unfortunately not all jurisdictions were able to give a final indication as to whether they wanted to participate in an international prisoner transfer scheme. As a result, Australia's participation in such a scheme is still to be settled. The states and territories are important because returning prisoners do need to be held in prisons in the state or territory with which they are connected. Despite the fact that agreement has not been reached, the Commonwealth's position still is to favour, in principle, a transfer of prisoners by way of such a scheme. We remain committed to that, and the idea remains on the agenda to be discussed by attorneys-general in November this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proposal does go ahead, however, in terms of where we would start with the rest of the world, the first step would be to seek to become a party to the Council of Europe convention on the transfer of sentenced persons. As well as that, there is a Commonwealth scheme that we would seek to participate in. This does not cover Senator Colston's concern with the transfer of prisoners from Thailand. We would treat Thailand as we would any other country; we would try to enter into bilateral agreements with it. Thailand is particularly important, as Senator Colston has said, because Thailand is the country where the largest number of Australians are currently serving terms of imprisonment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I hope that he will attempt to give a more honest answer to me than that which he gave to Senator Hill. I refer Senator Evans to the three claims that the Treasurer made at the conclusion of his budget speech last night; namely, a path leading to an Australia which saves more, a path leading to an Australia which can invest more in its own undoubted strengths, and a path leading crucially to more jobs for our people. As the budget reveals a significant fall in household savings, no improvement in business investment and a token fall in the unemployment rate solely associated with a drop in job seekers, with no fall in the number of unemployed, why do the Treasurer and the government persist in telling the electorate lies? When will the government take action to achieve the three key objectives the Treasurer identified but failed completely to address?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="197" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt whatsoever that government policy as spelt out in the budget will contribute very dramatically to the achievement of those three objectives. Let me explain why. The first thing the budget does is inject a fiscal stimulus into the economy&mdash;a modest one, measured of the order of about $2 billion, but significant nonetheless and one that is clearly needed in the present environment where the job market is, as we all know, still flat and likely to remain so for as long as international full-scale economic recovery is denied us. But there will be that degree of stimulus and that is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is a part of a very responsible total economic strategy&mdash;one that does not just consist of the budget itself, but also of a wages policy, a monetary policy, a micro-economic industry policy and, of course, an employment and training dimension to that policy designed to improve our skill base and assist unemployed people to haul themselves back into a job market that is changing quite dramatically in its characteristics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the budget itself is a totally responsible one. In the context of a number of criticisms that are being directed at it from particular sources, I think it is important to acknowledge that not one single economic commentator that I have seen has described it as other than a responsible budget, measured in economic terms, in terms of creating a long-term environment of business confidence, overseas investor confidence and overseas financial market confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason it has been so characterised and deserves to be so characterised is, firstly, that it is a responsible budget. It does show how the medium-term fiscal target for 1996-97 is going to be achieved. We have got that current stimulus being injected into the economy. Nonetheless, it is not just an open-ended stimulus; it is part of a total strategy designed to bring the budget back into balance in four years time by a pathway that is clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it is a budget in which all the election commitments which have been honoured in it&mdash;131 of them are documented in that particular booklet that was circulated last night&mdash;are being funded not by revenue increases but by other reductions in outlay. It is a totally responsible budget from that point of view.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Evans has just said, this is a balanced and responsible budget. One of the most vital features of it is the emphasis it gives to encouraging Australian exporters, in particular the emerging exporters that have been identified in the McKinsey review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia exports now about one-fifth of all it produces. Our objective is to lift that percentage of GDP even higher and put this country in the front rank of major exporting economies in the world. A pleasing feature of our current export performance is the massive growth in manufacturing exports, particularly in the exports of elaborately transformed manufactures and in the growth of services exports out of this country. The market area for most of that growth has been East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have seven of our top 10 markets in East Asia. In the early 1970s we had only two of them there; seven of the 10 are there now. In the last five years, particularly in elaborately transformed manufactured goods, we have increased our exports to the North East Asian region by 23 per cent and to South East Asia by 27 per cent. So we have seen a magnificent growth in the export of manufactured goods which as a category now ranks equal to that of agricultural exports out of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, the McKinsey-AMC study found that the emergent exporters, the small to medium companies in this country that are doing well, have managed to double their export earnings since 1986-87. They now earn&mdash;there are some 700 of them&mdash;at least in terms of this study, $8 billion in export earnings. That was an important finding, added to the fact that in the next five years they expect to double that $8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant finding is that there are 6,000 other companies in the manufacturing sector in Australia that also could export their product and earn significant export dollars for this country. How to energise them and encourage them to participate in exporting is a major question for the government and a major finding of the McKinsey report. We have now put in place a series of incentives to help and assist them to meet the particular strategic requirements of these companies and get into the export area&mdash;most importantly into East Asia where the economic growth for that region, if you leave out Japan, for this calendar year is about 8 per cent and where there is real demand for the types of goods that we export.</PARA>

What does the Minister think the true believers feel about this government's total lack of direct action in terms of job creation&mdash;not more and more training but job creation&mdash;for Australia's 900,000 unemployed? What does he think the true believers feel about a Labor government handing down a budget which, because of massive petrol and sales tax hikes and completely inadequate compensation, will make lower income earners worse off?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="199" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as the question of job growth is concerned, I think I have already answered that. The only way we can generate jobs on a sustainable basis in this country is through a total economic strategy which touches all these bases&mdash;fiscal, monetary, wages policy, enterprise bargaining, productivity and the like, a continuation of micro-economic reform plus the skill base increase training programs that are part of that total picture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point in thinking that we can generate major increases in employment or significantly reduce unemployment through specific big spend-up job creation programs of the kind that we have had in the past. It is the case that a significant increase in spending on public infrastructure of the kind that was contained in the One Nation program, for example, elements of which are continued through in this present budget as part of the total stimulus I referred to earlier, can make a contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the only sustainable way we can really get job growth in this country of the kind that we all need is by getting total growth up over the four per cent mark, which is the kind of thing this strategy is designed to achieve over the shortest possible time frame but which, of course, is significantly dependent on international conditions for its achievement. We hope that a lot of that job growth is going to come from our own region as a result of increased exports. What my colleague Senator Cook has just said about the particular elements in the program that are designed to stimulate exports into that huge new market alongside us is, of course, also directly relevant to the task of creating jobs. That is a key theme in the budget which should not be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of the social equity of the budget, I think it is the case that this budget has to be seen in the context of the government's overall record. Over the past 10 years the priority has been to assist low income people and families. That is why all our previous tax cuts were directed to low income earners. Honourable senators will remember that we previously raised the tax free threshold to $5,400. We previously lowered tax rates to 20 per cent for income up to $20,700. We also increased the family allowance supplement for low income families. We have increased this in real terms by 75 per cent. The real value of the pension has increased under this government by around 14 per cent. All of those things will be preserved because under this government all family payments, all social security payments, are indexed to the CPI. So any increase in prices as a result of the tax changes will feed automatically into higher benefits for people and families on low incomes. In all these ways, the least well-off are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, in the context of the tax cuts, the special $100 tax rebate for low income earners is designed to extend down to people in the under $20,700 category&mdash;that benefit of $2 per week is enjoyed by people at the lower end of the tax category. The tax changes are worth $2 a week to people on around $23,000. That is put down into that lower level. It is the case that the bulk of the personal tax cuts are quite deliberately targeted at middle Australia because that is the group in this society that has not benefited as much from tax cuts in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other dimensions of the budget strategy speak for themselves. If Senator Kernot wants to ask me about petrol later, I will be happy to answer that in more detail. The short point is that there is a very serious health policy objective and environmental objective underlying that as well as the revenue consideration and that is something which is in everyone's interests in this community to achieve. In particular, I would have thought that Senator Kernot's party would be the first to appreciate the significance of that.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to appreciate that there is a rapidly and dramatically growing new sense of regional community&mdash;an Asia-Pacific regional community&mdash;in which Australia is unequivocally part and perceived of as an active and effective partner which has both a security dimension and an economic dimension. So far as the security dimension is concerned, what was achieved at the Singapore meeting three weeks ago was the agreement to establish a new regional security forum in which not just the existing ASEAN countries and their traditional dialogue partners&mdash;Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea, Canada and the United States&mdash;would participate but, in addition, Russia, China, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea as well. In other words, all the major security players, in particular Russia and China, have been brought together into a regional forum where serious and systematic discussion will take place of the whole range of politico-security issues with which we are intimately and crucially concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was further agreed that the kinds of themes that would be addressed by that forum in the future would be weapons non-proliferation, transparency in both armaments and force structure, military policy generally and strategic discussion, and also development of the concept of preventive diplomacy. There was specific consideration also, of course, in Singapore of some regional security subissues like Cambodia&mdash;which Senator Hill will be desperately disappointed to have to now acknowledge has been a success&mdash;and the situation in Burma, where I am pleased to say there is increasing evidence of pressure being really exerted by the countries that really matter so far as Burma is concerned, namely, its ASEAN neighbours, to produce hopefully a more civilised result there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the equation&mdash;the economics of the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;again there have been some major achievements. The whole existence of APEC is now regarded as thoroughly consolidated. The leaders meeting, which is being convened at the end of this year by President Clinton, unquestionably will go ahead and inject major new momentum and, as our Prime Minister has said, horsepower into that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been acknowledged that alternative views of how the region might move itself forward economically&mdash;like, for example, the East Asia economic caucus concept&mdash;are best regarded as subsets, as components of that larger regional APEC strategy, rather than in any way competitors for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is that in all these ways the members of the region are acting and thinking more alike, identifying common objectives and generally acting and responding to each other in a way that represents a much greater degree of ease and comfort in the relationships between governments and nations around the region than has ever previously been the case. That is exactly the kind of thing that we have been on about in terms of Australian foreign policy and what we have been trying to achieve in our own modest way in the region.

The NHMRC has called for immediate action to reduce exposure to lead, particularly in children aged one to four years.

That did not occur. The truth of the matter is that the impost represented by the increase in the wholesale sales tax will not, in our judgment, make a major dent, in any significant way, in an industry that is booming, that is doing brilliantly well in terms of export markets, and that we fully expect not only to survive but also to flourish locally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister obviously has not been talking to the wine growers I have spoken to in the last 24 hours. Can the minister reconcile the statement by the Treasurer that the primary objective of the budget is jobs with the fact that the Wine Makers Federation of Australia has halved its expectations of wine exports by the year 2000 by $500 million? How can an industry that has been, according to the chief executive of Orlando Wyndham Wines, Mr Perry Gunner, `chopped off at the knees' employ more people when the government increases the tax on wine by 50 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For a start, I do not know what the expectations were that have been diminished in that way. Every projection I have seen about the future of the Australian wine industry demonstrates an exponential growth path into Europe which is fully expected to be sustained, particularly in our own region, as consumer tastes and preferences are dramatically changing and as we expect to get a piece of that action. As we make another effort to come back into the Japanese market in particular, there is nowhere to go but up in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the wholesale sales tax increase we are talking about from 20 to 30 per cent is applicable only to domestic wine sales and has nothing to do with exports. Moreover, in relation to its effect on the domestic industry, the nature of the projections I have seen suggest that there will be no difference whatsoever in terms of the consumption patterns and no impact at all, as a result, on jobs in this industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of those extraordinary remarks by the minister responsible for heritage in Tasmania. I suppose he was trying to divert attention from the gross negligence of the Tasmanian government with regard to heritage matters. Tasmania has more than 1,000 heritage places on the register of the National Estate. It is a state, uniquely, in which heritage is important for tourism and for many other aspects of the Tasmanian economy, yet it has failed to put in place even the most basic safeguards to protect this legacy. It is the only state in Australia without heritage legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It attempts to say that the solution to the problem is for us to introduce the tax measures and that we are somehow dragging our feet. This government announced in February that it was going to do this and it has done it in the first budget after the announcement. The tax incentive scheme for heritage conservation works, which was announced last night, cannot redress all the failings of the Tasmanian government. There may be some very important buildings not on the register of the National Estate which would be registered under proper state legislation. Those works will not be eligible for the tax scheme because they are not on the appropriate state or national register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot make up for the inadequacies of the Tasmanian government, but it is, nevertheless, full implementation of our election commitment, and it will be a very important initiative in a number of ways. Private owners of heritage-listed properties will be able to apply through a competitive selection process for a tax rebate of 20c in the dollar. The scheme will be capped at a revenue cost each year of $2 million, so generating heritage conservation works to the value of $10 million per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important from a heritage protection point of view, but it has broader and important ramifications. For a start, to everybody but apparently the Tasmanian government, heritage conservation work is by its nature highly labour intensive. It creates jobs; $10 million worth of work will create more jobs there than any other $10 million in the construction area. Doing it through the tax system in the way we are is a very effective use of the revenue to generate more jobs. It will generate jobs in specialised trades. Equally important is where the jobs will be created. Very many of the eligible heritage buildings which could well be subject to this important scheme&mdash;and it is not up to us to choose them because the owners have to apply; we cannot go out and pick the buildings&mdash;are in regional areas away from the large metropolitan areas and very many of them are in the regional towns and cities of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to the dilatory attitude of the Tasmanian government on this and some other heritage matters about which I have been in discussion with them, I am very optimistic that they will keep their promise and move to implement some legislation in this regard. I hope they do. The government has moved to stimulate work in the area of heritage conservation. It is very important for the preservation of our heritage, it is very important to create jobs, it is very important for regional development, and it is a very effective use of the taxpayers' money to achieve a wide range of proper economic, social and cultural objectives. We look forward to the cooperation of all states. As we welcome cooperation from the other five, we look forward to it from the Tasmanian government.</PARA>

Last night's budget increased the burden of wool tax on growers from 8 1/2 per cent to 12 per cent. Given that only 4 1/2 per cent is needed for debt repayment, can the minister assure the industry that the rest of the tax will be used only for wool promotion and nothing else?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill interjects, `Who cares?'. The government does care. You may not care, but we do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's position on both wool promotion funding and the wool tax has been known for a considerable time. The wool tax comprises three separate components: first, a tax to help fund the operations of the Wool Realisation Commission, which is responsible for selling the wool stockpile and discharging the wool industry debt; secondly, a wool promotion levy; and, thirdly, a research and development levy. The prescribed levels of each tax component under current legislation are 8 per cent, 3.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also say that in June last year the government reduced the effective level of the wool tax to the debt management component from 8 per cent to 4.5 per cent by declaring a rebate to growers on the basis of stronger than expected performance by the Wool Realisation Commission during the year 1991-92. This gave an overall effective wool tax rate of 8.5 per cent for the 1992-93 year. On 28 April this year the government agreed that there was no capacity to declare the wool realisation rebate for 1993-94 but, in recognition of the current circumstances facing woolgrowers, the return to the 12 per cent prescribed tax rate would be delayed for one year&mdash;that is, until July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Senator Sandy Macdonald is aware that the level of wool tax allocated to wool promotion is recommended to the government by the annual general meeting of the Australian Wool Corporation and that the annual general meeting recommended a rate of 3.5 per cent for the 1993-94 year, which the government has now accepted. In regard to the suggestion to increase the wool tax for promotion&mdash;that runs counter to the government's approach, which aims to reduce rather than increase the burden of wool promotion funding on growers&mdash;the government is actively working with the International Wool Secretariat and the International Wool Textile Organisation to develop a broader funding base to reduce the burden on woolgrowers. I might say as well that the Garnaut report contains some recommendations on wool promotion. Of course, the government will consider those recommendations, along with all of the other recommendations of that report, and respond to them appropriately in due course.</PARA>

It seemed to me that there has been over time great resistance from the profession on over servicing and I think that is the main reason why some of the savings targets were not reached. That being the case, I set about looking at a new regime and talked to the AMA, along with the HIC, about genuine peer pressure and review.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool tax rate is set by legislation at 12 per cent but, in the 1992-93 year, a rebate was provided which in fact had the impact of reducing the tax to 8.5 per cent. As I explained in the answer to the last question, the government has decided to continue that until 30 June 1994, as I am informed, at which point the tax rate will revert to the 12 per cent legislated rate. The rebate, which reduces the amount provided for, has been provided because of the better than expected performance of the Wool Realisation Commission and because of the concern the government has for woolgrowers. It has therefore been able to, for a couple of years, reduce the rate, but the rate will return to its normal statutory rate.</PARA>

<PARA>In an answer to a question by Senator Lees about savings from clamping down on fraud in Medicare, Senator Richardson claimed that, if he were to be involved in putting some figures in the budget, he would make sure that those figures were attainable. He stood here and said that he would make sure that those figures were attainable. How can we believe Senator Richardson? When he was Minister for Social Security, he introduced the data matching legislation, which we in this chamber were very concerned about, and estimated savings of $300 million a year. That is what Senator Richardson said we would get. He stood there and promised us that we would get $300 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition and the Australian Democrats sent it off to a Senate inquiry because we were very concerned about it. I think Senator Spindler was at that inquiry. He will remember that Senator Richardson said, `Yes, we'll guarantee $300 million'. So Australians gave up some more of their privacy for that very reason, and we will see Australians giving up more of their privacy with his attempt to correct Medicare fraud. I am not objecting to that; I am objecting to the fact that Senator Richardson makes promises he cannot keep. He did so during the election campaign and he is doing so again at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data matching never reached anywhere near those savings. In fact, the annual savings from data matching are now believed to have peaked at about $70 million a year. We were going to get $300 million a year. It peaked at $70 million a year, which is less than a quarter of the estimate made by Minister Richardson. So we will all be watching very carefully to see what he will achieve with Medicare since he was not able to achieve his promises in social security. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can tell the Senate where the figure of $310 million came from. It came from the Harvey Bates report that was tabled here which stated that in the United States 10 per cent of the total health care budget went on fraud and overservicing. The total health bill in this country is $30 billion and 10 per cent of that is $300 million. That is where the figure came from. The government has transposed the figures from the American health care system, which is totally different from our own. It has taken 10 per cent of the Australian costs of health care and said there is $300 million in fraud and overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has acknowledged today that he has spent a bit of time talking to people in his portfolio and he has got it down to $25 million. He says it will be $69 million the year after and so it goes into never-never land somewhere along the trail. We will keep him to account on that. After getting back about $250,000 over four years from fraud, it will be very interesting to see how the minister will get that figure to $25 million in the next year. I look forward to seeing where that is going. The minister has the total cooperation of the medical profession of Australia in dealing with fraud. Fraud is unacceptable to any of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to overservicing, it will be interesting to see how the minister goes there. Who defines what overservicing is? What is his definition of overservicing? If people want a health check-up before going overseas and a blood test, is it regarded as overservicing because they want a check before they go away?  Nobody knows the answer to that problem of definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson has the gall to come in and give the other part of the answer to the question in relation to optometry services. The government has selectively knocked off Medicare rebates for people who go to optometrists for eye tests. At least the minister had the ability to blush today in trying to respond to that matter, even though he gave no response to this part of the question. He has selectively attacked the optometrists. Because there are not a large number of optometrists in Australia&mdash;fewer than 3,000 overall&mdash;the government is able to get away with it. I put the minister on notice now that he must put this through by regulation and not just in a budget paper that goes through. But I suspect that is how he will do it so that it will become an issue for a short period of time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), in response to questions without notice asked by Senator Hill and Senator Short this day, relating to taxation measures in the 1993-94 budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to the impression that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) attempted to convey today, this is a government and a budget of deceit, of betrayal, of broken promises, of lies and of shattered credibility. This is a budget that savagely increases a wide range of indirect taxes and charges, that produces a tax hike over the next four years alone of an additional $32.2 billion, and it is a budget that leaves every low income family and practically every middle income family worse off, after Labor governments have mercilessly reduced their living standards throughout the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a budget that offers no hope to the one million unemployed, and particularly the 400,000 long-term unemployed Australians, of finding a job. It is a budget that viciously further hits Australian families who, on top of the increases in their living costs through the increased sales and excise taxes and the other charge increases, will find that even when they are eligible&mdash;there will be only a small proportion who are&mdash;to receive the measly reduction in personal income tax, those reductions will not even meet the increase in tax that they will pay from the bracket creep through the tax brackets that the government's increased taxes and charges will produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget produces a bigger tax take&mdash;an additional $32 billion over the next four years&mdash;it produces more government spending; and it produces a bigger budget deficit. Senator Evans had the gall to try to tell us today that this budget was on target to lead to a budget deficit reduction of some $10 billion by 1996-97. Indeed, this budget deficit is $16 billion compared with the outcome last year of $14.5 billion. It means that in the past three years, including 1993-94, this government will have drawn on the nation's savings to finance its profligate spending and other policies to the tune of no less than $40 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget and the associated government policies will produce a bigger balance of payments deficit. The budget papers forecast the balance of payments deficit blowing out to $18 billion this year compared with $15.5 billion last year and $12 billion or thereabouts the year before. In other words, there will be a 50 per cent further increase in our balance of payments deficit over the past two years alone. Coupled with the 4 per cent plus devaluation in the Australian dollar that is forecast in the budget papers, it will lead to a further huge increase in our debt to foreigners, our debt to the rest of the world and through that, very importantly, there will be a very significant reduction in our sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible that at a time when the government is talking about the problems that Australia has in terms of a lack of independence around the world&mdash;which is absolute nonsense anyway&mdash;it takes policy measures which, more than anything else, damage and reduce our independence and our sovereignty. This budget produces a threefold increase in inflation; it produces a further very significant fall in our national savings; it leads to no increase in investment; and it leads to an inevitable rise in interest rates. This is a budget, as is the government that produced it, that is full of deceit, betrayal and lack of vision. It is a directionless budget of lost opportunity.

But both of those Ministers seemed to be waxing lyrical about the export enhancement measures that are in this budget&mdash;$94 million worth.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 12 months, we had merchandise export increases of nine per cent&mdash;a creditable figure. However, when we look at imports of merchandise, we find that the figure is 17 per cent&mdash;almost double. I would have thought that commonsense demands that when one wants to take action, one takes specific action in the area that lends itself to a particularly broad target. Yet the budget is devoid of any measures that give succour to our industries and enable them to meet, with import replacement strategies, the rising tide of cheap imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely nothing in this budget. Australian industries have been forgotten in this budget; so too have the workers who either now do not have a job or soon will not have a job because the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) do not see that they have a responsibility to do something about protecting our industries. Yet, when we look at other countries&mdash;the United States, Korea, Taiwan and European Community nations&mdash;we find that at very short notice, whenever it is necessary, they do protect their industries and their workers. They are not worried about the theoretical provisions of GATT; they find a way around them. They use article 12 and article 19&mdash;two articles that our government has not been prepared to use in support of our industries and our workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the minister to the article, published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> today, by Trevor Sykes who goes in some detail into the evidence that I have provided to the inquiry into tariffs and industry development.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He came out with the extraordinary response that tax was not being increased. I would like to refer Senator Evans to page 4.19 of the budget papers which shows this: total individuals' tax revenue&mdash;that is, revenue by the Commonwealth from individuals; personal income tax, if I can translate it into simple words that Senator Gareth Evans will understand&mdash;is going up 2.6 per cent. Average weekly earnings are going up by about the same percentage&mdash;2.7 per cent&mdash;according to the budget papers. So, yes, there will be an increase in total individuals' tax collections, despite these marvellous tax cuts as a result of which a low income earner will not be able to buy even a Big Mac each week. Then we come to total indirect tax. We find that the indirect tax bill this year will go up by $2 billion&mdash;$2,000 million&mdash;a 9.1 per cent increase in the budget papers which Senator Gareth Evans was saying did not represent an increase in tax revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get this clear for Senator Evans: inflation will be about 3 1/2 per cent, so that does not account for a 9.1 per cent increase. Private consumption expenditure will be up about 2 1/4 per cent&mdash;that does not make up a 9.1 per cent increase. So here we have consumption expenditure going up 2 1/4 per cent and inflation up 3 1/2 per cent but total indirect tax going up 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How Senator Evans can pretend, with a straight face&mdash;sorry, it is not a straight face; I just noticed that it has broken into a sheepish grin&mdash;that this does not represent an increase in taxation is quite beyond me. We have here something like $3,000 million more tax being collected in Mr Keating's secret hidden GST than in fact was collected in the previous year&mdash;and this is not even a full year's tax collections. Next year they will go up not simply because they will apply for a full year instead of part of a year, as they have done this time, but in addition there will be further increases in the rate applying, for example, to sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine is getting a 55 per cent increase in sales tax this year, but it goes up to a 60 per cent increase next year. I support the comments of my colleague Senator Tierney&mdash;who represents in this chamber the whole of the state of New South Wales and, in particular, the Hunter region&mdash;about the devastating effect that this tax will have on the industry's home base. It is only if we have a sound home base that we can, in an industry like wine, sustain an export component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is not only massively increasing the tax take from ordinary Australians; we are also getting a big increase in the borrowings of government. So not only is the government ripping more out of the pockets of ordinary Australians&mdash;particularly those on lower incomes&mdash;by all these tax rises, which it promised would not take place, but also it is into the market more and more for money. I think it is the biggest public sector borrowing requirement since about 1985. So here we have this double whammy: yes, a big increase in tax revenue; and, yes, a big increase in the demand for money by government in the marketplace. So, yes, interest rates must rise.

The minister, in his answers to Senator Short and also, I believe, to Senator Kernot, made the point that this budget was about jobs. When one reads the budget, the words `creating more jobs' appear more often than the words `I' or `am'&mdash;and it is unusual for the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to do that.

That is a higher figure when one takes into account that the government now estimates that there will be a lower participation rate in the work force. What does that mean? People are used to these jargon-type words. Let me explain it. It means that fewer people believe that they can get a job so they have withdrawn from the work force, and yet the unemployment rate, as estimated in the budget figures, with an anticipated growth rate of 2.75 per cent of gross domestic product, is 10.75 per cent. </PARA>

The government is going to be sucking that out of the economy, sucking it out of the banks and sucking it out of the available pool for investment. That is why no jobs will flow from this budget; it is because the money will not be there for business to invest to create jobs. As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, unless there is investment no jobs can result. So we have a no jobs budget, a high tax budget and, most importantly, a no truth budget. What this country needs more than ever before is truth, decency and honesty from the government, and last night it let us all down. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to speak to the Industry Commission report because it refers to the port authority services and activities throughout Australia. Everyone is aware that, with  the problems we currently have in respect of the current account deficit and the large foreign debt, ports can be Australia's Achilles heel in respect of exports. The Industry Commission has addressed this in some great detail and made a series of recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though I agree with the Industry Commission's recommendations&mdash;and I think most people would agree with them&mdash;let me say just as a note of caution that one should be a little careful about generalisations when it comes to ports around Australia because there are probably no two ports that are similar. One of the recommendations&mdash;this is the area where I have some concern because I think it shows a mistrust of what government can do&mdash;is that they should be `placed in a corporate environment'. They are the words of the Industry Commission. This gives me an opportunity to talk about the port of Gladstone. I would like to concentrate on the port of Gladstone because there is very limited time available. I might say that for a report of this magnitude it is of some concern that one gets only about five minutes on something so vital to the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved indirectly, I suppose, in the port of Gladstone for over 20 years, and I saw that port develop from a tiny little operation at a place called Auckland Point to the stage today where it now deals with over $22 million worth of exports. In recent times, because it is the in thing to do, a lot of people are saying, `Let's corporatise'. The Gladstone Port Authority has been requested to revalue all its assets to today's values. This is the note of caution: one should remember that that whole development at Gladstone, which in today's dollars probably comes to $300 million, $400 million or $500 million, was totally and utterly paid for by the users of that port, so not one cent of taxpayers' money went into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also say that the port of Gladstone is one of the most efficient ports throughout the world. It has been entrepreneurial from the word go. It recognises that it is competing not only with other ports on the coast of Queensland in regard to bulk export trade but with ports around the world, and that has been its philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goss government of Queensland has demanded that the port revalue its assets which, as I indicated, were totally paid for by all the participating companies&mdash;not just the port development itself, but also the deepening of the harbour to allow 200,000-tonne vessels to come through the port. The concern that everybody has is: what is the real motive? No-one objects to improvements in efficiency; we all support that. I, and some members of the board of the Gladstone Port Authority, suspect that there might be an ulterior motive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland state government is now saying, `We want a rate of return on the revalued assets which we did not pay for'. Maybe I am not correct, but I think it is proper of me, particularly in this climate, to draw attention to the probability that I am correct. If a reasonable rate of return&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;is required on assets that were totally paid for by the user companies, then this is another hidden tax on an export industry. The last thing in the world Queensland needs&mdash;the last thing in the world Gladstone needs&mdash;is another tax on the people who use that port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The port of Gladstone has been one of the most efficient ports this country has seen. It has had foresight. It has always been a little ahead of the demand for use, which means that it has been able to take on small users. This has been a major reason why that port is the envy of all ports in Australia. It is a port that overseas users of coal&mdash;coking, steaming, and semi-anthracitic coals&mdash;like to use because of its efficiencies. </PARA>

<PARA>The situation of the explosives factory at Maribyrnong has been extraordinary. This annual report is for the year ended 30 June 1992. We are now in August 1993 and have eventually got it. The report is probably not of much significance because the factory has closed down. The fact is, though, that this report was submitted to the minister and was received by him on 21 January 1993. I admit that the government's attention was otherwise directed as of January. Maybe, among the piles of fibs, naughtiness, misbehaviour and deception that were mounting in every minister's office, this report was shuffled onto one such pile and, therefore, was lost. But the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has a duty to present to this parliament such reports, and this report was not presented in a timely and proper fashion. </PARA>

It is interesting that the auditor's report was signed on 18 December 1992. I admit that that would have made it a little difficult to get it to the Senate&mdash;as one would always hope these reports were dealt with&mdash;before Christmas. Unless there is a special reason, all reports by government authorities should be submitted to the Senate, to the parliament, before the end of the calendar year. The requirements of reporting are very clear in relating to the year to June. This situation is ridiculous. </PARA>

There will be other speakers in this debate and no doubt they will have other matters to raise. Before the suspension of the sitting I was dealing with paragraph (3) of Senator Chamarette's motion and the problems that the government saw in regard to that provision. Senator Gareth Evans raised the issue that that paragraph would create problems for the government in respect of bills that are difficult to draft. For example, he cited the Mabo legislation as one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I am informed that it was the government itself which wished to have that particular paragraph in Senator Chamarette's motion if it were to be passed. I remind the Senate of the wording of paragraph (3):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This order may be suspended by motion on notice, subject to the time limits on debate on motions to suspend standing and other orders, in relation to bills arising from the budget statements or urgent bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier I was making the point that the use of the words `urgent bills' might have certain ramifications having regard to standing order 142. Indeed, it might enable the government to attempt to impose limitations on debate of those bills by virtue of the fact that they are urgent. If these bills were deemed to have the same meaning as they have in standing order 142, it could well trigger the provisions of that standing order. I do not think that that was the intention of Senator Chamarette at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other bills that are indicated in paragraph (3) are bills arising from budget statements. Bills arising from budget statements, as we all know, are a matter of controversy. What is the definition of bills arising from budget statements? I think the best idea is to amend Senator Chamarette's paragraph (3) by deleting the words `in relation to bills arising from the budget statements or urgent bills'. That would mean that paragraph (3) would read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This order may be suspended by motion on notice, subject to the time limits on debate on motions to suspend standing and other orders.</PARA>
<PARA>That would enable the government to move a motion to suspend standing orders and give its reasons why this motion, if it were adopted by the Senate and if the subsequent standing order were adopted by the Senate, should be suspended in respect of certain bills. They do not have to be budget related bills or urgent bills within the meaning of standing order 142. They would obviously be urgent in another sense, but it is for the government then to make out a case as to why the standing order should be suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand why Senator Chamarette included the time limitations in this particular paragraph. She indicated that it is necessary to have a time limit of half an hour in respect of a debate on such a suspension, and I think that is reasonable. Obviously any senator can move an amendment. If the government comes in and says, `We want whole packages of bills to be included in the suspension motion', any senator is entitled to get up to move an amendment. It is for the government to justify its situation. If after half an hour the debate is not concluded, the amendment would be put and if lost the motion put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that I will move an amendment to Senator Chamarette's motion relating to cut-off times for legislation.

Indeed, we had a whole series of such legislation. The Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill 1992, which related to certain definitions, had to be changed. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 1992 was introduced last year to remove uncertainties about the enforcement of laws concerning truth in the labelling of wines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had the Broadcasting Services (Subscription Television Broadcasting) Amendment Bill 1992. I do not suppose the government wants to hear what sort of mess it made of that. That bill was rushed through the House of Representatives. It was introduced on 26 November 1992 and passed on 26 November 1992. No wonder it was a mess. Although it was not given proper attention in the Senate, the government itself recognised the need to bring in four committee amendments. The government was correcting its own legislation, fortunately before it got through, in the Senate. One has to give even the government time to recognise that it has made another blunder. That is one of the reasons we have to have adequate time to peruse governmental legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Employment (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1992 passed last year in the Senate contained four government amendments. One of the things the Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992 was to do was make minor and technical amendments. `Technical amendments' means the government has made another mess, another mistake. I think honourable senators will all remember that this huge package came in on a Thursday and was rammed through by the following Tuesday. The government itself introduced eight amendments because it had made a mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons it is vital to give the Senate enough time to deal with these things properly. For example, there were 12 government amendments to the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill last year. It took two months to get that bill through the Senate. That was just as well because if those government amendments had not taken place, presumably we would have had another bit of correcting legislation. Heaven knows how much it costs to get additional bills, correcting bills, through the Parliament. The process is expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were four government amendments to the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1992&mdash;and so it goes on. There were 53 government amendments to the Disability Discrimination Bill 1992 in the House of Representatives even. That was one of the few bills that took quite a long time to get through the House of Representatives. In other words, the legislative process is in many instances enhanced by giving proper consideration and providing time for that consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what Senator Chamarette's motion seeks to provide us with, so that we do not have the ludicrous situation of last year and the year before where the great bulk of the legislation for the whole year is dealt with in the last three or four weeks of sitting where mistakes are made. </PARA>

I refer to the people who are wrongly taxed, wrongly fined or who wrongly set about on a course of action which may cost them money or jobs. It is these errors that we are here to block. I guess there may be some sections of the legal profession that would prefer that we did not make these corrections, that we did not in many instances force the government to recognise that it has made errors and to note this mass of government amendments to its own bills. We have to give the government time to fix up its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the view that was expressed earlier that Senator Evans should be embracing Senator Chamarette's motion with open arms because it will ultimately save the government money, bring about better legislation and remove the need for matters to come back. Last year the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill required, among other things, corrections to the legislation governing the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. When we look through these bills that were introduced last year we find correction after correction and typographical errors. A lot of quite serious things are typographical errors. This has been going on and on. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 was passed in the Senate with 17 government amendments. That was because the Senate had a reasonable amount of time&mdash;from 7 May 1992 to 17 June 1992&mdash;in which to refer it to a committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Better legislation is what we are here for; we are a house of review.

The government's response is, `Those late nights and that delay is because the coalition has been talking too much'. I say to the government that by our talking about legislation we are giving the government time to recognise its errors before that legislation becomes law.

I commend Senator Chamarette for her attempt to stop it. Of course there is another way for it to be stopped&mdash;that is for the government to be rational and reasonable and do something itself. It should exercise some self-discipline and get its program in proper order. I do not hold out much hope for this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the late 1980s Senate motions setting deadlines for the consideration of legislation came into vogue and have colloquially been called the Macklin amendment. In the past, the cut-off point has usually been late November or late May. The government was not ecstatic at the time these particular reforms were introduced in the Senate but, nevertheless, I think we learnt to live with the deadlines. It meant inevitable changes in the procedures in the House of Representatives and far more rigorous use of the guillotine to meet the Macklin deadline. Because there was more limited debate in the House of Representatives, it probably required more extensive debate to occur in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the Chamarette motion, as it will be known if it is passed, is radically different. It requires legislation to be introduced in the House of Representatives by 1 October&mdash;that is, three and a half sitting weeks after the commencement of the sitting period. Some legislation can be introduced into the Senate up until 29 October. Of course the real key to this is that money bills cannot be introduced in the Senate; they must originate in the House of Representatives. If a money bill is not ready by 1 October, it cannot meet one of the loopholes to come through the Senate first between 1 October and 29 October. I think that will present some substantial difficulties in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether intended or unintended, a consequence is that bills will not come into this chamber through the originating minister between 1 October and 29 October. Traditionally, the way the two houses of parliament operate for the most part is that the minister responsible for the bill introduces it into the chamber in which he or she resides. It then proceeds to the other chamber. Now we will have a less than adequate process where bills that are not drafted by 1 October will be introduced here by ministers who represent ministers in the House of Representatives and thus have less knowledge of the bills and are not making the first definitive statement on it. I do not believe that will be a constructive development in terms of the way the houses of parliament operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The records show&mdash;as do the figures that Senator Chamarette tabled today&mdash;that normally only 15 per cent of legislation reaches the houses of parliament by 1 October. Those senators, such as the Greens, who have had absolutely no experience of executive government, grossly underestimate the work that is required to draft bills and to bring them to finality before they are presented to parliament. This is exacerbated in the case of budget bills. We introduced the budget on 17 August. Under this motion, we would be required to have the drafting instructions of all budget bills not only issued but brought to fruition by 1 October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, what Senator Baume said here today can be reversed: if you put undue and enormous pressure on the parliamentary draftsmen, there will be far more errors in this legislation by inadvertence than otherwise. I accept his argument on this issue, but he also has to accept mine. If we put enormous pressure on the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to rush the bills, there will be many mistakes. With all the ability in the world, this Senate does not always pick them up. No matter how much time we devote to legislation, we are not necessarily capable of picking up every minor drafting error or unintended consequence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be further stated that if as a result of the Chamarette motion we are placed under the pressure of having to get done first all the budget bills&mdash;those with a money element that come out of the House of Representatives&mdash;the drafting of other bills inevitably will have to wait to be introduced into this chamber,  irrespective  of  the  originating minister.</PARA>

I said, `Could this road to Damascus conversion be that there is a federal election coming up next year and that, having stuck it up us for years, you do not want this as a precedent applying to you?'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other corollaries of this proposal, but I will firstly turn to the points made by Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine implied here today that the government was using a sleight of hand when proposing that, in terms of Senator Chamarette's motion, we use the term `urgent bills' as though in some way, under the counter, we are trying to use that provision in the standing orders to then make those bills guillotinable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that Senator Harradine has been making strongly in this chamber is whether the drafting instructions should be released. The government resisted that. It gave it consideration, but totally resisted it. In many cases drafting instructions are under way before the policy decision is made, in anticipation of the policy decision. On occasions there is a different policy decision and new drafting instructions are issued. No rational government, be it Labor, Liberal or anything else, would want to put itself in that political position. What has to happen is that policies are determined, drafting instructions are done and then legislation is released. There is absolutely no way the government would support that proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point should be made. If indeed this motion to put in cut off dates of 1 October and 29 October is carried, I believe there is an absolute obligation on the Senate to see through that program to the end of its deliberation, and that it must facilitate the fact that these bills should be discussed. No-one can presume that they have to be passed; that is a matter for the numbers in this chamber. If those opposite put this sort of cut off date in, never again would the government expect anybody to come whingeing to us saying that they have not done the Christmas shopping yet and they want to go home without completing the legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a natural corollary of this motion and it really should get a pledge from this chamber that those opposite would meet this particular requirement. If we do not, we know that this is just a cynical move.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this motion is unworkable. I believe it is not in the interests of the country. It will put enormous pressures, not only in this sitting but also right through the Christmas holidays, on the staff in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, because that is when they will have to work to meet the autumn deadline. There will be no Christmas holidays for them. It will result in far more mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not put on the record a challenge that this was motivated by Senator Chamarette and her colleague through the worst of motives; I put no such thing on the record. But let me assure the two Greens sitting here today that the support for their motion by senators on the other side of the chamber is the most cynically based possible. They did not support such motions at the leadership level in 1989 or in totality in 1992. They do not believe in it for the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Senator Ray on a number of occasions in the past, and certainly in my time in the Senate, has come into this chamber and put propositions which have made good sense and have not always been apparently motivated by party self-interest.

The bottom line is to say that it is unworkable, cannot happen, the place comes to a stop and therefore we should not, in any way, contemplate interfering with the way the government wants to do business. In fact implicit in all that is that no-one for a moment questioned the first cut off which has been in place since 1986 and which was proposed by Senator Macklin. In other words, the government has accepted that in all that it has said today and simply went on to say that a double cut off date would be totally unworkable because that is dictating to the House of Representatives.

But now seven years on it is quite convenient not to trot that out and not to even criticise the first cut off but simply to use the argument in respect of the second cut off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever anyone had foresight, it has to have been Senator Grimes. I do not know why he got out of this place, but perhaps he had had enough of the sort of intellectual double dealing that goes on on the other side of the chamber. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think a possible outcome of the motion that Senator Macklin has put is that, as a result of the deadline that this motion may put on the other chamber, it may be the case that if an unscrupulous government were in power&mdash;I am not suggesting for one minute that this Government would do it&mdash;there would be an increased use of the gag or guillotine in the House of Representatives, therefore stifling the rights of members of that chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>If ever there was an eerie forecast about what would happen, it is that. Senator Sherry's former Tasmania colleague was absolutely right and damningly accurate in his judgment of the unscrupulous nature and behaviour of colleagues, many of whom were there at the time and are still here now. Senator Grimes was simply anticipating the way in which this government would get around it: the way it would flaunt and flout the very spirit of a proposal designed to expedite the processes of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have had in recent times in the House of Representatives is a whole swag of legislation dished up or held back until the last moment. People are then expected to make a contribution in 15 minutes or less and they cannot even speak to an amendment. The amendments are just referred to at the end of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in this chamber cannot even contemplate the way in which the guillotine and gag motions have been used in the other chamber. So it is absolute hypocrisy to now turn around and pretend that somehow this is dictating to the House of Representatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even if those opposite did, they would be wrong. The Greens have come to this objectively, of their own accord, as any dispassionate observer would. They look at the way the place runs and they ask, `Is this true?'. My family now accepts that I work up here for a living, particularly when I tell them that we sit through the night; I think we did that on nine occasions in the last session. To find that 92 bills were passed in the last third of the last year's budget sittings gives some idea of the way in which this Senate chamber has operated, the way in which the government has shown absolutely no interest in organising the procedures of the place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought that perhaps one of the most breathtaking double standards came from Senator Gareth Evans. He was at pains to contain himself today; it was quite unusual. He was almost the essence of reasonableness. He certainly was not that foul-mouthed individual who blasphemed when he was asked to stop dictating during the proceedings of this chamber yesterday. He certainly was not the bullyboy we often see when he is not getting his own way. There he was, somehow giving the impression that this was all sweetness and light, that the government had come forward with a whole series of compromise proposals which would more than meet any concerns that people might have. To the extent that we still needed to go a bit further, it was a case of `Trust me; we will use our best endeavours; we will get it right'. There is absolutely no reason why anyone should accept any of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, there is no reason why we should not accept the workability of Senator Chamarette's proposal. After all, if the bottom line is simply that there is not enough time to get the drafting right, as Senator Cooney would know, there is any number of underemployed lawyers these days who would be prepared to take on a contract at very short notice. They would probably get paid more than the dock briefs that are accepted on Senator Cooney's side to get up and defend the indefensible on a regular basis. Nonetheless, there would be plenty of people to whom this work could be contracted out. A lot of them would be experts who have actually done drafting work in the past, who have worked in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, and who have all the requisite skills. Whatever one might end up paying them, one would save more from the shortened sitting times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is again demonstrably untrue to suggest that the timetable cannot be met. Senator Ray upped the rhetoric a bit by saying it was unworkable. It is all nonsense. There is no reason at all to presume that a timetable which has been checked with all the appropriate authorities&mdash;none of whom have cast doubts on its workability&mdash;is somehow going to bring the place to a stop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of the sort of casuistry that is employed in this process. After the government had been dragged screaming and yelling into the compromise business, we had a statement recently that its latest proposals had been scrutinised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and it had been assured that that office could meet the government's timetable. But the government very carefully did not say whether the office could meet Senator Chamarette's timetable, and I have no doubt at all that it could do just that. But, of course, it was not asked; and, if it was, it was told to shut up if it gave the wrong answer. So, quite clearly the government lacks bona fides on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to know what this is really all about, we have only to look at the vicious verbal thuggery that was employed by Mr Beazley when these proposals were first put forward and  Senator Chamarette actually had the temerity to stand her ground. Mr Beazley accused both the Greens and the opposition of attempting to usurp the role of the lower house. After the government tried to batter them into submission and did not succeed, Mr Beazley said that the Green senators could leave the government budget legislation just rotting around. I do not have any doubt at all that that is the last thing on Senator Chamarette's mind or, indeed, Senator Margett's mind. They are interested in speeding up the process of government. For the minister to behave in that bullyboy fashion shows the true colour of the government's money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beazley went on to say that we were both supporting moves which would undermine the authority of the House of Representatives, wreck the Government's budget program, and threaten the constitutional relationship. Finally, he said that the community should not have to stand still for a bunch of bitter opportunists perverting the outcome of the last general election. If ever anyone went over the top it has to have been Mr Beazley whom one would have thought is not the biggest thug in the cabinet; I am sure there are much bigger and more effective thugs around the place than him. If that is the line that he runs, we can imagine what those who are minding him were urging him to say and do. The government's conversion to the cause of reasonableness in terms of process is very belated and I would have thought it is totally lacking in any evidence to support its bona fides. Therefore, why should we not accept the bona fides of Senator Chamarette?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray spent most of his time basically trying to attack the integrity of honourable senators on this side of the chamber by suggesting that our motives were entirely impure, that it was simply because we happened to be in opposition at the time. There is no reason to think in the foreseeable future that the numbers in this chamber will change so dramatically that either of the major parties or groupings could expect to dictate the way in which this place operates. I would have thought most objective commentators would say that that was a fairly healthy development. I am sure it outrages and enrages the likes of Senator Richardson; nonetheless, the trouble with democracy is that you actually have to work with people who do not always agree with your propositions. </PARA>

If one goes back and looks at how long it took to put things through, particularly with the committee systems, one will see that there have been dramatic changes in the Senate in the last 10 years, all of which have been designed to give all senators a greater opportunity to understand and examine legislation, to probe, push and seek amendment where necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 July, well in advance of this sitting, the government circulated a brief description of each bill as part of its global legislation program.

If those opposite want to avoid the build-up of that legislation, all I can say is that Senator Chamarette's motion will do nothing to help it because it does not address the delaying tactics that the opposition engage in at the end of every session. It does not even begin to attack the strategy to which I earlier referred&mdash;the strategy to frustrate and obstruct&mdash;that gets us into strife every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is a further problem which cuts right across this motion. The motion has the necessary effect of the Senate imposing constraints on the business of the House of Representatives. Senator Hill earlier referred to the parliamentary process, but the truth is that, if anything could run against the grain of a bicameral system, it is a system where the house of review dictates the timetable to the people's house. That is what will happen today if we pass this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Chamarette has recognised some of the difficulties and she has added a section to the motion to try to address them, but even in that amended form it is just unacceptable to the government because of the conditions attached; that is, each time a budget or an urgent bill has to be introduced notice has to be given the day before. That means a procedural debate on every bill that we regard as budget or urgent. There are some 25 to 30 budget bills every year. I do not think one can really say how many urgent or unforeseen ones there will be because if they are urgent or unforeseen obviously one has not planned them, but let us say there are four or five of those. We are talking about 30 to 35 bills every session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how many hours and hours of time would be wasted on procedural debate if we had to have a debate on the notice of those. I think the potential for time wasting is extraordinary. One would imagine that 17 to 18 hours of Senate time will be wasted for no purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though Senator Chamarette may be acting in good faith, I certainly would not be able to use that expression about the opposition. There is no guarantee that any procedural motion would pass with the opposition as bitter as it is at the moment. One of the real problems here is the opportunistic and hypocritical support for this motion by the opposition. In October of last year constraints far less stringent than those being proposed today came before this place. At that time the opposition was in different mode. Those opposite would not like to remember back to those days. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp does not like this part because he says, `This is where you get stuck into me, please don't do that'. I am afraid that he is just going to have to wear it. If we go back to that period, Senator Kemp certainly had some extraordinary delusions about his possible future&mdash;some would say hallucinations&mdash;and about what might have been going to occur. As he and his colleagues were in this different mode of thinking about it, they rejected that proposal. But now that those opposite realise that they are still over there, that they will be over there for a long time, then of course they change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette should ask herself why there would be that dramatic change in less than a year. The answer is simple: there has been an election in the middle. Since that election those opposite have realised that that period of opposition will go on and on, all they want to do is to frustrate the process of government. That is why they are supporting this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill and the opposition know full well the practical problems that this motion will cause this government. They are not behaving like some constructive opposition; they have just become wreckers. Make no mistake, the Liberals are beginning to revel in that perpetual state of opposition, as we did in the 1950s and 1960s. We loved it. That is what those opposite are doing now because it is all they have got to love. I guess for the opposition there is no place like home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some things never change. Dr Hewson is still there. At the Press Club a few weeks ago Dr Hewson, in the words of Geoffrey Barker&mdash;and I would have to believe him&mdash;said this about being in opposition. Dr Hewson:</PARA>

That is not the job of a house of review. We ought to let the house of review get on with reviewing, get away from the obstruction and allow governments to govern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the original motion put by Senator Chamarette and support the amendment put by my leader, Senator Kernot. In doing so, I would like to pick up on a few of the points that have been made in the debate so far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, it ill behoves Senator Robert Ray to accuse the Greens as to whether or not they have a mandate in relation to this particular question. In fact, the government, which now presumably has a mandate in relation to not raising taxes, moved before the last election to bring in legislated tax cuts which it has failed to do. I think it is not a particularly good argument on Senator Ray's part to raise the issue of mandates with respect to the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But equally I think Senator Alston accused the government of putting forward an alternative proposal that would have to be taken on faith. He said that he was not prepared to take the government on faith with respect to those proposals when Senator Kernot's amendment gives effect precisely to the undertakings which Senator Gareth Evans gave in this chamber this afternoon. So there is an opportunity for Senator Alston to check the bona fides of the government by supporting the amendment moved by Senator Kernot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the government is very much on the line. If that amendment is accepted, the government, as the amendment says, will have to produce by Monday, 30 August, a list of all bills which it intends to introduce in a particular session and to provide a brief description summary of the contents of those bills. It then must have 50 per cent of the total number of bills introduced in either the Senate or the House of Representatives by 21 October. So I think the government has in this instance shown its good faith with respect to those undertakings by saying that it will support the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In support of the position I take on this issue, I would simply point to the fact that although Senator Macklin introduced a cut-off motion all those years ago which seemed to work quite well for a number of sessions, I think everybody who has been in this chamber for a while is aware of the fact that increasingly it has been working less well. That is shown quite clearly by the table which was put before us earlier today in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at that table, we see that in the 1972 budget 63 per cent of that session's bills were passed in the last four weeks; and that in the 1992 budget, a figure of 74 per cent were passed&mdash;not all that different. So if we look at the budget session of 1991, for instance, when only 44 per cent of those bills were passed in the last four weeks, we see that while the Macklin cut-off motion worked for a while and did seem to move legislation into the earlier part of the session, increasingly it has been frustrated. I would have to agree that the government has been frustrated substantially by the efforts of the opposition filibustering earlier in the session, particularly over the appropriation bills in the last session which caused the bank-up of legislation to occur later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to put before the government a number of proposals which will address this whole problem in a much broader way. Let me, without too much cynicism, suggest that perhaps this government could save a great deal of money if it guillotined all bills through the House of Representatives. Matters in that chamber are decided simply on the numbers, bills could be dealt with in a minute or less, it could sit for a day and then its members could all go home. The one thing on which the Democrats and the opposition certainly agree is that this chamber works extremely well precisely because no party in this chamber has the numbers simply to ram legislation through. It is in this chamber where legislation is dealt with properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of giving adequate time for legislation is an important one. We have established an excellent committee system which allows legislation, simply on the call of a single senator, to be sent off to a committee to be reviewed. As Senator Baume himself indicated earlier, legislation had been rammed through the House of Representatives, with no amendment being dealt with in this place over several months, and resulting in a number of amendments. In one case I dealt with, there were 87 amendments in a package of legislation; in another case Senator Lees dealt with, there were 106 amendments in another package of legislation. We in this chamber properly carry out the democratic function of this Parliament. Contrary to what Senator Robert Ray said, that function is not carried out in the other place because of the method of election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with the order in which legislation is introduced, everybody would be aware that we normally sit for a week or a fortnight longer than the House of Representatives because legislation is normally introduced first in the House of Representatives. Perhaps the House of Representatives could begin its sittings earlier than the Senate so that there would be some legislation available for us when we begin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those sorts of reasons that I believe the amendment which has been put up by Senator Kernot is a much better way of proceeding. We have an undertaking from the government that it will support that amendment; it will seek to meet the terms of that amendment. I simply give notice that that amendment is part of a much broader policy which needs to be looked at that will further reform the way in which legislation is dealt with in this chamber. In that way it will be properly reviewed, and properly amended when amendment is needed. Such a process will ensure that the very best legislation is moved and passed in this place for the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to each relevant Senate Minister concerning various media reports to the effect that the government is attaching some blame to me for providing Senator Chamarette with her notice of motion for a "double deadline" for the introduction of bills in the forthcoming sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these reports are correct, they indicate a lack of understanding of the advisory service which I and my colleagues provide to all Senators, including the ministry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would be aware that advice has been proffered to the government on methods of streamlining consideration of legislation. In April last year I wrote to Senator McMullan, then Manager of Government Business in the Senate, and suggested a motion for a "civilised guillotine" which would provide time limits for the consideration of all bills. Attached is a copy of my correspondence with Senator McMullan at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This correspondence illustrates the way in which the kind of advice which was provided to Senator Chamarette is made available to all Senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have also provided the "civilised guillotine" motion to non-government Senators in the course of discussions with them about streamlining the legislative processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the reported remarks of Ministers are potentially very damaging to me, I ask that the advice provided to Senator McMullan be made public so as to give a balanced picture of my role.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Michele Cornwell has agreed to take up the position of Deputy Clerk in the Queensland Parliament, and for this purpose she has been granted 12 months' leave without pay from the Senate Department. I am in the process of selecting an officer to act in her place during her absence, and I will advise you in due course of the outcome. Michele will have left when the Senate sits again on 28 April.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had some indication that some thought may be given to speeding up the consideration of government legislation during the remainder of the Autumn period of sittings. I do not wish to use the word "guillotine", which always raises alarms. That is one of the problems with the guillotine procedures: they have unfortunate associations, and are never applied without some rise in the hostility index in the Chamber. I have long thought that some consideration should be given to some other method of applying time limits to the consideration of legislation. It would be possible to move a special motion to allocate time limits for the consideration of the various stages of specified bills. The motion could provide that the expiration of the specified times would have the same effect as under a guillotine, but could also provide for some of the improvements which I recently suggested in the Procedure Committee, such as provision for non-government amendments to be put and determined at the expiration of the allotted time. It could also be provided that any Senator, as well as a minister, could move a motion for the time to be extended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a motion would not have the same odium as a guillotine, and could be the subject of negotiations before it is moved. It would not require a declaration that the bills in question are urgent bills, which is the start of a guillotine and also the start of the ill-feeling which invariably accompanies that procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you would like to consider this proposal I could draw up an appropriate motion.</PARA>

Certainly, it is true that in the past the government has misused the freedom of action that this chamber has given it, but I believe that there are two sides to that issue. One of the reasons why the Macklin constraint has not functioned well in the last two sittings has been that other parties in the Senate have misused that freedom also. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Mr President, I apologise to those senators who are waiting to make their first speeches. I have several pages of notes which I will attempt to go through briefly because I believe that it is important to maintain a right of reply to this debate. Senator Evans raised three problems. As I go through, some of these problems may be dealt with. Firstly, he said that imposing a cut-off of 1 October was impossible. I simply say that it is an opportunity to prioritise, to defer less important bills and to address the problem in a constructive manner. I realise that it is a pressure. It will not be such a pressure on another occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem needs to be addressed in a constructive way. Some government senators have indicated that they recognise the problem and are prepared to address it. Senator Faulkner has assured us that he intends to address it. I would urge all senators to do the same because of the difficulty the legislative program may present to those who are drafting legislation based on budget bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans's second problem was that he felt that the fail-safe aspects of the motion, contained in paragraph (3), would not be adequate. He demonstrated quite a considerable lack of faith&mdash;in which he was joined by several of his colleagues&mdash;in the credibility of the opposition. I believe that the credibility of the opposition will be at stake if it maintains an oppositional stance after having so clearly stated its intentions in support of this motion. I would much rather give opposition members the benefit of the doubt and allow them to show that to the community than to make allegations against them ahead of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Senator Evans stated that for the Senate to seek to directly determine how the House of Representatives acts is unconscionable and direct proscription. That is nonsense. If it were true, it should apply much more to the amendment that was put forward by the Australian Democrats, for which the Government signified its support. Throughout that amendment there were references to how the House of Representatives should maintain its approach to the legislation, whereas my motion simply refers to the way the Senate will conduct itself. It allows the option of being totally open about how the House of Representatives will respond. I feel that is perfectly appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciated the incongruity, the paradox, that was presented by the Greens both being `extraordinarily naive' and `terribly misguided'&mdash;linked in many ways with all sorts of qualities. Whatever our motives are, a positive solution can be such providing we exercise our political will and work towards it. We have an opportunity to do that with this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government acceded to the requests within this motion, all of us in the chamber would have much less to filibuster about. We would have more notice of, and more genuine issues to raise in regard to, the legislation than to be bothered with any filibustering, which I must confess I have done on occasions. I did it in most notable form in relation to the Migration Amendment Act&mdash;an immoral and scandalous piece of legislation which was pushed through parliament within one day, legislation which pre-empted an appeal to the High Court by the boat people at Port Hedland. So that is the primary motivation by which I came to look at the procedures of the Senate and tried to make some constructive responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as having less to filibuster about if this motion succeeded, there would be community credibility. If the government cooperates with this motion, and the opposition prevents it working in an effective manner, we are accountable to the community. That is essentially the accountability that we should be concerned about in our debate in this chamber. The House of Representatives should demonstrate more concern for accountability to the people, which the submission to the parliamentary process allows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge Senator Faulkner's attempt to deal with the program difficulties that the legislative program presents to all senators, but to the Greens in particular. I commend the government for giving us earlier notification of programs and assuring us of briefings. Those ministerial briefings have commenced. This full communication is very worthwhile. It shows the good faith of the government. It is an opportunity for a new era in the Senate, a chance for us to debate in a new way the legislation ahead of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We all know that there is a problem. Others who have far more experience than I have expressed it. This motion is an experiment. It may not be effective in achieving its goals. It will take all senators and all members of the House of Representatives to cooperate with the spirit of the motion to achieve those goals. If improvements are forthcoming I am more than willing to accept them. This issue transcends party politics. It is of concern to all members of parliament who value their responsibility to due parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked at Senator Kernot's amendment. I would have given a critique of it, but we have already made that decision and so I will leave it out. I would like to talk about Senator Harradine's contribution. It was Senator Harradine who put forward for discussion the use of the word `urgent' and the way in which it could possibly lead to some problem. I would like to say why I put paragraph (3) in my motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner quite correctly pointed out that it was his concern that `budget' and `urgent'&mdash;meaning crucial&mdash;legislation may be impeded by my motion. I took that from him with due sincerity and I tried to make allowances for it through my paragraph (3). However, my paragraph (3) does not actually state anything more than the obvious, which is that, by leave, at any point in any sittings material can be introduced for good reason, and it relies on the good faith of the Senate to pass that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph (3) in my motion was, therefore, superfluous. I did not put it in, because it was superfluous, but when the motion began to receive publicity from Minister Beazley regarding what I considered to be disinformation that it might actually prevent some of the budget legislation getting through to the Senate, I placed it in so that any media who were looking at the motion would be in no doubt that that practice was available. Every honourable senator knows that that practice is available and still remains available for good reason. Therefore, I am happy to accept the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Harradine in which he states that paragraph (3) should stop at the full stop after `orders' and that the words `in relation to bills arising from the budget statements or urgent bills' should be omitted. That does not mean that we cannot deal with packages of bills by leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the challenge&mdash;I cannot remember for the moment who made that challenge to us; I think it was Senator Robert Ray&mdash;that we should take this motion on board and use it for constructive purposes only. That means that, if the government comes to us with genuine needs because it is being pushed by time pressures, we ought to also demonstrate our willingness to cooperate in the interests of making good government decisions and assisting the government in what it is doing by good parliamentary decision making. Senator Ray challenged the Greens mandate. I would love to reply to that, but I will spare honourable senators that response and give it to them at another time. </PARA>

What I do wish to say is that we decided not to accept any offer of staff for two reasons. Firstly, Senator McMullan offered a lower number of staff than we felt was a minimal requirement and linked it in a defamatory way to this procedural motion. We have not taken up the very inadequate offer because we made the request in good faith in relation to our minimal needs, not as an ambit claim. We felt that either it was a legitimate entitlement or it was not, in which case a partial response was inappropriate. Secondly, we refused the offer because of the way in which it was made and the allegations that it was connected in any way with this motion, as it is not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australia approaches the year 2000 and we review the first century since Federation, I am pleased and honoured to be joining my colleagues in this chamber, which has been the repository of fundamental constitutional principles for almost 100 years. At a time when some seek to destroy the finely balanced constitutional system which has provided this country with stable government for almost a century, the importance of this house has never been greater. While it may suit some to describe members of this chamber as `swill', I wish to make it clear that I am proud to be an Australian senator and proud to have the opportunity to participate in this chamber's crucial role of legislative review and close scrutiny of executive action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states of Australia will play an important role in our nation's future, as they have in the past. They are an integral part of our constitutional system and an important check on the use and abuse of centralised power. For the smaller states, in particular, this chamber provides a valuable forum for the consideration of their views. I hope that my time here never prevents my remembering that the role of this chamber, this parliament and the entire executive function of government is to serve and benefit all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1949 Victoria has been continually represented in the Senate by at least one woman senator from the Liberal Party. I am proud to be joining my colleague Senator Patterson in this chamber. Those women who represent the Liberal Party know that they have been preselected on merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been made in recent times of the importance of the women's vote and the need to have more women parliamentarians. I have been gratified by the number of women from the whole of the political spectrum who have spoken to me on this subject and expressed support for my own move into parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party has a long tradition of leadership in women's issues and the successful elevation of women to parliament. The first women elected in each of the state parliaments represented non-Labor parties and the Liberal Party can also claim the first woman member of the House of Representatives, the first woman government whip and the first woman state president of any major political party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian division of the Liberal Party has, through its constitution, equal representation for women at all levels. It was extremely pleasing to see the election of six new Liberal women parliamentarians at the 1992 Victorian state election in addition to the three existing women members. However, notwithstanding these achievements, the fact that there is still only a small number of women in parliament continues to be of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I began my involvement in the Liberal Party from an isolated country town and I have now become a member of the most important legislative body in the country. One reason why women do not enter politics is that it is seen as an all-encompassing career which excludes family, friends and an otherwise normal existence. I know from my own experience and observation of political life that a political career is a seven-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day occupation. Nevertheless, many members of this chamber have decided to devote a major part of their lives to working to achieve the political aims and principles in which they believe. I hope that many more, including many women, will seek to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words of Australia's greatest Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, remain as relevant today as they were in 1948, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Politics is the most important and responsible civic activity to which a man or woman may devote their character, their talent and their energy.</PARA>
<PARA>I am also proud to represent rural women, a group of whom I have been part since my marriage to a farmer 27 years ago. Most rural women do not feature in employment statistics, yet many of them are among the hardest workers in this country. As the level of paid employment on farms has fallen, along with farm incomes, many women now work alongside their partners in the demanding physical work on the farm. This is often in addition to domestic work, volunteer community work, the office work of farm management and work in full-time or part-time employment off the farm to produce a second income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural women make these sacrifices in an endeavour to ensure that their farm is economically successful. Without economic success, all other aspects of rural life become difficult or impossible. The education of children, the provision of health care for farm families and ageing parents and the preservation of a standard of living commensurate with long hours of work on a property are dependent on at least a modest income which today, sadly, farming businesses are not achieving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No group in Australia has been more badly affected by failed government economic policy than the rural sector. The challenge of raising five children in an isolated environment has shown me the true importance of the family. It is the family which provides children with a stable emotional base from which to commence adult life. It is the family which provides a refuge from a troubled world. It provides education, it teaches responsibility and it gives our society strength. The family unit, in whatever form it takes in contemporary Australia, remains essential to the well-being of Australian society. We must not allow its importance to be eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of concern in rural Australia about the future of the family farm. However, despite trends in earlier decades which seemed to indicate a falling rate of family ownership of farm land and an increase in the rate of corporate ownership, that trend has steadied. The well managed family farm has several competitive advantages, including a greater depth of local knowledge and flexible labour costs. The ability to quickly adapt to changing circumstances means that the family owned farm will be an integral part of the rural economy for the foreseeable future. Of the 125,000 commercial farms in Australia, 90 per cent are family owned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the future direction of farming is likely to be in the hands of families rather than corporations, it is essential that farms be run on sound business lines. There is no case whatever for taxpayer support of poorly managed rural businesses, including where wrong investment or production decisions lead to commercial failure. Government should not be in the business of subsidising primary producers every time they meet adverse conditions. History suggests that government intervention in the rural economy does more harm than good. Indeed, in this area, the 19th century philosopher Thoreau was correct in his view when he said that government never furthered any enterprise but by the alacrity and speed with which it got out of its way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no better example of an industry which the government should move quickly to leave alone than the Australian wool industry. The dismal history of the reserve price scheme, which resulted in unrealistic pricing and devastating levels of debt, is a potent reminder that, no matter how worthy the objective, government intervention in markets does not work. As Ross Garnaut's recent review of the wool industry concludes, the future of wool marketing, promotion and stockpile management must rest with the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this practical, not to say hard-nosed, attitude towards the rural sector must be matched by government strategies to raise the profitability of rural industry. Reduced protection for manufacturing industry, micro-economic reform on the waterfront and in land transport and the introduction of more competitive labour markets are urgent and essential reforms that are necessary to ensure a viable rural sector. Without them, the rural sector, a major Australian export earner, is in danger of complete collapse. At a time when some areas of rural production are sadly in need of leadership, a long-term rural policy perspective shows the importance of government incentives directed towards the improvement of skills in farm management and production technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing any vision of the future of our nation, we must reconcile the economic vision with the human vision. Liberal Party policy is directed at removing the cost burden from farmers and rural communities, intensifying the innovative nature of Australian agriculture and restoring economic viability and quality of life to farmers and rural Australia. My representation of rural people, both in the party room and in this chamber, will be directed towards ensuring that their interests are not forgotten and that their voice is heard by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, as a senator for Victoria, I will be working to represent all Victorians. It is for this reason that I will be locating my electorate office in Broadmeadows. Broadmeadows is a suburb on the north-western fringe of the Melbourne metropolitan area. It is an area characterised by the presence of families with young children, an unemployment rate of more than 16 per cent and a youth unemployment rate of between 30 and 40 per cent. The average individual income level is only $13,600 per annum and the annual household income is $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A high proportion of the Broadmeadows population is of ethnic origin. It is an area claimed by the Labor Party to be typical of its heartland, yet it is in Broadmeadows that the true human cost of the failure of federal government policies throughout the past decade is starkly demonstrated. As if this state of affairs were not bad enough, in the last few months the state electorate of Broadmeadows has been deserted by its sitting member, the former Victorian opposition leader, Mr Kennan, as part of a curious and cynical factional deal which has operated to the disadvantage of his electorate and the women in his party and to the considerable expense of all Victorian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The voters of Broadmeadows deserve better political representation. I will be doing everything possible to represent their views effectively in this chamber and to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In common with their rural counterparts, the livelihood of the people of Broadmeadows and similar areas depends on effective private sector management, growth and productivity, assisted by appropriate government policy. Many of the voters of Broadmeadows from a non-Australian background came to this country to escape failed government policy, poverty and a sense of despair. What must their feelings be towards a federal government which has left more than one million Australians without jobs, dramatically reduced average weekly earnings and destroyed the prospects for productive business investment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every member of this chamber must ensure that these tragic mistakes are never repeated. Political events since the election in March, and indeed of yesterday, suggest that our government has learnt nothing other than a cynical desire to retain power at any cost. Mr President, we must never lose sight of the fact that political morality means more than just winning, political compassion means more than just clever speeches and ministerial responsibility means more than membership of the right faction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My political life to date has been in the Victorian division of the Liberal Party. I am very proud to have been a state office bearer in that organisation and to have worked with Michael Kroger, Ted Baillieu and Petro Georgiou.

I also wish to thank Tasmanians who voted me into this position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in fact the replacement for former Senator Shirley Walters.

All Tasmanians are proud of her achievements and I am very honoured to be her replacement. But, Mr President, I wish to assure you that you should not expect the same frequency of interjections from this seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very firmly in the philosophy of the Liberal Party which is summarised in individual liberty, the rule of law and concern for the family.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift,</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that you cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. All Australians have been spending more than we have earned for a very long time. It is no wonder that we are in deep trouble with our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One hundred years ago we were the richest country in the world. This was when gold and wool were king. Those commodities were in demand around the world and our people were the most efficient and productive in those industries. It is sobering to think that the Australian dollar was then worth about $US2.45. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have slipped steadily down the economic ladder ever since then. So our problems in managing the economy are not just recent ones; though it is now well understood that the economy has not been well managed in recent years and the recession `that we had to have' has been deeper and longer than otherwise would have been imposed on us by the world economy. However, looking behind the recent events and going back to last century, we have suffered a more serious and deep-seated problem. We have failed to keep up with the rest of the world in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exceptions to this trend have been our miners and farmers, who are world leaders and have remained world leaders in efficiency and productivity for the past 100 years or so. It is they who have provided us with the external earnings for the rest of us to live comfortably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What went wrong? Essentially, politicians seduced the electorate of the day into thinking that we could pander to various interest groups. The first major interest group to succeed was the protection lobby out of Melbourne, which was led by Alfred Deakin and encouraged and supported last century by David Syme, the founder of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>. The protection lobby was very successful in inculcating an inward looking attitude within a high proportion of Australians so that many believed that they did not have to be internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then came arbitration earlier this century, where the market for labour was severely restricted. These restrictions were effective because of the protective tariff erected around business to keep the rest of the world out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent years we have seen the environment movement receive special attention to the long term detriment of our economy, as characterised by the Wesley Vale and Coronation Hill decisions. Mind you, the environment movement has not been all bad</PARA>
<PARA>for us. It has successfully widened our undestanding of the need for environmental consciousness, but unfortunately the extremists of the movement have been successful in creating unnecessary concern about particular issues, and the political decisions which have arisen have done great harm to our economy and the investment climate. This has applied particularly to my state of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent days, we have had the uncertainty over property rights arising from the Mabo High Court decision. Already our investment climate, particularly for our largest export earners, the miners, has been deleteriously affected. This uncertainty must be removed urgently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our economic decline in the world has been a long term problem. In recent years we have been well and truly passed by Japan and Italy, caught by Hong Kong and almost caught by Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even 10 years ago, Singapore and Hong Kong were places where Australians&mdash;those fortunate enough to be able to travel&mdash;loved to shop, due to the excellent value; that is no longer the case.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a sobering thought that an Australian working as bellboy in Singapore earns more in that job than he would here in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have run an inward looking economy for many decades supported by the earnings of our miners and farmers, and today we continue to slip down the ladder of international competitiveness and we are now ranked about 16th in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does this matter? I am strongly of the view that it does matter&mdash;not for ourselves but for our children and their children. We need to provide for our children and our grandchildren the opportunity of enjoying prosperity and economic growth, so that they have options available to them to devote what they wish to leisure, to the arts and to the environment, to those less well off in the world. Prosperity delivers options to people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, we have started down the track of reversing the inward looking attitude. Freeing up the exchange rate and the finance markets were the first steps. Since then tariffs have been reduced, and thank goodness there is largely a bipartisan commitment to tariff reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At long last Australians are being forced to face up to being more efficient and being internationally competitive. In some industries there have been tremendous changes in productivity since the exchange rate was freed up. In others it is taking a long time for the international market to force its pressures. But I note that even in some of the professions, such as law, they are starting to feel the chill winds of competition, and not before time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to future prosperity is investment. We will not get sustained economic growth without much higher levels of investment. Last financial year investment in plant and equipment was only 5.9 per cent of our GDP&mdash;the lowest level since World War II. In times of prosperity, in the 1960s and 1970s and some of the years in the 1980s, investment in plant and equipment was running at 8 to 10 per cent of GDP. So we have a long way to go in order to get our economy running smoothly again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians' savings&mdash;or foreigners' savings for that matter&mdash;do not have to be invested in Australia. The investment market is truly an international market, and for the private sector savings can be very readily invested offshore, and this is in fact happening. In recent months many Australian companies have announced investments offshore and warned of the unattractiveness of investment here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment needs encouragement. Investors need to have confidence that they can make a fair return on an investment. At present in Australia, one would have to conclude that investors are on strike. What do we do about this situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers are well known and have been recommended in many reports going back over several years. Well known examples include the Hughes report, the earlier Garnaut report, various reports from the Australian Manufacturing Council, Business Council reports, the recent Fitzgerald report, and even Fred Argy's report for CEDA which was released only two weeks ago. In the words of Gerry Van Wyngen in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the formula is as simple and as harsh as it has always been. We have to be able to provide goods and services at competitive rates and quality. That requires elimination of monopolies by government, business or union. No special privileges and sound work practices across the board.</PARA>
<PARA>Given that we have made the correct decisions with regard to the exchange rate, the finance markets and for tariffs and that we have commenced the process of privatising government businesses, what should we do next?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, all the markets that now need to be freed up are difficult and it will take some time to see the results. The labour market is by far the most important but so also are our transport markets&mdash;for road, rail, shipping, wharves&mdash;as well as electricity and telecommunications markets. Some progress has been made in these markets. To show that competition does work, we have all witnessed the beneficial effects of increased competition in the domestic airline industry in recent times. Whilst progress has been made, much more can be and must be done to achieve best international practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote one small shipping example. A Tasmanian company recently replaced its ship to transport a bulk commodity around the Australian waterfront. The older ship which is being replaced is 17 years old and it was originally designed for a crew of seven. When it was introduced 17 years ago, the company tried to arrange for a crew of 12, which is equivalent to what a sister ship in New Zealand had achieved. Unfortunately it failed and it ended up with a crew of 23. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new ship which has just replaced it&mdash;sure, it has much greater capacity&mdash;is in fact being crewed by 22. The old ship is being sold to Europe where, without any alteration whatsoever, it will be crewed by nine. The new ship should have had a similar sized crew. This would have improved the return on the investment made by that company. Certainly, it would have hastened the time when it would look to making further investments. And we wonder why we have not seen much economic growth and why investment has stalled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the parliament with a business background, mostly in manufacturing industry. For nine years, I was chief executive of one of Australia's few internationally competitive manufacturers&mdash;Australian Newsprint Mills Ltd. In more recent years I have been an independent director of several corporations, including four years as chairman of the Hydro Electric Commission until the election was called early this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being responsible for managing a manufacturing company is a good position from which to observe and understand the Australian economy, particularly if the business is internationally competitive with no tariff protection. This latter point means that we have to look outwardly at the rest of the world and you measure your team's performance by judging against the best companies elsewhere in the world. The process is continuous; it never stops. I therefore share the concerns of the miners and the farmers and others who are internationally competitive here for the way our economy is managed. We welcome the move to free up the economy and to change attitudes so that all Australians realise that we do have to be outward looking and internationally competitive in everything we do if our economy is not to slip further behind in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I must be one of the few people in this parliament who has had the privilege of leading a team to initiate, to build and to operate a new factory in Australia. It happened at Albury about 15 years ago. I do understand the investment process and the attitudes of shareholders regarding investment. Again, the message for government is to speed up the micro-economic reform if we want investment, and we do need investment for economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to illustrate the links between investment and micro-economic reform, let me indulge a little by telling honourable senators of one experience I was involved in. Having built a new world competitive newsprint mill at Albury, which started up in 1981, I found that the New South Wales government of the day doubled the price of electricity in the following 12 months. Electricity is the largest cost input in the process of making that grade of paper. For a factory with a turnover of about $100 million, to have its electricity bill go up by $12 million in one year was a hell of a shock. It forced the plant into substantial losses for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there had been a free market for electricity, as is currently proposed by the National Grid Council, it is very likely that the plant would have been able to negotiate alternative supplies of electricity at cheaper rates. If this had happened, I am very confident that the plant would have doubled in size by now but, of course, it has not. So there was a potential capital investment of $400 million or so which was lost as a result of the unintended consequences of a state government action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ironically, after this sobering experience as a major electricity customer, I later became chairman of the Tasmanian Electricity Utility where I am proud to say the management team has, in recent years, changed the direction of the organisation and improved efficiency very substantially, basically in preparation for the eventual competitive market. Such changes are difficult and very time consuming but they can be done. To illustrate the magnitude of the changes at the Hydro-Electric Commission, it had about 4,000 employees when I joined it four years ago and it will be down to approximately 2,000 by the end of this year, a process carried out without any major fuss or trauma. I should explain that about half of that change resulted from stopping further hydro capacity expansions and the other half from efficiency changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite these figures because they illustrate what is being done and what can be done in both private and government businesses. I am certain that major efficiency gains can also be made within the budget sector of government. Such major changes must be made if we are to reduce the taxation burden on individuals and business so that people are encouraged to work harder, to save and to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been personally involved in the transformation of two major businesses to make them more market oriented and efficient, I know that all the people who have been involved in such restructuring are in fact very, very proud of their achievements. So I am very confident that all Australians can and will respond to the challenge if they are given the opportunity. In March this year, Professor Helen Hughes wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if government is determined to achieve it, a sustained growth rate of 7% in our economy is feasible.</PARA>
<PARA>Two weeks ago in the CEDA report, Fred Argy said we should aim for a growth rate of about 5 per cent. Such targets for the future are achievable. All Australians will respond if given the chance. Let us get on with the task of freeing up the various markets in our economy in order to give our children a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a senator I intend to concentrate on the economy and the business of government. With regard to the economy, I wish to influence all the so-called micro-economic reform issues which affect business and hence investment. When one enters a new business, the first thing one has to do is to understand the money flows&mdash;where the income is coming from and where the expenditure is going. I therefore hope to get on top of the money flows for the federal government and also the financial relationship between it and the states. I think this is very important for all the states, particularly for smaller states such as Tasmania. </PARA>

My great-grandfather was born in New South Wales and became a bullock teamster, travelling regularly between Bathurst and Bourke.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1962, 12 months married and with a brand new baby, my wife, who is also here today, and I travelled to Mitchell-Injune Methodist circuit where I began as a lay pastor in my first appointment. At that time I had all the answers and all the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> texts to prove it. I quickly learned that not only did I not have all the answers, but there were many questions I had not even thought about. So began a journey which has brought me via many sidetracks and dry gullies to this place. Just as I have learned over the years that I do not have all the answers, so I expect to learn here that no party and no individual parliamentarian has all the answers either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is one observation I bring with me, and it has to do with the 30 years that I have spent travelling throughout Queensland. Those 30 years have enabled me to observe the steady decline in population, the impoverishment of many rural families and the awful neglect of the bush by successive governments of every complexion. Again, I may not have many answers, but I am determined that some of their story will be recorded here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during my time at Mitchell and later at Cloncurry that I first met in any real way Aboriginal Australians. That meeting changed my life and has shaped me ever since. The Aborigines in Mitchell lived in a fringe camp about three kilometres from the main township and on the other side of the Maranoa River. They called their camp the Yumba. It was reached through a series of dirt tracks, through coarse grass and scrub, and often there were more potholes than track. For much of the time, especially in winter, the track was obscured by clouds of dust which hung over the camp. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the camp were two rows of two-roomed timber cottages which were unpainted and unlined. They had been built by the government well before the Second World War in the hope, no doubt, that it would be Aborigines out of sight and out of mind. There were other buildings of bush timber, beaten out flat metal drums and corrugated iron. Windows and doorways were covered with hessian corn sacks. The smell of carbide hung over the camp as the lamps were used to produce the only light which the people had at night. There was no electricity supply to the camp&mdash;neither was there any telephone, public transport, garbage collection, nightsoil collection or water supply. Despite these conditions, the people of the Yumba had their own way of life which they valued highly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1968 the Yumba was bulldozed and some Aboriginal families moved into the main township. Mitchell had been sewered and the Yumba was now regarded as a health hazard by the white community. In 1991 I was invited back to the Yumba to help celebrate its handing back to the Aboriginal people. The old school had been relocated for use as an education and cultural centre. Of course, electricity and water are now laid on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I arrived in Mitchell and the Yumba my contact with Aborigines had been minimal. I carried with me all the usual stereotypes; in other words, I was no different from most Australians. On top of this, in religious terms I was a conservative evangelical. This meant that I had a very individualistic view of faith and a simplistic understanding of human nature: all humans are sinners, sin is the cause of all the misery in the world, all of us are individually responsible for our own situation&mdash;therefore, if our situation is worse than that of other people, we must be the worst of sinners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I soon discovered that my simplistic theology and world view did not fit. Life and the human condition were far more complex than I had ever imagined. In the example of the people of the Yumba, sin was certainly part of the equation but I was forced to ask, `Whose sin?'. I began to discover that beyond individual responsibility there is a collective dynamic at work which so often limits the possibilities for any oppressed group&mdash;be they Aborigines, farmers or the unemployed&mdash;and that to apply notions of individual responsibility alone is meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was this discovery which changed the direction of my life and the course of my thinking. I re-read the biblical record from the perspective of those pushed to the edges of life. I came to understand that individual salvation is only part of the story, and not even the major part. There is a concern within the scriptures for humanity as a totality which goes beyond viewing humanity as the sum of each individual, and beyond humanity a concern for the earth and every living thing on the earth. This is a rethink which has convinced me of the fundamental nature of the demand for social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the cultural factors which militates against an agenda for social justice is the overemphasis within western society upon individualism. I am sorry if that upsets some members of this chamber. It is this emphasis which reinforces the `greed is good' mentality of much of our economic thinking. It denigrates any option for collective responsibility as closet Marxism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to argue that the notion of collective responsibility has a much older ancestry than Marxism. It is a fundamental factor in the prophetic stream of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures. I should add that the prophetic element in the scriptures is not so much about predicting the future as it is about speaking justice with those at the bottom of the heap in contemporary society. Although I warn about an overemphasis on individualism, I want to say that collective justice or injustice is certainly personal as well as collective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spent a good part of the last two weeks driving between different centres in south western Queensland. I visited Toowoomba, Roma, Injune, Warwick, Dalby and St George. I have spoken and listened carefully to farmers, Lifeline counsellors, clergy and drought relief coordinators. Everywhere the story is the same. Western people will cope with drought and other natural disasters, but they cannot fight against political, banking and financial systems which seem to be bent on destroying rural industry and rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to record here some of the examples of collective injustice and personal tragedy which I have heard. One family in the St George area listened to the advice they had been given for the last 20 years&mdash;get big or get out&mdash;and so they borrowed $100,000 to buy a neighbouring property. Over a period of some years they paid out $300,000 on the debt but found that they still owed thousands of dollars. The bank foreclosed on one property but the family's solicitors refused to hand over the deed of the other property to the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After negotiation, the family were allowed to stay on their property and registered with the CES because they were destitute and hoped to obtain off-the-farm employment to survive and perhaps repay some of the debt. They obtained a jobsearch allowance which was paid into their bank account. The bank immediately confiscated their allowance and left them with nothing. I am told that banks have confiscated children's accounts to pay for parents' debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various parliamentarians, including ministers, have visited western Queensland in the last few months. Promises have been made to farmers about making rural support schemes and social security more accessible. Unfortunately, the bureaucratic blocks continue to frustrate. Despite assurances, the banks are not backing off, either. Foreclosures and repossessions occur daily. This is incredibly short-sighted. What is the point of closing down farm production, having a fire sale and then not recovering the debt anyway? I am told that one property west of Charleville was bought a few years ago for $750,000. It was recently put up for auction but passed in; the highest bid was $85,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to my main point: so often political decisions these days are justified by using economic argument. Workers are made redundant, railway lines are ripped up and government services are curtailed, especially in rural communities&mdash;all done in the name of economic efficiency. I for one could not accept that economics ought to be the basic determinant in such decisions. These are first of all political decisions. Governments should admit that they have no real commitment to the bush, instead of using economic argument as a cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe economics ought to be the servant of the political process, not its master. Although economic rationalism is getting bad press these days, this has not affected it as the absolute driving force behind government decision making at both state and federal levels. However, I think it is giving the theory too much credibility to call it rational. I prefer the term `economic ramboism'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I am accused of being a wet, illiterate economic philistine, I want to quote two economic professors from the University of Queensland, Rod Jensen and John Foster. They spoke at the annual grain growers conference in central Queensland a few weeks ago. They are far more blunt than I am. They refer to the current crop of Treasury bureaucrats as `market fundamentalists'. Here is part of what they said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very large number of Australian economists, who do not seek television exposure or regular press coverage of their views, look upon political debates concerning economic policy, cast in such a superficial and misleading language, as bordering on the absurd. However, amusement has given way to growing disquiet in the community of economists, as actual policies have emerged from such superficial debates, receiving support only from a small minority of economists which we like to call `market fundamentalists', who uphold a literal and unquestioning belief in the efficacy of markets (both domestic and international).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is by no means a foregone conclusion that the world, or even our potential trading partners, will follow our example of zero tariffs, and any assumption of this type can only be considered as naive in the extreme. There may be a warm feeling of virtue in being one of a few players in the game following the rules. However, this warm feeling will not be shared by those whose unemployment has been exported in the pursuit of an impossible dream based on questionable theoretical grounds. Lest the non-economists demur on theoretical grounds, we must make it quite clear that even economic theory does not support the extremes of the fundamentalist view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me be clear: I am not advocating economic irresponsibility. Governments need to be efficient but efficiency can never be the only starting point for political decision making. The starting point has to be people and the places where they live. We do not represent economic theory in parliament, we represent people. Economic ramboism is the prevailing theory of economics whose god is efficiency and whose legacy is worldwide poverty and unemployment. This theory views people as expendable and makes enemies of those who end up on the debit side of its balance sheet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the risk of too many analogies, I give you one more: our economic and banking systems are meant to be the lubricant to keep the machinery of production moving smoothly. Economic ramboism has stolen the vehicle, it is careering down the street out of control and, I can tell you, it is no joy-ride. The analogy can be taken a little further: economic theory and the financial system are the means to achieve desired social and political ends. It is true that such ends cannot be achieved without a proper and efficient financial mechanism. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe, however, that too often economic theory has become the goal&mdash;an end in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It works like this: an important and desirable social goal in this nation is that our children find their way to school. One of the means used in our country is the school bus. One can imagine economic theorists looking at the school bus and being horrified at the amount of time it takes to get from point A to point B. Their solution may be that a quicker and far more efficient method would be to replace the bus with a formula 1 racing car. They may even conduct tests to prove the theory to be correct in economic terms and that delivery time can be cut in half. There is only one problem, of course: the racing car does not carry any children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic theory must again become a servant to enable Australians to achieve the worthwhile social, political and commercial goals they desire.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that I state what my goals are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the debate about a republic has made many Australians examine again what it is that makes a nation, and there are many ideas about how we define ourselves. Some would argue that it is our constitution or our flag or the monarchy which makes us what we are. Others would argue that courage in battle, sporting prowess or intellectual achievement are the marks of a great nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these are important symbols for me. But, because of my Jewish-Christian roots, I believe the critical attribute which truly measures our nation's worth is the way we treat those pushed to the edges of life, those at the bottom of the heap.
