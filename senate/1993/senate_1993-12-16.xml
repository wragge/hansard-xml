<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statements read as follows:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Application of the ACT Payroll Tax Act 1987 to the University of Canberra</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Mal Colston, the Chairman of the Committee, is the person appointed to the Council of the Australian National University (ANU) by the Governor-General on the nomination of the Prime Minister under s.10(1)(g) of the Australian National University Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National University Act provides for the general establishment and operation of the ANU. Among other things that Act provides that the ANU is, subject to one express exception, not subject to taxation under the laws of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory. That exception is s.48(2), which provides that the ANU is subject to payroll tax under the law of a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of his duties as a member of the Council of the ANU, Senator Colston was informed that the University of Canberra also paid payroll tax to the Australian Capital Territory government, apparently under some instrument of delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Colston then asked the Legal Adviser to the Committee, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, about the legislative basis upon which the University of Canberra paid this tax. Professor Whalan reported that there appeared to be no legislative requirement for the tax to be paid. The Legal Adviser added, however, that he was somewhat hesitant about his opinion, because it seemed unusual that a major institution was paying considerable amounts in tax with no legal obligation to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Canberra was the effective successor to the Canberra College of Advanced Education, established under the Canberra College of Advanced Education Act 1967. There was no doubt that the Canberra CAE was required to pay payroll tax. A series of Regulations, made under an express provision of the parent Act, provided for such liability, the latest being the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Canberra College of Advanced Education (Liability to Taxation) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1989 No. 90.</EMPHASIS> The effect of those regulations was that the CAE was liable to taxation under the Pay-roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act 1971 and the Payroll Tax Ordinance 1987 of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Canberra was then established under the University of Canberra Act 1989, which commenced on 1 January 1990. That Act repealed the Canberra College of Advanced Education Act. Section 38 of the new Act established the liability to taxation of the University of Canberra. That section provided:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No regulations had been made providing that section 38 did not apply in relation to taxation under a law imposing ACT payroll tax. The question, therefore, was whether any other provision of the University of Canberra Act expressly required payment of the tax, provided the power to require such payment, or provided that the liability of the CAE to pay payroll tax continued as an obligation of the University. Professor Whalan could find no such provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Canberra Act provided for the Council to make Statutes on a wide range of matters. The Statutes appeared to be legislative and were required to be approved by the Governor-General, notified in the Gazette and tabled in both Houses of Parliament. Rules and orders could be made under the Statutes. There was nothing, however, to indicate that a Statute could override the plain words of a section of the Act. In any event, no such Statutes had been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The University of Canberra Act also provided extensive consequential and transitional provisions to ensure a smooth transition from the old CAE to the new University. Thus, the University was deemed to be the successor in law of the CAE, the assets and liabilities of the CAE became those of the University, and CAE instruments (expressly defined to include legislative instruments) and Statutes continued to have effect. Here also, however, there was nothing to indicate either that payroll liability continued or that power existed under these provisions to impose such liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Colston therefore wrote to the University of Canberra and to the Commonwealth Auditor-General, whom the University of Canberra Act requires to audit the financial statements of the University. The replies which he received confirmed that there was no requirement for the University to pay payroll tax under the ACT Act. The replies also indicated that either the Act would be amended or regulations made to impose such liability.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">University of Canberra Regulations, Statutory Rules 1993 No.244</EMPHASIS>, were then made on 15 September 1993. The Regulations were quite short, providing that section 38 of the Act did not apply in relation to taxation under the Payroll Tax Act 1987 of the Australian Capital Territory. The regulations were taken to have commenced retrospectively to 1 January 1990, which was the date of commencement of the University of Canberra Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement for the Regulations set out the background to their making. It advised that it had been intended that the University would be liable to pay ACT payroll tax. Recent legal advice had, however, indicated that in the absence of specific regulations under subsection 38 (3) of the University of Canberra Act, the University was not liable to the payment of this tax. The Explanatory Statement further advised that the purpose of the Regulation was to make the University liable to the payment of payroll tax under the ACT Payroll Tax Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement then properly discussed the legal effect of the retrospective commencement of the Regulations. Under s.48 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 regulations are void if the rights of a person, other than the Commonwealth or an authority of the Commonwealth, would be prejudiced or liabilities imposed upon them before the date of gazettal of the regulations. Therefore, unless the University was an authority of the Commonwealth, the Regulations would be void. The Explanatory Statement then explained that the Office of General Counsel, Attorney-General's Department, had advised that the University was created as an instrument of government. Although the University was granted considerable autonomy in carrying out its functions, the Commonwealth retained significant powers in relation to those functions. Its purpose in providing higher education, in the opinion of the Office of General Counsel, may rightly be viewed as governmental and the University as an authority of the Commonwealth. The retrospective commencement of the Regulations was not, therefore, in contravention of s.48 (2) of the Acts Interpretation Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was surprised at this advice that the University of Canberra was created as an instrument of government and was an authority of the Commonwealth. It therefore wrote to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Hon Kim Beazley MP, asking for a copy of the Office of General Counsel's advice and of the advice that before the Regulations were made the University was not liable to pay ACT payroll tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister promptly arranged for the Committee to receive the advisings, which accorded with the advice in the Explanatory Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not dispute the advice from Office of General Counsel. Rather, it draws this matter to the attention of the Senate as an interesting by-way of Commonwealth public administration. The Committee spends a great deal of its time looking at provisions of delegated legislation which should never have been made. It is unusual for it to encounter a case where delegated legislation should have been made but was not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Standard of Proof in Australian Federal Police Disciplinary Proceedings</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 23 June 1992 Senator Giles, then Chair of the Committee, reported to the Senate on its scrutiny of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1992 No.58</EMPHASIS>. Senator Giles reported that the Regulations raised issues of such interest and concern that the Committee considered that a detailed statement should be made. The purpose of this present statement is to inform the Senate of recent developments in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substantive issue which concerned the Committee about these Regulations was a provision that the standard of proof required before the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal is proof beyond reasonable doubt. This standard of proof was that required in criminal proceedings, rather than the lesser civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities. The Committee asked the Minister why the higher standard of proof was adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The then Minister for Justice, Senator the Hon Michael Tate, advised that the purpose of the Regulations was to validate the existing standard of proof, not to implement a new policy decision. The reason for the criminal standard of proof was that penalties imposed following disciplinary proceedings could have practical consequences as severe as any criminal sentence short of imprisonment. In addition, many breaches of discipline could also be crimes. This was significant because of the confrontational nature of much police contact with the public. Also, the prospect of a lower standard of proof would discourage pursuit of criminal investigation of those police who breached discipline. Finally, the lower standard could harm an AFP member in ambiguous circumstances and be a means for dishonest persons to raise doubts about police evidence or avenge themselves on an AFP member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considered that this matter was so important that it should be briefed by the then Commonwealth Ombudsman, Mr Alan Cameron, and by other senior officials of his office. The Ombudsmen advised that the Civil standard was a floating standard, which varied according to the degree of seriousness of the charge. On the other hand, the criminal standard encouraged undue caution when disciplinary proceedings are being considered. The criminal standard may be defensible when a member's career was at stake, but the civil standard was more suitable for less serious offences. Most State police forces now had the civil standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore had to balance two compelling but conflicting arguments. On the one hand, the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt gave a high level of protection to individual AFP members while providing lesser protection to members of the public. On the other hand, the civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities gave lesser protection to AFP members but greater protection for the broader public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After considerable discussion the Committee adopted its usual course where there are two or more conflicting sets of rights to be protected, and did not seek amendment of the relevant delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter then rested for more than a year, with no further developments coming to the attention of the Committee. The Committee then received for scrutiny two sets of regulations which overturned the previous policy about the standard of proof in AFP disciplinary procedures expressly affirmed by regulation eighteen months previously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.307</EMPHASIS>, made on 17 November 1993, are very short. The only substantive provision is two lines long, amending the principal Regulations by omitting "beyond reasonable doubt" from the regulations dealing with the standard of proof in AFP disciplinary proceedings and substituting "on the balance of probabilities". Because the Regulations do not expressly provide for a date of commencement, they commenced on gazettal, in this case 25 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advised that the purpose of the Regulations was to replace the existing criminal standard of proof which is applied in disciplinary proceedings before the Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal with the civil standard of proof. The Explanatory Statement further advised that the level of proof required in proceedings under the new standard would not be significantly different as a result of this change where the breach of discipline is serious. This is because the test provides for a higher standard of proof depending on the seriousness of the issue and the gravity of consequences following from an adverse finding of the Tribunal. The new Regulations ensure, advises the Explanatory Statement, that the AFP internal disciplinary scheme is an effective personal management tool and is consistent with the standard of proof required in most other Australian police forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1993 No.306</EMPHASIS>, also made on 17 November 1993, among other things omit "beyond reasonable doubt" from a regulation dealing with hearings before the Commissioner and substitute "on the balance of probabilities". Because the Regulations do not provide for a date of commencement, they commenced on gazettal, which was 25 November 1993. The relevant parts of the Explanatory Statement for these Regulations were identical with those for the corresponding amendments of the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Regulations.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that the two sets of Regulations overturned the previous policy on the standard of proof, but decided not to write to the Minister. From its previous investigation the Committee was aware of the relevant issues and accepted that reasonable people of good will could differ on how to address these issues. Accordingly, it accepted the executive prerogative to change the law in this way, thereby affecting the existing balance of personal rights and safeguards. Nevertheless, this does not mean that Members of the Committee do not hold definite views on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This case illustrates the flexibility of executive law making and how a major change of policy may be implemented by delegated legislation. It also illustrates the difficult task of balancing the rights of different groups, where to provide effective safeguards for one may result in the dilution of existing safeguards for another. As noted previously the Committee is not assertive is such cases, seeking rather to inform itself of the issues and to be aware of the dilemma. This is particularly so, as in the present case, where Members of the Committee are as likely to hold different views on the matter as any other representative Australian group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances Statement on work of Committee during Budget Sittings 1993</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overview</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee maintained its non-partisan scrutiny of the continuing large number of disallowable instruments of delegated legislation tabled in the Senate. In the course of the sittings the Committee scrutinised 977 such instruments. Only 252 of these were in the Statutory Rules series, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series. This is a trend which has been evident for some years. The other 725 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure compliance with its four principles, which cover all aspects of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. If the Committee detects any breach of these principles it writes to the Minister or other law maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives a notice of motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concerns raised by the Committee are described below under each of the four principles which constitute its terms of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is interpreted broadly by the Committee. Together with the Committee's fourth principle, it covers not only technical validity, but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical validity, however, is an important aspect of the Committee's work. During the sittings some instruments were void because they purported to subdelegate the legislative power granted by the parent Act. Several other instruments purported to commence before commencement of relevant amendments of the parent Act. One instrument was made in reliance on a Bill, whereas delegated legislation may only be made under express provisions of an Act. Another instrument obviously intended to effect the provisions of an attached appendix and this intention was confirmed by the Explanatory Statement. The instrument itself, however, did not mention the appendix. One instrument provided for a fee higher than the maximum authorised by the parent Act. Several instruments with retrospective effect operated to affect rights prejudicially and were therefore void. Others were not themselves invalid but action under them was invalid. For example, payments were made in reliance on instruments with no commencement date and which had not been gazetted. Other instruments were not tabled within fifteen sitting days of making and thereby ceased to have effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other instruments may have been valid but were of great concern to the Committee. One series of instruments which are not disallowable may legally amend or even repeal instruments which are disallowable. Another series of instruments which are not subject to tabling or disallowance included offence provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drafting of delegated legislation should be of a quality not less than that of Acts. A number of instruments included wrong references to other legislation and provisions. One instrument was made under an Act which did not exist. Other instruments referred to "he" and "him", whereas contemporary drafting practice would refer to "he or she" and "him or her". One instrument referred to review of a decision, but neither the parent Act, the principal instrument nor the amendment provided for review. Other instruments provided for mandatory requirements in an unclear way. Others included vague and uncertain expressions such as "honest and efficient provider". One principal instrument was expressed to be made under two Acts while an amendment was expressed to be made under one Act. The Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised that it was made under two provisions of an Act but the making words of the instrument itself cited only one provision. Another instrument used only the scientific expression cairina muschata, which in fact is a muscovy duck. An instrument providing for the design of a proof gold coin omitted any reference to Australia. Numbers of instruments were not provided with numbering or citation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full and detailed explanatory material should accompany every instrument of delegated legislation. Several instruments had no Explanatory Statement. Several Explanatory Statements lacked attachments to which they made reference. The Explanatory Statements for others did not advise of the basis upon which fees and charges were levied or increased, even where fees were increased up to seven times or where the parent Act provided that the fees must not amount to taxation. One instrument included Notes which were inconsistent. Some instruments made to implement an undertaking given to the Committee did not acknowledge this in the Explanatory Statement. Other instruments which commenced on gazettal did not indicate the date of gazettal. In one case the wrong date of gazettal was given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, the Explanatory Statement should explain any unusual aspect of an instrument. For instance, in certain countries the vehicle allowance paid to Australian officials was greater for vehicles with less than 1,500 c.c. engine capacity than it was for those with a larger engine capacity; a sunset clause was extended for twelve months; and ten instruments made in 1993 included citations for 1990, 1991 and 1992. No explanation was given for any of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was pleased to note, however, that some instruments were particularly well presented. One included a special explanation because it was the first instrument in the series to come before the present Parliament. Another had helpful notes for users and colour coding of provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any power to delegate in delegated legislation should be narrow and specific. As usual, several instruments provided for the Minister or other law maker to delegate his or her powers to any person at all. Also, several instruments similarly provided for the appointment of authorised persons, without proper restrictions on who could be appointed. In one of these cases, authorised persons could exercise important powers in relation to offence provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle in the broadest way, to include every aspect of personal rights. During the sittings the Committee detected the following possible defects in delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions of delegated legislation should not operate harshly or unfairly. One instrument required persons to give an undertaking to indemnify a statutory authority to what appeared to be an unreasonable level. Another required persons in certain circumstances to act as a guarantor for another's food, clothing, accommodation, household goods, obtaining employment and receiving English language lessons. Another imposed what may have been harsh conditions on the grant of a permit. Another increased fees by what may have been an unreasonable degree. One instrument created an offence with vicarious liability, which the Committee regards as always requiring detailed explanation and justification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Procedural requirements in delegated legislation should be as reasonable as possible. In the case of a number of instruments providing for ATSIC elections, the Committee was concerned that procedural safeguards should not be less than those for elections for the Australian Parliament. Another instrument gazetted on 23 June provided detailed procedures for an annual general meeting required to be held before 30 June in that year. It was impossible to comply with some of these procedures. Another instrument provided for a retirement benefit for a public servant, but only if that officer retired on the same day as the instrument was made. That instrument appeared to be made in haste, as the name of the officer was spelt in two different ways. It is not known whether the instrument was gazetted on the day on which it was made. Another instrument provided that a person must state not only if he or she had been convicted of an offence, but also whether he or she was merely subject to proceedings. Conviction was defined as including a person discharged without conviction or found not guilty but had the charge taken into account when sentence was passed for another offence. Another instrument provided for important safeguards for persons selected for mandatory drug testing to be permissive rather than mandatory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated legislation must provide for people to be notified of their rights. One instrument provided that if a person elected to pay an administrative penalty for an offence, then all liability was discharged, no further action may be taken and the person is not regarded as having been convicted of any offence. These were important safeguards, but the instrument did not require them to be communicated to the offender. Another instrument notified people only of some of their rights. Also, the notification was in technical legalistical terms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee protects personal privacy . The Explanatory Statement for one instrument advised that it accorded with the Privacy Principles. The importance of its subject matter, however, indicated that this was a case where the Privacy Commissioner should have been consulted. The Committee also guards against discrimination based on personal circumstances. One amending instrument expressly excluded de facto spouses, who were expressly included by the principal instrument. Another instrument expressly excluded divorced or separated females from a definition of unmarried employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (c)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependant on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated legislation often provides for Ministers and other public officials to exercise discretions. Such discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit the exercise of the discretion, and provide for appropriate review of the merits of a decision to an external, independent tribunal, which would normally be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement for one instrument advised that a discretion was subject to external review under the parent Act but did not give the same assurance in respect of other equally important discretions which appeared also to be subject to review under the same provision. Another instrument providing for discretions was expressed to come into effect before amendments of the parent Act providing for AAT review. Another provided for discretions in a type of instrument which had not previously included such provisions and in respect of which they appeared unsuitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Discretions should be limited by objective criteria. One instrument included as a criterion "any other information which the Minister believes is relevant" and another "any other matters that the Board considers relevant". Other subjective expressions in provisions dealing with discretions included "definite unmet public need" and "the activity is of national importance". Other provisions included what were actually discretions but with no indication of this fact or of the person who was to exercise the discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some instruments which did not provide for merits review of discretion where it may have been appropriate to do so included the power to waive a fee, to revoke or suspend permits, to extend retiring age from 60 to 65, to decide who is a child and to make decisions affecting personal superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a stronger case for merits review where a decision maker may delegate his or her powers to others. The Committee takes into account the power to delegate when considering whether review provisions are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (d)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raises this principle less often than its other principles. It is a principle, however, which goes to the heart of parliamentary propriety and complements the first principle of the Committee, that an instrument should be in accordance with the statute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ninety-Third Report of the Committee, a Report on scrutiny by the Committee of regulations imposing United Nations sanctions, discussed whether such sanctions, including imports and exports, air navigation, foreign exchange and migration, were more suitable for parliamentary debate and enactment. This Report was favourably mentioned in both the second reading speech and the Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill for the eventual Charter of the United Nations Amendment Act 1993, which expressly provided for such sanctions to be made by regulation. Regulations under provisions inserted by that Act were tabled during the sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other developments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to its main task of scrutinising legislation, the Committee was active in other ways during the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 September 1993 Senator Loosley resigned as Chairman and Senator Colston was elected as Chairman. Senator Loosley had been Chairman since 10 September 1992 and the Committee appreciated his leadership. Senator Colston was a former Chairman of the Committee from 14 May 1990 to 18 October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 18 August 1993, the Deputy Chairman, Senator Bishop, and Senator Patterson resigned from the Committee. They were replaced by Senators Gibson and Minchin, appointed to the Committee on 18 August 1993. On 30 September 1993, the Chairman appointed Senator O'Chee as Deputy Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee tabled two Reports during the sittings, the Ninety-Sixth Report, the Annual Report for 1992-93; and the Ninety-Seventh Report, a report on a case study of delegated legislation and the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chairman, on behalf of the Committee, made special statements to the Senate on delegated legislation under the University of Canberra Act 1989, and on the standard of proof in Australian Federal Police disciplinary proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee continued its practice of meeting with others concerned about delegated legislation. These sittings it met with Ms Jean Baker, head of the Office of Legislative Drafting (for the second time this year), with the Director of Research of the Administrative Review Council, with an official of the Australian Sports Drug Agency and an official of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. The Secretary met with officials of the Department of Employment, Education and Training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Committee and the Legal Adviser attended the Fourth Australian and Pacific Conference on Delegated Legislation held in the Victorian Parliament House in July. The then Chairman, Senator Loosley, presented a paper and Senator Colston presented a report and chaired a session. Senator Colston was also invited to chair the closing session dealing with resolutions and to close the Conference. This was an honour not only for the Committee, but also for the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was briefed and consulted on the Cabinet and budgetary processes for implementing the major report of the Administrative Review Council on rule making by Commonwealth agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee hosted a visit by the Victorian Scrutiny of Acts and Regulations Committee. The secretariat hosted a visit by the Secretary of the South Australian Legislative Review Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 December the Chairman hosted the Committee's biennial dinner with the Administrative Review Council and others, attended by 30 people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would like to record its appreciation of the sterling work of its independent Legal Adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful for the support which it has received from all Senators during the past sittings.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CHEMICAL WEAPONS (PROHIBITION) BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Bill 1993 will give effect to Australia's obligations as a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and will provide a legislative basis for its national implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia signed the Convention when it opened for signature on 13 January this year and will ratify the Convention after enactment of this legislation. The Convention will enter into force 180 days after the 65th ratification, but not before 13 January 1995. Although only 4 of the 154 signatories have yet ratified the Convention, many others are preparing for ratification and implementation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was instrumental in accelerating the final negotiations and bringing negotiations on the Convention to a successful conclusion last year. That event marked a significant turning point in international efforts to curb proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. For the first time the global community agreed to ban completely a whole category of weapons of mass destruction, require the destruction of all existing stocks of chemical weapons and their production facilities, and provide an effective mechanism to verify compliance with the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention is the most intrusive global instrument yet developed through the United Nations system, not only requiring States Parties to make annual declarations on production and use of certain chemicals but also to subject facilities which produce or use those chemicals above specified thresholds to routine inspections by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the CWC's permanent body in The Hague. Any State Party also has the right to request the Organization to conduct a challenge inspection of any place within the territory of another State Party if it has reason to suspect that the other State Party may not be acting in compliance with the Convention. A State Party has no right to refuse such an inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intrusive nature of the Convention's verification regime is essential for building confidence in the Convention itself. It will provide a means by which allegations or suspicions of non-compliance on the part of a State Party may be clarified.  Where suspicions are not clarified, supplier countries have resorted to denying those engaged in suspicious activities with precursor chemicals and equipment and technology needed to develop a chemical weapons program, even though such goods may be for quite legitimate purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entry into force of the Convention and wide adherence to it will benefit international trade in chemicals and chemical technology. This has been a factor in the strong support given to the Convention by Australian and international chemical industry organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As required by the Convention, this bill, in clause 12, makes it an offence to develop, acquire, stockpile, retain, transfer or use chemical weapons. It will also be an offence for anyone in Australia or the external Territories, or any Australian citizen overseas, to assist, encourage or induce any other person to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chemicals which pose the greatest risk to the Convention are contained in three schedules attached to the Convention. Facilities which produce or use these chemicals above specified thresholds have to be declared to the Organization. The facility operators will also be required under this legislation to provide information for Australia's declarations to the Organization and will be subject to routine inspection by the Organization. Access to facilities for national or international compliance inspection purposes will be effected by consent of the operator or by a warrant issued by a magistrate. Trial inspections held in Australia and overseas have shown that such inspections cause minimal disruption to commercial operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Convention and this legislation contain confidentiality provisions to protect the integrity of information gained during any activity related to the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also covers the Convention's provision for managed access by international inspectors to facilities where there is sensitive chemical technology or other information unrelated to chemical weapons. Managed access does not weaken the inspection process but is an added measure of protection for the confidentiality of commercial or national security interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a permit system for declared facilities producing or using scheduled chemicals. The permit system will be the legal framework to facilitate the collection of information for Australia's annual declarations. The permits will be issued by the Minister and may be renewed, transferred or revoked. Conditions relating to Australia's obligations under the Convention will be attached to the permits. Ministerial decisions relating to permits will be subject to merits review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The permit system will be administered by the Chemical Weapons Convention Office, which will be established as a non-statutory unit within an organisation in the Minister's Portfolio. The Office will engage national inspectors, who will have inspection powers to verify that declared facilities are complying with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other chemical production facilities, which produce unscheduled discrete organic chemicals above specified thresholds, will be required to notify the Chemical Weapons Convention Office at the end of each year of their production levels of those chemicals, for inclusion in Australia's annual declarations. These facilities were included in the Convention's verification regime because they are capable of being used in support of a chemical weapons production program. They will not, however, be subject to international inspection for at least three years after the Convention's entry into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Controls on the import and export of certain chemicals as required by the Convention will be implemented by amendment of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations and the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed national controls contained in this bill to implement the Convention, including its verification regime, are similar to those currently administered by the Australian Safeguards Office under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention underwent a 20 year period of gestation. In the changing world resulting from the end of the Cold War, it is important for the Convention to enter into force as early as possible, and that as many states as possible be encouraged to ratify it before that time. With the introduction of this legislation into the Parliament, Australia will be setting an example for other states, particularly those in our region, to follow. We are also continuing to assist regional states, under the Chemical Weapons Regional Initiative, with their implementation of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides for a range of mainly administrative amendments to be made to the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. These acts form the legislative basis of Australia's national industrial property system, a system which plays an important role in our nation's economic prosperity and growth. Patent and design laws encourage technological advancement and stimulate industrial development. Trade mark laws, which assist in ensuring that the goods and services of one enterprise are distinguishable from those of other enterprises, enable orderly marketing and benefit both producers and consumers alike. The bill also amends sunset clauses in the Industry, Research and Development Act 1986 in line with the government's decision to extend the competitive grants scheme of the Industry Innovation Program until the end of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now briefly like to detail the legislative changes made to these acts by the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1992, the organisation that was known as the Australian Patent, Trade Marks and Designs Offices, became the Australian Industrial Property Organisation (AIPO). Along with the name change came some structural changes. AIPO is a Division of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. The Divisional Head, who holds the non-statutory position of Director-General, has, in addition to his statutory functions as the Commissioner of Patents, Registrar of Trade Marks and Registrar of Designs, the responsibility for the overall administration of AIPO. As part of the structural changes I referred to, greater emphasis is to be placed on the management responsibilities of the Director-General as distinct from the statutory roles of Commissioner of Patents, Registrar of Trade Marks and Registrar of Designs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes relevant changes to the above Acts to enable the statutory functions of the Commissioner of Patents and the Registrar of Designs to be carried out by the head of the Patent and Designs Offices, and the functions of the Registrar of Trade Marks to be carried out by the head of the Trade Marks Office. Other minor administrative changes allow the above statutory office holders to delegate their powers and functions to staff working in the relevant offices. This will help the Director-General to concentrate on the overall financial and general management of AIPO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a signatory to a number of multilateral international conventions dealing with the protection of industrial property. One of these is the multilateral Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. Australia has also entered into a number of bilateral arrangements that impose similar obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The patent, trade marks and designs legislation each make provision in relation to recognising a right of priority for what are called "Convention applications". This means that an application for a patent, trade mark or a design in a "Convention country" will, subject to the fulfilment of certain requirements, be regarded as if it had been filed in Australia on the same day as it was filed in the particular Convention country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 17 August 1993, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the protection of industrial property rights between the Australian Commerce and Industry Office and the Taiwan Bureau of National Standards was signed. Amongst other things, the MOU provides for a mutual right of priority. For AIPO to meet its obligations as an "implementing authority" under the MOU, regulations are required to declare Taiwan to be a Convention country for the purposes of the Patents, Trade Marks and Designs Acts. The regulation making power to provide for this is available in the Patents Act, but not in the Designs or Trade Marks Acts. These latter Acts only provide for regulations to be made declaring Convention countries with a view to the fulfilment of a treaty, or other like instrument between the Commonwealth and another country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An MOU in Australia does not have the status of a treaty. Changes are therefore proposed to the Trade Marks and Designs Acts which will allow for regulations to be made declaring a country to be a Convention country for the purposes of those Acts, as is currently provided for in the Patents Act. These changes will remove the limitation of the declaration being made with a view to fulfilling a treaty or other like instrument between the commonwealth and another country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, changes are proposed to the Designs Act which will provide regulation making power to allow the Registrar of Designs, either on his own motion, or on request, to correct an entry in the Register of Designs for the purposes of correcting a clerical error or obvious mistake. Currently, the only way such an error can be corrected is by the application of the registered owner of the design to the Federal Court or a State Supreme Court. This is not only costly, and therefore a disincentive for owners to have errors corrected, but puts an unnecessary impost on our already heavily loaded courts. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes require no net additional expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 accommodate the Government's decision to extend the competitive grants scheme of the Industry Innovation Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has a two part strategy to encourage private business expenditure on research and development. The strategy consists of the 150% tax concession for research and development, which is now a permanent feature of the tax system, supplemented by direct grants to firms under the Industry Innovation Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business expenditure on research and development in 1991-92 reached a record $2.2 billion. In real terms this represents almost a doubling of business investment in R&amp;D over the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small and medium enterprises often lack the substantive cash flow to take advantage of the tax concession. The Industry Innovation Program grants scheme plays a valuable role in providing assistance to help these firms develop their capacity to undertake technological innovation. In 1994-95 approximately $40m will be available to assist projects under the Industry Innovation Program. A further $20m will be available in the first half of 1995-96. I am pleased that the government is able to continue to assist Australian firms to undertake research and development through this comprehensive package of measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A detailed explanation of the changes made by the bill is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators and I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INSURANCE LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 will substantially increase the level of protection for members of the public purchasing insurance products generally, and consumer credit insurance in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision, announced in July this year, on issues raised in a 1991 Trade Practices Commission report on consumer credit insurance and a subsequent report by a working party of officials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the major effect of this Bill is to amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to make the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner responsible for its general administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Insurance Contracts Act was introduced in 1984 to reform and modernise the law relating to insurance contracts. It aims to ensure that a fair balance is struck between the interests of insurers, insureds and other members of the public, and that the provisions of insurance contracts, and practices of insurers, operate fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It lays down a framework for insurance contracts, covering such matters as the duty of utmost good faith and information to be provided before a contract of insurance is effected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act has been self-administering, with no power for Government intervention to ensure that it is operating effectively. Administration by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will ensure that the operation of the Act is more closely monitored and, where necessary, enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commissioner will have power to monitor compliance with the Act, ensure that appropriate publicity and education functions are undertaken and, where it is in the public interest, take representative action on behalf of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is introducing this legislation in order to give added protection to members of the public who purchase insurance products. It acknowledges that the life and general insurance industries, through initiatives such as those in relation to complaint handling and dispute resolution, have brought about significantly better industry practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further amendments to the Act are expected to arise from the Commissioner's administration and from a broader review of its provisions which is being conducted by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I will now outline the amendments proposed to be made in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 now before the Senate. The amendments:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">make the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner responsible for the general administration of the Insurance Contracts Act, and provide for representative action on behalf of insureds by the Commissioner where this is in the public interest;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">require pre-sale, point-of-sale and post-sale notices to be given by insurers to purchasers of consumer credit insurance products. They also provide that similar notices may be prescribed for other types of insurance. These notices will improve the capacity of purchasers of insurance products to make informed decisions about insurance, particularly where it is sold as a part of a complex package involving other financial transactions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide a 14 day cooling-off period for purchasers of consumer credit insurance products;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amend Section 15 of the Insurance Contracts Act and repeal Subsection 87(1E) of the Trade Practices Act to clarify the right of access of insureds to the protection of the Trade Practices Act in relation to unconscionable conduct.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amend the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 to raise the statutory upper limit of levy which may be collected from $15,000 to $17,000 for general insurers and from $28,000 to $70,000 for life insurers.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the maximum levy which may be charged allows for recovery from the industries of the cost of administration of the Insurance Contracts Act. In the case of the life insurance levy, the amendment also provides for the increased costs of supervision that will arise from amendments to the Life Insurance Act which were announced by the Government in July 1993 and which are expected to be introduced into the Parliament next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures for added protection for purchasers of insurance products generally, and consumer credit insurance products in particular, will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Insurance and Superannuation Commission estimates that the additional resources needed to give effect to this package of measures will be $130,000 in 1993/94 (to be absorbed into the current ISC vote) and $336,000 each following year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional costs will be recovered through increases in the General Insurance Supervisory Levy and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy as already outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill No.2 1993 to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was the case in the development of the measures to combat overservicing, i.e. the measures that are specified in the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill 1993 introduced into the Parliament on 30 September 1993, the amendments outlined in this bill are the product of a close consultative process with the Australian Medical Association.  Once again the AMA has demonstrated an admirable willingness to come to grips with the issues and to offer positive suggestions for resolving current deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new measures in this bill are necessary because the current arrangements for dealing with fraud have proven to be deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) found in its Audit Report No. 17 1992-93, entitled "Medifraud and Excessive Servicing: Health Insurance Commission", that one of the principal impediments to an effective level of prosecutions was the inadequate investigative powers available to the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO expressed concern about the length of time for completion of cases referred to Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions and noted that in Victoria the average duration taken by the Australian Federal Police after the referral of a case was 224 days and the average taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions was 324 days. The ANAO also noted that some prosecutions had failed because of the length of time it had taken to get the cases to court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While concerned that the Health Insurance Commission was dependent on the priority allocated to cases by the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions, the ANAO did acknowledge that it had recommended in a 1990-91 audit report on the efficiency and effectiveness of fraud investigations by the Australian Federal Police that the investigation effort be directed to frauds that justify police resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO concluded that the investigative powers of the Commission should be significantly enhanced and recommended that consideration be given to the Health Insurance Commission being given the power to deal direct with the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Government has accepted that recommendation which is given effect in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for Health Insurance Commission investigators to be given reasonable powers to obtain relevant evidence. Those powers are progressive in nature in that the power to seek warrants to search for and seize relevant documents represents the extreme end of the powers to be given to the Commission. Other less intrusive methods will be adopted whenever possible. Only if it appears that co-operation in obtaining relevant information is impossible or if there is a serious risk that evidence may be destroyed will the right to search and seize documents be sought. Moreover, to ensure that there is consistency in decisions to seek such warrants, those decisions will be made centrally and limited to no more than a few senior Commission officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that some observers see the legislation as a sign by the Government of a lack of confidence in the Australian Federal Police, it should be noted that this is not the case.   The Australian Federal Police is expected to make its own judgments on what is the most effective way of using its investigation resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is one of the features of the Medicare benefits arrangements that individual instances of abuse of the system frequently involve relatively small amounts of money. It is often not appreciated that the real extent of abuse is considerably more than would be suggested by the cases that have been brought to court. The same may be said about cases of overservicing that have been referred to Medical Services Committees of Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another problem in dealing with fraud cases under Medicare is that the nature of the activities that are subject to investigation are often technical medical ones and subject to complex legislative provisions. This makes understanding the intricacies of certain cases particularly difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an unfortunate, albeit unavoidable, fact that many of the measures that have had to be taken in recent years to tackle abuse of the Medicare arrangements have served to add to the complexity of the legislation governing the payment of Medicare benefits. The result is that, apart from the practitioners affected and officers in the Health Insurance Commission who are required to have a detailed understanding of the technical and legal issues, many persons find it difficult to understand the health legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's view that it takes an adequate understanding of the Medicare Benefits Schedule and a sound understanding of the relevant legislation to effectively investigate Medicare fraud and to determine precisely what evidence is needed. Only the Health Insurance Commission is properly equipped to do this. Furthermore, unlike the Australian Federal Police, the Commission is in a position to direct its endeavours exclusively to the investigation of Medicare abuse and thus to reduce significantly the time currently taken to put a case to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the Health Insurance Commission to be empowered to require a person to provide such information that is required or to produce any documents in the custody or control of that person within a period of fourteen days after notice is given. It also provides that the Commission may require a person to appear, at a reasonable time and place, before a specified officer to answer questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further provision in the bill gives the Commission the authority to inspect premises and equipment where the use of the particular equipment is the basis for the payment of benefits or where there is reasonable suspicion that the premises are being used for services for which Medicare benefits have been claimed in breach of the Health Insurance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant power to be given to the Health Insurance Commission is the power, subject to the granting of a warrant by a magistrate, to search for and seize documents. These provisions have been modelled on the search warrant provisions of the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1993, currently before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes a provision that the providers of pathology services must keep records of those services and produce them to an officer of the Commission if requested. If the records contain clinical information about an individual, the records are to be produced to an officer of the Commission who is a medical practitioner. This provision is modelled on the current legislation relating to the maintenance, retention and production of records of diagnostic imaging services. It places the same obligations on the providers of pathology services as those of diagnostic imaging services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill does not attempt to recast in any major way the current provisions relating to inducements. Although certain professional groups have called for more action in this area, the fact is that the problem has too many dimensions to enable the issue to be resolved in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the opportunity has been taken to deal with more obvious abuses by minor amendments to section 129AAA, the Government believes that the provisions in this bill are too important to allow their introduction to be delayed pending the reaching of agreement on what specific additional action needs to taken on inducements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may also be that the investigation powers given to the Health Insurance Commission in this bill will enable it to successfully investigate the offering and seeking of inducements within the existing legislative provisions covering inducements. In any case, the Government will continue to examine the options.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the bill amends the Insurance Act 1973. This act provides the basis for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's financial and prudential supervision of general insurance companies conducting business in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is being taken to make minor amendments to this act. The proposed amendments will remove anomalies involving the valuation of shares in related insurance companies and investments in related unit trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They also provide for more commercial and administrative flexibility in directions made by the Commissioner where there is doubt as to the viability of an insurer, and make minor amendments to provisions dealing with the principal banker of an insurer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the bill also amends the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991 to make clear that phasing-in provisions dealing with the capital and solvency requirements of registered life offices apply only to those life offices registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945 at the date of the original amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the bill will give effect to measures that substantially increase the effectiveness of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This act protects the insuring public against the negligence or misconduct of an insurance agent or broker and encourages practices consistent with the interests of the insuring public, including standards of conduct and quality of advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It makes insurers responsible for the actions of their agents and provides a system of registration of insurance brokers and those agents acting on behalf of unauthorised foreign insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to more effectively discharge his responsibilities and will provide greater protection to purchasers of insurance through intermediaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments were developed  following a comprehensive review of the operations of the act by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, in consultation with industry, consumers and other interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments are based on this review and do not include consideration of matters arising from subsequent inquiries such as the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and Trade Practices Commission reviews of life insurance. These will be subject to further legislative proposals next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now provide a brief outline of the key amendments to be made to  the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments introduce a maximum 37 day period in which agents may hold premium moneys. This replaces a requirement that such moneys be passed to insurers as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so which has not worked effectively in practice.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this amendment is to set a maximum time that agents may hold premium moneys, while allowing normal commercial (monthly settlement) arrangements to operate. Special exemption arrangements will apply to underwriting agents who, because of the nature of their business, are not reasonably able to comply with these settlement arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments clarify the liability of insurers for the actions of their agents by making clear that insurers have joint and  several liability for agents who deal with more than one insurer. This will ensure that consumers are protected in the case where a multi-agent acts beyond the authority granted by his or her principals.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Multi-agents will be required to declare to all insurers with whom they have agency agreements the existence of any agency agreements they have with other insurers.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments ensure that the clients of brokers and unauthorised foreign insurers are better protected by requiring a no avoidance of claims clause and 3 year run-off cover in their compulsory professional indemnity insurance contracts. Any cancellation of such contracts will be required to be notified to the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments provide for the Commissioner to determine the type and form of audited accounts to be furnished by registered intermediaries. They also increase the power of the Commissioner to inspect documents and obtain information about the activities of intermediaries, whether for purposes of routine supervision or for prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They provide, subject to appropriate safeguards, the Commissioner with the scope to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of an intermediary who becomes insolvent or bankrupt, provides unsatisfactory accounts or otherwise fails to satisfy the obligations of an insurance intermediary.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments extend from 1 to 3 years the time allowed to the Commissioner to prosecute offences under the act. This is necessary because of the particular nature of many of the fiduciary offences under the act which, by their nature, take time to come to the Commissioners notice.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is also being taken to update the penalty provisions in the act and to introduce more meaningful penalties for serious offences such as failure to properly deal with premium moneys.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the proposed amendments lower the threshold at which there is considered to be an association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to one of 25 per cent ownership or control. They also make a number of other minor technical changes to the legislation to improve its operational effectiveness.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of Australia's bilateral air services agreements and arrangements embody an obligation that "substantial ownership and effective control" will reside in the nationals of the Contracting Party. The agreements generally provide authority for a Contracting State to withhold, revoke or suspend operating permission if the Party which has made the designation cannot demonstrate that its designated airline or airlines meet national ownership and control tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is bound under the Chicago Convention to supply to other Contracting States and/or the International Civil Aviation Organization information concerning the ownership and control of any particular aircraft registered in Australia and conducting international air services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is common practice in other countries to either exclude, or limit the extent of, foreign ownership in airlines. The Government's decision to limit equity holdings by foreign airlines in Australia's international airlines to 35% in aggregate and to 25% by a single foreign airline was announced on 22 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of the amendments in this bill is to enable the Government to ensure that any Australian carrier seeking designation or already designated on an international route can demonstrate its compliance with bilateral requirements that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled  by Australian nationals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will change the name of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act 1991 to the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 to reflect a change in the name of the company under section 382 of Corporations Law of the ACT. While the application of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Act to the company was unaffected by the change of the company's name, alignment of the name of the act with the name of the company will avoid any confusion on the part of the public. The company continues to trade in Australia as "Telecom Australia" and internationally as "Telstra OTC Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of consequential changes to the act consequential upon the name change of the company. Schedule 3 of the bill amends a number of other acts not within the Transport and Communications portfolio consequential upon the change of name.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments of the Navigation Act 1912</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Navigation Act is amended to consolidate into one section a number of provisions that allow exemptions to be granted from the requirement to comply with the act. Those provisions were inserted into the Navigation Act at various times and there is some overlap between the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Six existing sections in the Navigation Act are being combined by this bill into one section to provide that the Minister or the Australian Maritime Safety Authority may exempt a person or a vessel from the operation of specified provisions of the act. Amendment of section 377L will ensure that there is a right of review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision not to grant an exemption or to grant an exemption subject to conditions. Clause 4 of the bill will ensure the continued validity of any existing exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of Marine Pollution Legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends two acts which deal with marine pollution issues. In brief, the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 will provide that any loss, damage, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in performing its obligations to combat pollution in the marine environment will be able to be recovered at law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 will be amended to provide  for detention of foreign ships which are suspected of or have actually committed a pollution breach in the territorial sea or in Australia's exclusive economic zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Detailed safeguards are provided to ensure that any detention is consistent with the requirements of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and that any detained ship will be released with the minimum of delay after investigations and any necessary subsequent action have been completed or appropriate financial security provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of Telecommunications Act 1991</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes a minor amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1991 to implement the government's decision that the Indian Ocean Territories (Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands) are to be treated as part of Australia for the purposes of Commonwealth law. The amendment is consequential upon a 1992 amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act, which provided that Australia includes Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This minor amendment to the Telecommunications Act is the only amendment to the act necessary to implement the decision. It requires external territories to which the universal service obligation does not extend to be prescribed. The universal service obligation provides that access to, and supply of, the standard telephone service and payphones must be provided throughout Australia. Currently the obligation specifically does not apply in the external territories to which the act extends. The amendment will ensure that the universal obligation applies to the Indian Ocean Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in this bill are expected to have no significant effect on Commonwealth revenue or expenditure.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia was one of the first countries to take an interest in space. It participated in the British and United States' missile development programs and then in the European space program during the 1960's and 1970's using Woomera for rocket launches. During this period Australia became only the third country in the world to build and launch its own satellite from its own soil. However, for various reasons, Australia has not been able to capitalise on the early start.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, Australia is a major user of space technology. We are a world leader in radio astronomy and we were a foundation member of Intelsat and INMARSAT. The Australian government commissioned its domestic satellite system, now operated by Optus Communications. We are major users of remote sensing data in agriculture, fisheries, mining and forestry, for environmental monitoring and control, disaster situations and urban planning, as well as for meteorology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the Madigan Report in 1985, the government formed the Australian Space Board to manage the National Space Program. In 1988, the Board was asked by the government to review the program content of the National Space Program. This was conducted in 1991/92 by an Expert Panel. The Expert Panel's Report, "An Integrated National Space Program" was tabled by the former Industry Minister, Senator the Hon John Button. In 1992, the government generally accepted the Panel's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the organisational recommendations was to replace the existing Australian Space Board with an Australian Space Council embodied in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been some delay in bringing this bill before the Senate because of the intervening election. However, in order to maintain the impetus of the National Space Program, the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce established the Space Council, under administrative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Functions and Powers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The functions and powers of the Council are set out in Part 2 of the bill. These provide for the Minister to refer matters on space-related science and technology to the Council for inquiry and report. The Council is to develop and recommend to the Minister a National Space Program, which covers the space activities of both the public and private sectors. The Council is also required to review and report to the Minister on the outcomes of the National Space Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the space industry is fragmented between the Commonwealth and States, public and private sectors and industry and academia, it is essential that there be strong coordination and consultation mechanisms established to ensure the National Space Program reflects all interests. These requirements are explicit functions of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, the Council is to add value to Australia's expenditure in space related activity and extend the opportunities for private investment and wealth creation in international markets and in import replacement. It must advise on policy and its implementation. Importantly, it must create a basis for rational cooperation between agencies responsible for public investment. The National Space Program has to be truly national, not just a Commonwealth program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal source of funding for the National Space Program comes from the Commonwealth, so it is appropriate that the Minister have a power of direction over the Council. There is provision for the Council to report on any direction given unless this would be prejudicial to Australia's national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Five Year Plan</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the bill deals with Constitution, Meetings and Committees of the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major user of space in Australia at the moment is the Commonwealth. However, as mentioned, this use is fragmented across many Departments and agencies. It is proposed that Departments with a significant interest in space be full members of the Council. This will provide for a high level of coordination at the government level for the definition of public sector requirements and  contrasts with the previous Space Board where a number of Departments had only observer status and, as a consequence, were not seen as full stakeholders in the National Space Program. Full membership of the Council by stakeholder government Departments was one of the Expert Panel's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, senior officers of the Departments of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Transport and Communications, Defence, Arts and Administrative Services, Environment, Sport and Territories, Primary Industries and Energy and the CSIRO are members of the Council. Appropriate Ministers will be consulted on the government appointments to the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that, as far as practicable, the Minister ensure that the majority of members be drawn from industry and research institutes and that the Council should have an independent Chair. These measures will ensure that government members do not dominate the Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mix of membership between government, industry and academia will allow coordination between public and private sector space activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Funding</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the direct cost of the National Space Program administered by the Council is $6.064M per year.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Office is responsible for the management of the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex at Tidbinbilla, which is run on behalf of the United States National Aeronautical Space Administration. The value of the NASA contract is about $15M per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount provided for the National Space Program is modest, but the product spin off from space industry development is significant.

In relation to children entering Australia for adoption, guardianship powers of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs are immediately delegated to the relevant State or Territory Welfare Administrators by Instrument of Delegation under subsection 5(1) of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives effect, as far as the Commonwealth is able, to an understanding between the Commonwealth, States and Territories in 1990 that State and Territory governments would amend legislation to enable them to assume guardianship care for those children entering Australia for the purposes of adoption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amended legislation will not preclude the specified children from the guardianship of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs until States and Territories have been "declared" by gazettal notice.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it provides new procedures for enabling authenticated foreign testimony to be admissible, subject to appropriate safeguards, in certain criminal and civil proceedings. Secondly, it includes provisions to implement the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents and finally it re-enacts, with minor changes, Parts IIIB and IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new procedures for enabling foreign testimony to be used are in Parts 3 and 4 of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 3 makes foreign testimony and exhibits authenticated in a prescribed manner provided to Australia pursuant to requests made by or on behalf of the Attorney-General admissible in evidence, subject to specific exclusions in the interests of justice. The Part will apply in any court conducting criminal proceedings in relation to Commonwealth offences and related civil proceedings. (Related civil proceedings cover civil proceedings arising from the same subject matter from which the relevant criminal proceeding arose. They include proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Customs Act 1901 or proceedings for the recovery of tax, or of any duty, levy or charge payable to the Commonwealth).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide national uniformity, the States and Territories may request the Commonwealth to apply the Part, by regulations, to criminal proceedings or related civil proceedings in their courts for offences against the law of that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that traditional evidentiary safeguards are not undermined, the legitimate rights of the accused will be protected by way of the court having a wide discretion to refuse to admit foreign material. The court will be required to take certain specified matters into account when exercising its discretion, but will not be limited to those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also other safeguards, such as the requirements of authentication by the foreign country and certification by the Attorney-General and the non-admissibility of certain material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the present law, documentary foreign material available pursuant to mutual assistance treaties or arrangements frequently cannot be admitted into evidence unless witnesses are made available to give oral testimony in conformity with the traditional rules of evidence. Currently, only a small proportion of the material received from foreign countries is admissible as evidence without a foreign witness giving oral testimony in Australia. It is costly and cumbersome to make a foreign witness available in Australia. Implementation of the Part is expected to reduce the need for foreign witnesses to be made available, thereby lowering the overall cost of obtaining foreign evidence and improving the capacity of the courts to have regard to all relevant material received from foreign countries pursuant to requests by or on behalf of the Attorney-General. Implementation of the Part will improve the effectiveness of mutual assistance in criminal matters arrangements and thereby assist in complex prosecutions involving foreign evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A resolution passed by the National Complex White Collar Crime Conference in Melbourne in June 1992 called for action to overcome such deficiencies. Part 3 meets the concerns expressed in the resolution, whilst continuing to protect the legitimate rights of the accused.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the Bill sets out a similar scheme, adapted to meet the specific needs of the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) in civil proceedings arising from the Corporations Law and the ASC Law where the ASC is a litigant. The Part will facilitate the admissibility of foreign evidence in such proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The globalisation of capital markets in the past few years has required business regulatory agencies such as the ASC to liaise and offer assistance to each other in carrying out their regulatory functions. This will often result in requests by the ASC to foreign agencies for information, testimony and documents where the ASC is involved in civil proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 provides the ASC with the statutory framework to ensure that so far as practicable foreign material is successfully admitted in civil proceedings in which the ASC is a party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains provisions, in Part 5, implementing the Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, so that Australia can accede to the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention abolishes the requirement, imposed by many countries, for legalisation of foreign public documents. Legalisation is a system for authenticating an official document by certificates. Often a chain of certificates is required, and where the document is used in another country, frequently the final certificate is given, upon payment of a fee, by an official of a foreign embassy or consulate of the country where the document is to be used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention provides for the issue by a Convention country of a single certificate which is sufficient evidence to authenticate the signature or seal on the original document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Convention is concerned specifically only to abolish legalisation by a diplomatic or consular official of the country in which the public document is to be produced, the effect of the Convention is also to render unnecessary previous certificates in a legalisation chain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After accession Australian residents sending foreign public documents to countries which normally require legalisation, but which are parties to the Convention, will be able to obtain a certificate from an Australian authority, rather than having to get the documents legalised by foreign diplomatic or consular officials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Bill substantially re-enacts, with minor modifications, Parts IIIB and IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905. This is because the rest of that Act is being replaced by other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2 of this Bill, which replaces Part IIIB of the Evidence Act 1905, provides for obtaining testimony from a person in another country by means of an order for examination of the person, issue of a commission for examination of the person, or issue of a letter of request to the judicial authority of a foreign country to take the person's evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 6 of this Bill, which replaces Part IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905, sets out a procedure by which the Attorney-General can prevent, on national security grounds, testimony being given or documents or things being produced in Australia for proceedings before a foreign court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will provide less expensive means of obtaining some foreign evidence but is not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I table the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Purpose of the Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is for an Act to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. These amendments have become necessary to allow competitors, tested under proposed complementary State or Territory anti-doping legislation, to have access to the same appeal provisions as those available to competitors tested under the ASDA Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators are no doubt aware that Australia is at the leading edge in the fight against drugs in sport. The Government has made it quite clear through its legislation, and through the policies adopted by the Australian Sports Drug Agency (ASDA) and the Australian Sports Commission, that it is determined to ensure that athletes who cheat on their fellow competitors, their sport and themselves are not able to escape the sanctions they justly deserve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the ASDA Act only allows the selection of national level competitors to undertake drug tests. The testing of competitors below this level requires the enactment of State and Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All States and Territories have agreed that such legislation is desirable and have provided a commitment to its introduction. However, in order to ensure that there is a co-ordinated national approach, extensive discussions have been undertaken on the need for the States and Territories to introduce anti-doping legislation which is complementary to existing Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASDA Act was amended in July last year to include provision for the States and Territories to confer broader powers on ASDA to undertake testing of State and Territory level competitors </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">under complementary anti-doping legislation. The States and Territories are now able to introduce legislation allowing ASDA to test competitors defined in State and Territory legislation.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major Features of Bill</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that legislation introduced by the States and Territories is complementary to, and consistent with, the existing Commonwealth anti-doping legislation in all major respects. It is particularly important that there is consistency in the protection of the rights of the competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major element of the ASDA legislation relates to the protection of the rights of competitors who have been selected to provide a sample. The ASDA Act includes appeal provisions for all competitors who have failed to provide a sample or who have returned a positive test result. It is important that all competitors are treated equally and have equal access to such appeal provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes provision for the States and Territories to confer jurisdiction for review of decisions by ASDA following a positive test result, or failure by a competitor to comply with a request by ASDA to provide a sample for testing, on the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal or Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will enable the States and Territories to include in their complementary legislation provisions for access by competitors tested under State or Territory legislation to the same appeal provisions as are currently available to competitors tested under Commonwealth anti-doping legislation. This should ensure that a consistent uniform appeal mechanism is available to all competitors tested under any anti-doping legislation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current arrangements competitors tested under Commonwealth legislation may be listed on the register of notifiable events. The Bill includes provision for the names of competitors tested directly under State or Territory legislation, who have returned a positive test or who have failed without reasonable cause to provide a sample for testing, to be included on the register of notifiable events. The Bill also includes provision for the removal of names of competitors tested under State or Territory legislation from the register of notifiable events. These amendments provide for the same procedures to apply to competitors tested under State or Territory anti-doping legislation as currently apply under the ASDA Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria have each developed complementary anti-doping legislation and I understand that, as soon as the provisions in this Bill come into force, they will be seeking to introduce their legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to avoid variations in the drafting of anti-doping legislation in the States and Territories, and to ensure that all legislation is consistent, the Commonwealth has written to the States and Territories proposing that the drafting of the legislation be referred to the Parliamentary Counsels Committee. This committee consists of heads of Commonwealth, State and Territory offices of parliamentary counsel and will assist in the development of model complementary anti-doping legislation consistent with existing Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The model legislation can be adopted by each State and Territory and should avoid unnecessary variations in drafting between the ASDA Act and complementary legislation. The development of model legislation should also simplify and encourage the early introduction of consistent anti-doping legislation in each State and Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The successful introduction of complementary legislation in each State and Territory will enable ASDA to carry out tests on a considerably greater number of athletes. This will make it increasingly difficult for competitors who choose to use drugs to avoid detection. The introduction of this legislation will mean that Australia has one of the most stringent anti-doping policies of any country in the world and will send a clear message to the sporting community throughout the world that Australia will not tolerate the use of drugs in sport. I am sure that this will be taken into account by overseas athletes proposing to train and compete in Australia, particularly in the period leading up to and during the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this Bill. Additional testing by ASDA under State or Territory legislation, including the costs of the tests, will be the subject of agreements between ASDA and the respective States and Territories. All additional costs will be met by the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">OLYMPIC INSIGNIA PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Olympic Insignia Protection Act provides protection for what are collectively called the olympic insignia, namely the well-known representation of the five interlocking rings and the olympic motto "citius, altius, fortius", which in translation means "faster, higher, stronger".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This protection accrues to the benefit of the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC), formerly known as the Australian Olympic Federation, by providing it with a means to derive income by licensing the use of the insignia and of up to ten associated registered olympic designs, which are created by the Act for this specific purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Honourable Senators would no doubt be aware, the participation in, and the hosting of, an Olympic Games is an extremely expensive undertaking. As the Host Nation for the Year 2000 Games Australia will be expending considerable sums over the next seven years on the provision of infrastructure, facilities and organisation for this major event.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Events of the magnitude of the Olympic Games provide unparalleled business opportunities for the marketing of products and services. Official Olympic Games sponsors recognise these opportunities and are willing to pay considerable licence fees to the AOC for the rights to take advantage of these opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, at times like these there are always "freeriders" who wish to exploit the available opportunities without making any contribution. These are the businesses and organisations which indulge in what is commonly called "ambush marketing", an activity that was certainly rife in Australia around the time of the Barcelona Olympics, and, to a lesser extent, at the time of the Albertville Winter Olympics.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AOC, on behalf of the International Olympic Committee, is naturally concerned that as much as possible should be done to strengthen the protection afforded under the Act to the olympic insignia against this unauthorised commercial exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would have a twofold benefit. Firstly, it would protect the revenue base of the AOC, the body charged with overseeing Australia's participation in the Olympic Games, and secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it would ensure that Australia is in a position to assure the International Olympic Committee that Australian law gives effect, to as full an extent as possible, the obligations of the Olympic Charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I would now briefly like to detail the legislative changes made by the Olympic Insignia Protection Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most "technical" change made amends all references in the Act to the "Federation" to refer instead to the "Committee", as in 1990 the Australian Olympic Federation changed its name to the Australian Olympic Committee, or the AOC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another very minor amendment to the fee setting provisions of the Act will ensure that the application fees for registering designs under the Act, and for extending their protection periods, remain pegged to the corresponding fees in the Designs Act 1906.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments are more substantial and relate directly to the issues of protection which I have already outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently provides that the Registrar of Trade Marks must not register a trade mark which is comprised of, or contains, the olympic motto, or words very similar to the motto. As I stated before, the motto is the Latin "citius, altius, fortius". The Bill extends this prohibition on registration to the English translation of the motto&mdash;"faster, higher, stronger".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I referred earlier to the provision made in the Act for the registration of up to ten olympic designs. These designs, and the five interlocking rings, are designs in which the AOC has a monopoly and can license. This allows the AOIC, or the holder of a licence in relation to a protected design to take legal action if the monopoly in the design is infringed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill seeks to provide protection in much the same way for designs of the olympic torch and flame. A new design of the torch and flame is commissioned for each Olympic Games (both Winter and Summer), so, in terms of commercial advantage to the AOC, protection of these designs is only required for a limited period leading up to and following each Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The protection period proposed is from the beginning of three calendar years before the year of the particular Games, to the end of the year of that Games. This provides a maximum protection period of four years for any particular design, and because of the structuring of the time periods, minimises the potential for confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is because there will only ever be a maximum of two designs for the olympic torch and flame for which designs could be registered at the one time (one Winter Games design and one Summer Games design), and the overlap period will never exceed one year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The designs for the olympic torch and flame will be included in the maximum of ten registered designs allowed by the Act currently, as it ensures that when the AOIC no longer has a use for a logo or design it will pass into the public domain. There will be no provision for extending the period of protection for registered designs of the torch and flame, but it will be possible for the AOC to apply to have the protection period reduced if more commercial benefit could be gained from registering other designs as part of the "portfolio" of ten.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I am sure that we are all aware of the existence of trade marks, brand names and business names which have been operating for many years using the word "olympic", or some or all of the words comprised in the English translation of the motto, or indeed a representation of what could be an olympic torch or flame.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As there is no intention to acquire the rights which have accrued, both at common law and in these registrations, or affect existing rights in any way, the Bill clearly provides for the preservation of existing rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This includes any rights in the torch or flame which may have accrued to persons under the related legislative provisions of the Designs Act 1906 or the Trade Marks Act 1955 up to the time of the gazettal of the Statutory Rules prescribing the particular torch and flame design.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gazettal will take place no more than six months before the commencement of the relevant protection period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will limit the period in which common law rights, if any, might accrue in relation to the use of the olympic torch and flame.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, in recognition of the seriousness of the need for protection against unauthorised commercial exploitation, the Bill takes the unusual step of referring potential infringers to the remedies which are available under the Trade Practices Act against organisations whose conduct is misleading and deceptive and which make false representations as to sponsorship, affiliation or approval.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to take this opportunity to urge the AOC, as the body charged with responsibility for raising funds for participation in the Olympic Games to make optimum use of the Olympic Insignia Protection Act, as amended. I would also like to remind the AOC of the value and potential for use of other existing industrial and intellectual property legislative regimes which, after all, are also designed to provide a degree of market exclusivity and therefore protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A detailed explanation of the changes made by the Bill is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes brought about by the Bill require no net additional expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That there be laid on the table, by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) immediately after question time on 16 December 1993, a copy of the letter sent on 14 December 1993 by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) detailing the conditions which should be attached to woodchip export licences and indicating the forest coupes to be excluded from the relevant forest areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter specified in my motion is crucial for the decision regarding the woodchip export licences and will be made either today or tomorrow. It contains advice to the Minister for Resources on which areas of forest should be excluded from the export licences and will seal the fate of priceless areas of natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly has refused several requests to reveal the contents of this letter. As environment minister, she is accountable to parliament and the people of Australia, and in this chamber she is accountable via the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The minister therefore is not demonstrating that she can be trusted to act in the best interests of the environment. This chamber must be allowed to properly fulfil its role. Members of the community across Australia are extremely concerned about the fate of the forests in their areas and they have a right to know which areas will be protected and which will be excluded. Such vital issues cannot be settled behind closed doors and without the opportunity for public input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that Mrs Kelly had advice from her department that 81 forest coupes were to be excluded from the licences and that this number was considerably reduced by Mrs Kelly herself prior to taking the matter to cabinet on Monday. Mrs Kelly led the environment movement and the wider community to believe that she would force the government to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the moratorium clause in the national forest policy statement signed by the federal government more than a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By reducing the number of coupes to be protected by not forcing the immediate implementation of the national forest policy statement and by allowing the 1990 New South Wales forest logging agreement to override the national forest policy statement, the environment minister has failed in her duty to protect the environment. By these actions, Mrs Kelly has let down not only the environment movement but also the wider community. For these reasons, I have made the request and have moved this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will oppose this motion. In doing so, I indicate that the government retains complete confidence in Mrs Kelly as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. We reject absolutely the various allegations and suggestions that have just been made by Senator Chamarette about Mrs Kelly's commitment to environmental issues, standards and the environmental movement in this country. She is a very competent minister who is very conscious of her responsibilities in her own portfolio, but also very conscious of her responsibilities to the government and to the interests of the nation as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter to which Senator Chamarette refers contains advice from the minister, Mrs Kelly, to the Minister for Resources, Mr Lee, on the applicability of the national forest policy statement to the exercise of Mr Lee's statutory responsibility in relation to the granting of export licences. It was agreed by the cabinet in recent discussions that Mrs Kelly should provide this advice to Mr Lee so that he would be appropriately informed in the exercise of his&mdash;not her, but his&mdash;statutory responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's hope and expectation that it will be possible to reconcile the terms of our agreement with the New South Wales government and also the terms of the national forest policy statement. Nobody suggests that that is an easy matter. It will be one for Mr Lee's discretion, and it is appropriate that he have all available information and advice when he makes that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, both ministers have indicated&mdash;both Mrs Kelly and Mr Lee&mdash;that it would be quite inappropriate to table the letter as it is a confidential communication between ministers on a matter of high government policy. It represents a working document which is part of a deliberative process involved in the functions of government. There are, in the opinion of the government, no public interest reasons for tabling this letter. Final decisions on export licences will be a matter of public knowledge, of course, and people will have ample opportunity at that stage to set in train any debate they want to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one final point in this respect. As the letter raises specific matters in relation to woodchip export approvals relating to particular companies, it also contains information which may well be of a commercial-in-confidence nature and, as such, that is an additional ground for the government declining to produce the document in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate that that is the government's position. Without taking any further time, I simply state that we will be opposing this motion. I hope the Senate will appreciate the need for government to work in a way that makes possible communications of this kind without having every such communication being the subject of intense public spotlight. There is, of course, a public interest in the final decision in this matter but, as I said, there will be ample opportunity for that public interest to manifest itself at that stage. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows:</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the withdrawal of Senator Watson's amendment in the Committee stage of the passage of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill, a referral to the Superannuation Committee was made. The Committee was required to inquire and report on the implications of the withdrawn amendment concerning section 14 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tenth Report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has specifically examined the issues surrounding the operation of section 14 and 15 of the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act. In doing so the Committee has made four recommendations which are aimed at preventing any adverse consequences arising out of the uncertainty of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in relation to decisions of trustees, made prior to the commencement of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report concerns the problem of double payments that might result from appeals to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. This problem has been explained fully in previous debates but briefly the problem is that where a trustee has made a payment to a beneficiary, and the Tribunal determines that another person is entitled to all or part of that benefit, a trustee might be required to pay the benefit twice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the ramifications of this that has created the need for the Committee's tenth report. Where the trustee does not have the power to pay the second benefit ordered by the Tribunal, a serious blow to the confidence in the scheme as a whole to make payments, will be delivered. Members will feel that their funds may not end up benefiting themselves or those they desire, thereby playing on one of the major fears that consumers have about the administration of the superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are additional problems facing trustees and members of funds which the Committee has identified. First, where the trustees are unable to recover the initial benefit payment, they themselves may become personally liable to make the second payment. Second, as this situation is totally unacceptable for the trustees, their subsequent action in response may be damaging to other beneficiaries of the fund. A fear expressed by the Committee is that there may be a postponement of all payments for the time up to the commencement of the Act on 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However under section 15, the trustee can gain a degree of protection against the danger of a double payments problem. By giving adequate notice to all relevant parties of a proposed benefit payment the trustee  excludes any such party from appealing to the Tribunal against this payment, unless they first object to the trustee within a prescribed period. This provision greatly reduces the danger of the trustee being required to pay a benefit twice. The critical point here is that it is not conclusive as to whether this protection will apply to trustees who have given notice prior to the commencement of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the only certain protection for trustees is to wait until the commencement of the Act. The danger is trustees may choose to postpone all further payments until this period has elapsed. Overwhelmingly, the view expressed by the superannuation lawyers, who submitted to the inquiry, was that this would indeed be the case. In the meantime beneficiaries that depend on the fund for their livelihood are left in limbo, receiving no benefits and subsequently suffering great hardship. It is for this reason that the Committee has recommended that both the Government and the Senate seek to clarify this position. It is the opinion of the Committee that the section 15 protection for trustees, which entails the giving of adequate notice, should apply to decisions made before and after the commencement of the Act. The result of this is that by giving adequate notice to all relevant parties, not only will the interested parties be clearly aware of their rights but also, objections must then be made within the prescribed period. The advantage of this, is that the risk of trustees being required to pay a benefit twice is substantially reduced. Also there will be no reason for the trustees to delay other benefit payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order for trustees to give notice that complies with section 15, it will be necessary for them to do so within the `prescribed period'. The Committee recommends that the prescribed period in section 15(2)(a)(ii) should be 28 days. This will mean that subsequent to the death of a member, trustees will notify potential beneficiaries. If the Committee's recommendation is taken up, these potential beneficiaries will have 28 days to object to a proposed payment. If a person does not object within the prescribed period, they will not have an interest and will not be able to make a complaint to the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has concluded that the problem of double payments and the consequences that surround it will always exist. However, the adverse effects of this problem can be minimised. The Committee wishes to emphasise the ways in which trustees and beneficiaries can assist in ensuring that disputes such as these and all other superannuation disputes are kept to a minimum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of paramount importance is that trustees give notice to persons who may have an interest in a payment. It cannot be stressed strongly enough that trustees commence this procedure as soon as possible. Trustees should also ensure that fund members complete all the forms required to nominate beneficiaries. Fund members play an equally vital role in the process. By notifying their superannuation fund if their family circumstances change, members assist in minimising the possibility of dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, in examining these issues the Committee became aware of a dearth of relevant statistical data. The Committee has recommended that from its inception the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal establish procedures and structures to collect appropriate data on claims submitted to it by superannuation fund members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is hoped, that by following all of these recommendations the significant problems posed by the complaints process, specifically those of double payments, can be minimised if not wholly avoided. It is the aim of the Committee that through these processes all the interests involved can best be served.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before completing this speech I would like to make a number of brief remarks about the work of the Committee during the Budget sittings, and its program for 1994, to satisfy the requirement that the committee report on the last day of the Budget sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Budget 1993 sittings the Committee presented its 8th, 9th and 10th reports. I might also add that during the winter recess the committee presented its 6th and 7th reports to the President of the Senate. Without doubt the most important of these reports was the 9th which addressed the Superannuation Industry Supervision package of Bills. The work of the Committee in this inquiry was  critical to the final shape of the legislation, and for this I place on record my appreciation of the efforts of my fellow Senators on the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If 1993 has been the year of consolidation in the super industry following the events of 1992, which included the introduction of the SGC, 1994 will, I believe, prove to be a year of metamorphosis. The Committee will be examining moving from 9&mdash;12 per cent levels of minimum superannuation contributions, allocated pensions and their interaction with the social security system as well as the question of whether super funds should be in the business of financing member housing purchases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt the super industry will watch closely the implementation of the new SIS provisions and the role of the prime regulator, the ISC, in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consumers will be interested in the work of the new disputes tribunal which will commence on 1 July 1994 and be closely monitored by this Committee. I expect that consumers will also be interested in the initiatives that the Government will take to ensure that women, part-time employees and those on low wages  are able to maximise their superannuation assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect that the national stock of super fund assets will continue to grow and that in 12 months time it will approach the $200 billion mark. That of course will depend on a number of factors, not the least of which is the performance of the various financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that the Select Committee will continue its monitoring role advising the Senate on a range of superannuation policy-related matters. If past practice is any guide I expect the Committee to be at the cutting edge of public debate on retirement incomes policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, in conclusion, I commend the report to the Senate and I thank Committee members, Senators John Watson (who, through illness, is unable to present this report), Bruce Childs, Christopher Evans, Alan Ferguson, John Woodley, and the secretariat staff, Richard Gilbert, Krista Gerrard, Glenn Hunter, Cath Drinkwater and Stephen Wood for their work in developing this report in the shortest of time frames.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now pretty much towards the end of the second reading speeches on one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before the parliament&mdash;and arguably the most far-reaching set of proposals&mdash;with enormous implications not just for the Aboriginal community and for Aboriginal rights but also for the future economic development of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would certainly be appropriate for me to say at the outset, as have many of my predecessors in this debate, that the opposition fully recognises the need to accept the High Court decision and what flows from it, to acknowledge the role that the Racial Discrimination Act will play in all future dealings in this matter, and, finally and by no means least importantly, to also state our firm view that land management issues are the responsibility of the states. We say that not simply on the basis of some sort of arid notion of states rights but very much because the constitution makes it clear that that is where the responsibility lies, and does so for very good reason. The reality is that the states are the ones which have to administer the way in which land title is handled and, of course, they are the ones which have to accept day-to-day responsibility in that area. That is why, of course, this bill needs to be dealt with in the most thorough and comprehensive manner possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of all of the complexities and difficulties with which many lawyers have been trying to grapple in recent months and, indeed, since the bill was introduced, I think we have so far reached only the stage where there is a whole range of conflicting views about what many of the sections mean. We have, as recently as yesterday, received 189 amendments: 74 government amendments, 32 amendments from the Australian Democrats, and 83 amendments from the Greens. The consequence of that is that it is absolutely impossible for the Senate to give sensible consideration to the implications of those amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an attempt to refer this matter to a Senate select committee. Unfortunately, that was not supported. Instead, we had to make do with a very hasty consideration of the matter by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which, in the time available to the committee, did an excellent job. The committee was not able, however, to travel to the main population centres of Melbourne and Sydney. It was not able to take evidence from people who were in a position to put this legislation in its proper social context and perspective. Accordingly, there is much more that needs to be done before anyone can claim to be able to understand the full ramifications of this legislation. It is no consolation to say that this will be a lawyers' picnic, because I do not think anyone has an interest in seeing inordinate delays, inordinate complexities and inordinate expenses incurred quite unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have to remember that the government's first substantive response to the June 1992 decision did not come for at least 12 months thereafter. So there was no dramatic urgency in the early stages. Indeed, as members of the Aboriginal community have been quick to point out on many occasions, they have had to wait some 200 years before their rights have been recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, there can be no earthly justification for railroading this legislation through the parliament in the way the government is proposing to do. Quite clearly, it is yet another example of the approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to these matters: get out on the highway, do a few delicate balancing tricks, throw a few balls in the air and leave it to others to pick up the pieces. That, of course, is nowhere near good enough for any legislation, but certainly for legislation with the enormous significance and ramifications of the Native Title Bill. It is utterly unacceptable. There is no need for this legislation to be rammed through the parliament, other than to meet the government's own political convenience. That ought to be the last justification for any such undue haste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look at the experience in Canada, where there has been an Indian act for 117 years. Canada is currently in the process of dealing once more with a whole range of native title issues, and a royal commission on aboriginal affairs is required to report by 1995 to recommend a suitable framework for negotiation and settlement of outstanding issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In British Columbia, land claims currently cover an area equal to 130 per cent of the province. Investment and exploration in mining in British Columbia have fallen significantly in recent years. In other words, legislation is not by any means the end of the matter. It is really the start of a long and tortuous process. The more complicated the bill and the act are at the outset, the more difficult it will be to untangle all of those complexities. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that what we should be doing at this stage is allowing further time for this matter to be properly considered, ideally by a select committee, but at the very least by a whole range of community interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly not speaking just about the pastoral and mining industries, which have, I think, very important and legitimate concerns, indeed going wider than their own industries. We all ought to have concerns about the economic consequences of this legislation because our future economic growth and prosperity will determine in large measure our ability to meet the cost of addressing Aboriginal disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to be on the record as saying that, having travelled in outback Australia on many occasions over the last 15 or 20 years, I have seen at first hand the enormity of the task. It ought to be clear to anyone who has made even an occasional visit that we simply cannot address these issues by acknowledging land rights or native title rights which, as Noel Pearson acknowledges in respect of this bill, will benefit directly only five per cent of the Aboriginal community. The overwhelming task is to be able to address social and economic disadvantage on the part of the Aboriginal community and all the health, education, housing and welfare needs that will be with us indefinitely, as far as we can see at this stage. The capacity to afford those depends crucially upon Australia's economic future. To brush aside the concerns of the pastoral and mining industries is utterly short-sighted and indeed ultimately counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought also to be said that the Aboriginal community itself is very concerned about the way in which the government has tried to ram this legislation through the parliament. A meeting of some 200 Aborigines only a couple of days ago called for this matter to be delayed. One has only to look at the appendix to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs to see that there are very widespread groups of individuals who similarly want to see further time allowed to digest the complexities of this legislation. Therefore, it is my intention to move that there be a further period available before this matter is finally processed by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened very carefully to what the Greens have had to say in recent days. If we assume that they are not simply putting forward an ambit claim, if we assume that they do have the sincerity of their public statements and if we assume that the government will not accommodate them in all their demands, quite clearly the Greens ought to be voting against this legislation. If they do not, if and when that time arrives, they will be exposed as simply making rhetorical claims. I do not at this stage want to prejudge their attitude to the legislation, but what I think is critically important is that they themselves should acknowledge that it is not in anyone's interests that these matters be pushed through the parliament in the way in which the government is proposing to do for its own political purposes. It is not in anyone's interests. Therefore, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the debate be now adjourned.</PARA>
<PARA>I indicate that I will subsequently move a motion that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for the first day of sitting in February 1994. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In winding up the second reading debate on Mabo, I state that this is unequivocally one of the most important pieces of legislation ever to come before this parliament. Accordingly, it deserves to be treated with utmost seriousness by all of us. I thank those who have contributed in that spirit during the second reading debate. I hope that in the forthcoming committee stage debate we will again focus, with the appropriate degree of seriousness and sense of responsibility, on the great issues that are involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the nature of the bill before us, I think its component elements were very well summarised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his second reading speech. There are four key aspects of the legislation: first, ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title; second, provision for clear and certain validation of past acts&mdash;including grants and laws, if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title; third, the creation of a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and, fourth, rigorous, specialised, and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title, and for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants over native titled land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill thus constructed on those foundations has&mdash;during the second reading debate&mdash;been subjected to a degree of assault both from the right, the opposition, and to some extent from the left, particularly from the contributions of the Greens. The assault from the right has had the following elements: that the bill is defective, and should be rejected or deferred on the grounds of its complexity and its alleged unworkability, unconstitutionality, unfederal character, and  unfunded status and its alleged contribution to uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These further points have been made: that the Aboriginal negotiators who have laboured so long and mightily to produce this document with the government are not representative; that there are still some divided views in the Aboriginal community; that&mdash;and this point has been made in a number of speeches&mdash;the bill is divisive; that it is in contrast with Parkes's original vision of one nation, one destiny; that the bill will lead to two nations; and that it will contribute to the very opposite of the reconciliation that we are seeking to achieve. The government obviously does not accept any of those criticisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some brief points in response. The bill has been the subject of a very protracted consultation process&mdash;a very open and transparent consultation process&mdash;with all key segments of the community. The elements of that consultative process were well summarised and spelt out in the Senate committee report and there is no need for me to repeat those elements here. The states have all been very much involved in that process, including Western Australia; notwithstanding what Senator Crane and others have had to say on that subject. It is not a matter of Mr Court being locked out of COAG or out of any consultative process. He chose to keep himself out of it. His officials have certainly been very much involved in that consultation on many occasions, both before and after that meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does give security to commercial and economic interests while, at the same time, providing justice for indigenous Australians. It is not a matter of the balance being tilted wildly in one direction or the other. It would only be fair if the opposition were prepared to acknowledge the degree of balance that has been achieved. The way in which that balance works itself out, clause by clause, no doubt will be the subject of detailed debate in the committee stage. I do not pre-empt that now. I simply make the claim&mdash;I think on thoroughly justified foundations&mdash;that that balance is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not creating two nations in this legislation, but establishing a process whereby, for the first time, newly recognised indigenous property rights can be registered and taken into account within the existing property law framework of this nation. We do not accept for a moment that the bill has any constitutional concerns associated with it. It has been very carefully drafted, very meticulously drafted, to cover off every possible objection on this score. If there is a challenge&mdash;and I guess we can inevitably expect one, not least from Western Australia&mdash;that will be for grounds of political motivation, not legal anxiety or any legitimate endeavour to defend the terms of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, so far as its alleged unfederal character is concerned, provides the most extensive possible opportunities for the states to maintain their primary role in land management, a primary role which the government is very ready to acknowledge. Recognised state bodies and processes will continue to operate within the framework of this bill, consistently with the national standards that are set down by it. There is not an attempt to recreate machinery that is otherwise effectively there for that purpose, unable to be mobilised for that purpose. The states' interests, to that extent, have been amply taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the bill does override&mdash;it is explicitly designed to have that effect&mdash;the Western Australian legislation. It does so for the very good reason that that legislation is simply manifestly unacceptable in this day and age, and in the light of the spirit of national reconciliation that we are trying very actively to recreate, particularly in the aftermath of the High Court's Mabo decision. That legislation involves a number of fundamentally unacceptable elements: in the first place and, overwhelmingly most importantly, the compulsory wholesale extinguishment of native title, a title which is now embodied in the common law. It overrides the inherent right of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who meet those criteria embodied in the law now. It involves the mandatory replacement of that right by a statutory title, one only conferred at the pleasure of government, one that can be extinguished in particular cases virtually at a minister's whim. It involves the establishment of a land management regime which provides only the flimsiest protections for Aboriginal people, protections far less than other land-holders enjoy. They are the reasons we believe that that Western Australian legislation should not only be overridden, but quickly put in its place by Commonwealth enactment putting beyond doubt the stature and continued status of the native title that has now been recognised by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as objections from the left, as it were, are concerned, I guess they can be roughly summarised as follows: that Aboriginal people want recognition of their status as the prior owners of this land, and that some kind of sovereign treaty is really what is required; that the High Court judgment was conservative, providing no inherent right to compensation for dispossession; that the bill is unsatisfactory because, in some alleged respects, it leaves Aboriginal people worse off; and, of course, we have had the recurring argument that the process has been unsatisfactory in terms of those who have been involved in the negotiation and the character of the government's motivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very quickly, in response to those points might I just say this: from any conceivable perspective, the bill does not leave Aboriginal people worse off. There are very considerable benefits inherent in the very structure of the legislation and there is the fact that it will override the Western Australian legislation which would leave them manifestly worse off. But more than that, more than the statutory recognition of native title and the statutory protection of native title that is inherent in this legislation, we do have the very explicit provisions that are manifestly beneficial: the establishment of the land fund; the provision for just terms compensation; the constraints on extinguishment of title that might otherwise apply if the common law were left to run its course; the tribunal process that has been established; and, the provisions for conversion of Aboriginal pastoral leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a series of provisions which do, in our judgment on any view, constitute special measures within the meaning of that expression in the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Australian Racial Discrimination Act. The delay of this bill or, even worse, its rejection, would not only leave Aboriginal people considerably worse off for all the reasons I have already mentioned, but we believe that delay or rejection would constrain or limit the prospects for future benefits accruing on a really quite significant scale in the future. The detailed objections that the Greens and others might have will again be the subject of debate in the committee stage. I will not now go into any further detail about those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just say a final word about the kind of process that we have in mind for the debate in the committee stage. I do think it is important that these serious issues, as I said at the outset, be tackled seriously, systematically and responsibly by this chamber. It is proposed, after the motion for the second reading is put and carried in just a moment's time, that the debate then be adjourned to a later hour this day in order to enable two things to happen. Firstly, the Senate needs to consider a number of other pieces of legislation which need to be passed this session. Many of them have amendments associated with them which need to go back to the House of Representatives, so for the orderly management of the process from now on it would be helpful if that legislation could be debated and got out of the way first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it will allow the lapse of some hours before we get on to the committee stage, which will enable amendments which have yet to be tabled and circulated by the Democrats and the Greens in particular to be tabled. It will also enable the preparation of running sheets that will hopefully help the orderly management of the debate. The government's own amendments&mdash;over 70 of them, but constituting in practice only something over 30 different substantive areas&mdash;were, of course, tabled and circulated together with a supplementary explanatory memorandum yesterday. Accordingly, there has been opportunity, I hope, for those amendments to be understood and absorbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed, and this has been the subject of discussion with most others in this chamber, that when we get to the committee stage the amendments be grouped so as to bring together in one place all the amendments bearing on a particular subject area, even though there may be three or four amendments scattered over the whole course of the bill which bear upon that subject matter. Hopefully, quite shortly such a grouping of the government amendments will be circulated. I hope it will be possible during the course of the day equally to group the Greens' and the Democrats' amendments in a way that we can bring together the key elements of the debate and, in effect, debate cognately the amendments bearing upon each particular substantive issue as it arises in turn during the course of the debate. If it is appropriate or helpful to not put all the amendments thus grouped together but rather to put the amendments separately, we will of course do that as each occasion arises during the course of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that, approached in that way and in that spirit, it will be possible to deal with quite a complex committee stage expeditiously and in the spirit that really is necessary for legislation of this magnitude.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the committee's attention to a potential disadvantage facing many early-balancing companies, which are companies with a substituted accounting period after 30 November 1993. These companies may be denied the nine-week deferral of tax payments referred to in clause 165 of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) in the event that the bill, if passed, is not presented for royal assent before the time the payments of tax in question fall due. Thus, for example, an early-balancing company with a taxation year ending on 31 December 1993 in lieu of the succeeding 30 June 1994 would be disadvantaged in relation to later-balancing companies if it did not become entitled to rely on the deferral referred to in the bill before 28 January 1994 when the payment of tax in question would ordinarily fall due. I ask the minister whether he can give an assurance that royal assent to the bill will be granted prior to 31 December 1993. If that does not happen, as I understand it, those early-balancing companies will be disadvantaged. </PARA>

<PARA>Those amendments were circulated some time ago by Senator Watson on behalf of the opposition. The purpose of the coalition's amendments to the government's retrospective amendment in relation to petroleum activities, which is contained in clause 18 of the bill&mdash;I stress that clause 18, as now drafted, is a retrospective move by the government&mdash;is to ensure that the amendments affected by division 2 of part 4 apply only in relation to taxpayers who claim a deduction on and from the date of the press release of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on 4 August 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In simple terms, the effect of the opposition's amendments is as follows: firstly, in cases where taxpayers have not previously claimed a deduction, the government's amendments would apply from the date of the introduction of the original amendments in 1990. Taxpayers who have legitimately claimed a deduction prior to August 1993 will be allowed that deduction. Taxpayers who have not claimed a deduction prior to 4 August 1993 will not be permitted to seek to amend their returns to claim a deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's amendments have the support of the following bodies, all of which have grave concerns about the retrospective element of the government's own clause: the Law Council of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Taxation Institute of Australia and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. The reason for the coalition's amendments is our concern about the length of time&mdash;two years&mdash;that it took the Australian Taxation Office and the government to bring about the change that is now contained in the bill. The apparent effect of the 1991 amendments was raised on two separate occasions by the professional bodies: firstly, at the National Tax Liaison Group Foreign Income Measures Subcommittee meeting, which was held as long ago as 26 September 1991, at which the Taxation Office representatives noted that the matter would be examined; and, secondly, at a later National Tax Liaison Group Foreign Income Measures Subcommittee meeting held on 2 February 1992, at which Taxation Office representatives advised that the matter was still being examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the time that has elapsed since those meetings, it is not unreasonable for tax advisers to assume that the ATO has accepted that the relevant provisions operated according to their tenor. This assumption was reinforced by the lack of a timely response by the ATO and the absence of any notice,  other than a press release, that an amendment was forthcoming. We understand that the ATO has issued at least one private ruling&mdash;it may have issued others&mdash;to particular taxpayers acknowledging the deductibility of these expenses. The ATO will now have to discover a way to deal with these cases, given that all taxpayers must be treated in the same way on an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally&mdash;and I believe this is a fundamental point&mdash;the proper administration of taxation laws depends on the cooperation and goodwill of professional bodies. I put it to the government that that process will break down if the ATO or the government acts retrospectively, to the detriment of the professional bodies and their clients, as a result of these issues of concern being raised. This issue has all the hallmarks of delay, similar to the procrastination that was associated with the notorious handling of the bottom of the harbour arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I hasten to add that, until the bottom of the harbour time, the deductions were legal and written in black-letter law in the statute. There was no ambiguity in the statute law enacted in 1991, hence there was no need to refer to a second reading, et cetera. The coalition is moving this amendment to clause 18 to remove that retrospective element. We believe it is a very serious matter. Therefore, I hope the amendment will have the support of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although we did cover this in the second reading debate and I do not wish to duplicate that, Senator Short has properly put the case on the record and I do not want it to stand uncommented upon. Senator Watson, Senator Kernot and I have essentially traversed this in a previous debate. If people want to see an extensive recording of it, they should consult that record. I will not duplicate it. It is an important issue of balance, and nobody could deny that the process by which this matter has been handled has been unduly delayed. I accept that and I do not seek to defend it. It should not have occurred in that manner. It is a complex and difficult issue. It could not have been dealt with in a day or a week, but the process has been too long, and we made that point before. Nevertheless, the balance of public interest in this matter is clear, notwithstanding that concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are doing two things with this. First, we are making the tax law mean what it was intended to mean. Second, we are confirming a basic principle of tax law&mdash;that you cannot allow deductions for expenditure incurred for the purpose of producing exempt income. I reiterate that those two principles are correct, although they may be uncomfortable from the government's point of view in this circumstance because of the procedures. They are not merely arcane matters of principle. The cost to the revenue of the defect, if allowed to stand, could exceed $1 billion. If you do not accept the principle, opt for the money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a lot of private rulings given, but my understanding&mdash;and the tax office has sought to confirm this&mdash;is that there has not been such a positive private ruling in this matter. I cannot be absolutely sure because there is no capacity to check quickly every ruling that has been issued to every taxpayer in a private capacity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I guess that that will be confirmed or otherwise in due course. Regarding Senator McMullan's revenue figure of $1 billion, I do not know how well based that is. But the coalition cannot resile in any way from its basic objection to any retrospectivity in the taxation law. We have had this debate for a long time now. Retrospectivity is death to equity and fairness in taxation. The coalition's understanding of clause 18, as now drafted, is that it is retrospective. Therefore, we will be pressing this amendment. If we do not, then we are saying as a parliament, as a Senate, that retrospectivity is okay simply because the Taxation Office has been tardy in doing its job. That is a fundamental point with which we could not agree.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is my advice, and it is not really surprising. Just before I come to Senator Harradine's point, I refer to something Senator Short said. He said that the opposition's understanding of the proposal is that it is retrospective. I do not deny that; it is. I do not deny that that is an action with which we are not comfortable and that it must be taken only in the most extraordinary of circumstances. I do not seek to say that this is a way in which the tax law should, in the normal course of events, be handled. The broad thrust of what he said about retrospectivity is, I think, shared by the whole parliament, so I am not trying to challenge that principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate to Senator Harradine that I cannot personally verify the arithmetic, but the order of magnitude is not really surprising. Although the number of companies affected by this is limited, it is a very large flow of income and of expenditures which might otherwise be able to be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is a possibility that people may be able to claim as deductions against their taxable income in Australia a very large amount of expenditure which was earning income that is exempt from Australian taxation. Senator Kernot outlined the order of magnitude of the numbers of companies involved: if all those companies that had not claimed these deductions were to proceed to do so, it is unquestionable that it would be hundreds of millions of dollars. I cannot stand here and say in blood that it would be a billion because I do not know, but there must be, unequivocally, hundreds of millions of dollars flowing from taxpayers to companies. In that instance, they will be acting entirely in accordance with the law because the Senate would have resolved that that is what they are entitled to do. I hope the Senate does not resolve that, but I would not criticise it for doing it. We would have, in effect, carried a motion; we would have opened a door and invited them in. We cannot blame them for passing through the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be flowing to companies and reducing our capacity otherwise to fund things that we properly should, not at the moment by intention of the parliament but by inadvertence. I do not think that sort of windfall by inadvertence should be allowed to proceed, notwithstanding that it is a very rare circumstance when anybody in this parliament would vote for legislation that has that retrospective effect. I can envisage other circumstances. The outcome of Capital Duplicators may well have been another circumstance in which we may have done that on behalf of the states, but it is not something we would seek to do in the normal course of events. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's amendments contained in clause 137 will exempt the RSPCA from sales tax on goods used mainly in carrying out inspections and operating animal shelters. It will provide a credit to the RSPCA of sales tax paid on goods used in inspectorial and shelter activities that are purchased in the period 13 March 1993 until this bill receives royal assent. The coalition certainly welcomes that move. But there is an element of unfairness in granting the RSPCA that exemption when the largest companion animal shelter in Victoria, the Lost Dogs Home, which is doing exactly the same rescue and shelter work as the RSPCA, does not have this sales tax exemption extended to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have discussed exactly the same principle, in broad terms, on previous occasions when we have discussed this matter. I have a concern about specifying particular organisations in the tax legislation rather than categories of organisations or activity so that the same activity conducted by different organisations is taxed in the same way. It is not something I would do lightly. In fact, I argued against it on a previous occasion when an amendment was proposed to the sales tax legislation to exempt the RSPCA.

It is something we will have to consider over the medium term, but for the moment we are making a one-off exemption for the RSPCA. I do not deny his point of principle, but we are not going to introduce a new category into the sales tax exemptions. I would prefer never to make one-off things like this.

I think the RSPCA has a range of activities that none of the others can claim to have. Each of the activities it undertakes is undertaken somewhere else by someone else, but probably no-one else has the range. It is not a well-developed body of tax principle we are implementing here; it is a one-off thing that conflicts with tax principle, as properly constructed, but it helps a worthwhile organisation. If every time we make a one-off exception like this we get attacked because it does not deal with the whole 110 organisations, we can never make such exceptions.</PARA></TALK.START>

I know that the RSPCA has been working for a long time, but the government is opening up the gates. I have never really come to a conclusion about whether or not I will support the organisation. I always give non-committal answers. I am not used to doing that about anything. Once the gates have been opened, there will be a renewal of fervour by the Lost Dogs Home and then by lost cats, lost canaries, lost people, lost Democrats and so on. It will give them more reasons to go ahead. I welcome the one-off exemption for the RSPCA, in a way, but the trouble is that the government has opened up the gates and it will have two or three next year and four or five the year after.

I was a little late coming in, but I heard Senator Kernot say, `We cannot support Senator Short's motion because $1 billion may have escaped'. I thought at the time that Senator Short's amendment was pretty good. What I would like Senator Kernot to think about is the fact that every new tax act that comes in raises far more money than the government intended. I know that this has applied to the two principal taxes in the last seven or eight years, the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax, and it applies to any new tax. But the government does not then say that it will cut the rate or give some of it back, or something like that. We have to balance that against what may have gone out the door. In the case of the RSPCA, we have to see how much more is going to go out the door with the lobbying that will go on. We will probably find another worthy cause. I urge the minister to proceed with caution on this matter&mdash;something that I seldom do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of additional points I want to raise. If I do not, apart from anything else, Senator Watson will kill me. The points refer to part 10 of the bill, which deals with amendments to the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. I am referring to clauses 144 to 152 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993. I note with some concern the proposed amendments to the shortfall provisions of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act. Those amendments are designed to allow a superannuation guarantee shortfall component to be paid into a complying approved deposit fund, or ADF, and to ensure that any shortfall component received by a complying ADF is a taxable contribution. Could the minister tell us briefly what evidence there is, empirical or otherwise, to indicate that this additional measure to handle superannuation guarantee shortfalls is necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are saying that, as well as the ordinarily defined superannuation funds, it can be paid into an ADF. It is simply opening up an option for people. The superannuation guarantee shortfall component concept is already driven by the principal legislation. This is simply saying that, if this is paid into an ADF, it will be treated as if it were being paid into a superannuation fund. I assume that there will be people wishing to do that and, at the very least, it should not be the tax law that stops them. If they choose not to, it should be as a result of their decision about what they want to do with their superannuation funds, not because it is treated differently by the tax laws.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the legislation in need of amendment where an employee has a number of employers who are paying amounts into different funds, thereby increasing the employee's administration costs?</PARA></TALK.START>

If they fail to pay, they have to pay. What we are dealing with here is a change to the act to change the range of financial institutions into which the money belatedly paid can be placed. I think most of us would think it is obviously beneficial, and I do not think Senator Watson or Senator Short disagrees with that. There is no extra cost to the taxpayer.

<PARA>The subject matter of this amendment has been canvassed in the second reading debate and I will not detain the committee for long. I simply say that we were faced with a decision as to whether we should support the government in imposing excise on the beer that is produced by micro-breweries. The micro-breweries had made an inquiry of the Customs Service before they established their premises and were told that, if they followed a particular procedure, no excise would be levied. On the other hand, if micro-breweries proliferate&mdash;as they have done in Canada, where evidence shows that they have proliferated to the extent of producing three to four per cent of total beer production&mdash;there would be a substantial loss to government revenue of something in the order of $30 million in Australia. We are concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, the amendment seeks to impose an excise at the rate of 15 per cent which, together with wholesale sales tax, which I understand is consequential upon the imposition of excise, and the licence fees, which are also consequential, would bring the market price of beer produced in micro-breweries to approximately the level of the market price for beer produced by the manufacturing breweries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our intention in doing this is to fire a warning shot across the bows of micro-breweries and say that, while we certainly do not want to put them out of business, they cannot rely on a differential rate of excise&mdash;a preferential rate of excise, one should probably say&mdash;forever. I believe that this amendment is one that resolves to some extent the conflict of the two principles I outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to put on the record for the government that, first of all, we recognise the mathematics of the committee on this issue: with the opposition opposing full stop, if we voted against the Democrats' amendment we would end up with no excise at all. So, very reluctantly, we will support the Democrats' amendment at 15 per cent. I did put to the Democrats the proposition that it would be more effective around 30 per cent but, as I say, we recognise the numbers in this place on this particular measure. If we vote against it, we lose the lot; so 15 per cent is better than zero.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be reluctantly accepting the Democrats' amendment but, in doing so, I want to make a couple of points. We believe that it is necessary to establish the principle that beer produced at commercial premises&mdash;for example, brew-on-premises shops&mdash;is subject to the beer excise regime. The government, as I have just said, does not accept the principle espoused by the Democrats that there needs to be equivalence of retail prices. The market establishes the prices, not the government. Retail beer prices reflect significant differences between states, including different state licence fees. We know that recently the High Court made a ruling about those matters. The government believes that the overriding principle should be equity in the industry, that is, all beer brewed using commercial facilities should be subject to the excise regime. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we are emphasising is that, if it is brewed in a commercial enterprise which is operating as a commercial enterprise, it is in the marketplace. One can say that it is not for direct sale in the marketplace as a bottle of beer, but it is being brewed in a commercial enterprise that is operating at a profit. These micro-breweries would not be established on the basis that they were going to let individuals brew their beer and take it away and lose their money. The micro-breweries are being established to make a profit. That cannot be ignored. Although the bottles of beer produced are not actually sold, they are produced for people in the home-brewing market. But they use commercial premises and pay a fee for those premises to produce the beer. We believe that is a significant difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the assumption behind the Democrats' amendment, therefore, is entirely incorrect, that is, retail beer prices are the same between states; state licence fees on beer are the same between states; and sales tax is payable on the brew-on-premises shop price plus excise duty. Advice from the Taxation Office suggests otherwise. Excise should be a mechanism to equalise prices in the marketplace. Those are the reasons why we believe the assumption of the Democrats in the calculation of 15 per cent is incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's assessment is that the full rate of excise should be applied. However, given the concerns expressed, the government is prepared to modify its stance on the rate to ensure that BOP shops fall within the excise regime, even though it is at a level which is much less than we would like. I point out that, in our view, this does not solve the problem and that, in the future, the government may need to take further action. I want to emphasise this very strongly for the record. If the micro-breweries continue to develop in the marketplace and clearly start taking considerable market share, I warn this chamber, the parliament, and particularly the industry that we will seek to come back to the parliament and take measures to protect the excise revenue on beer overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the motivations for the government on this issue has been that we believe it is better to take early action before the industry develops&mdash;if it is going to develop, and it may develop&mdash;to such an extent that many more people would be employed and many more people would be investing if they saw that there was an advantage in the marketplace and if in a few years time, instead of having almost negligible production affecting the overall beer market, it was starting to run into many percentage points. I am told that in Canada the output of the micro-brewery structure that is operating in one of the provinces is now approaching eight or nine per cent of the consumption of beer. If we got to that sort of effect, I would have to ask this chamber to support a more difficult position, because we would have arguments from many more people claiming that they have already invested and from workers who are employed in these commercial micro-breweries. In our view, it would be a tougher decision to take then. I warn honourable senators and I warn the industry that, if it gets out of hand and starts getting into those sorts of percentage figures, we and the Australian Customs Service on behalf of the government will come back to take action to protect the excise revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that does concern us a little is that, if these micro-breweries start to grow and get an increased percentage of the consumption of beer, we suspect that the existing fully fledged commercial breweries that are operating in the marketplace and paying their full share of excise will say, `We want to get into this area to protect our market share as a commercial venture'. If that starts happening, that would be of concern to us because that would start rotting the revenue in this area of excise, which all honourable senators would recognise is a very valuable contribution to government revenues. It has been accepted since Federation that at the Commonwealth level our right to excise in this area is an important contribution to the national revenues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made those remarks because I think it is important to put the government's view on the record. I also want to suggest to Senator Spindler in particular that my advisers believe that there may be a better way to achieve the 15 per cent contained in his amendment than the way he has put it. We believe the amendment should read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6, page 4, after paragraph (a), insert the following paragraph:</PARA>

<PARA>The effect certainly is the same as Senator Spindler's amendment but it adopts the wording used in the definition of beer, therefore maintaining consistency in the use of the relevant definition. I table that amendment, which I think is better worded. It is not a secret plot to do over Senator Spindler's amendment; it just makes it, in our view, more consistent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take a moment to clarify an issue with the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht).

I understand that these tax imposts will increase the operating costs of that abattoir by some $65,000 and will affect the entire viability of this very important abattoir in central Australia. The company depends on Mereenie crude oil for the generation of its power.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is correct, as Senator Tambling said, that representations have been made to the government about the case of the abattoir near Alice Springs in Central Australia. The primary purpose of the legislation is to ensure that the users of fuel are taxed as the government intends. For example, where substitutes are used for diesel, they are to attract a diesel fuel duty rate. The government acknowledges that users of substitutes may therefore face an increase in prices. When a substitute is used for a purpose eligible under the diesel fuel rebate scheme, the rebate scheme will provide a rebate. Where there is no coverage of the rebate scheme, there is currently no relief from the tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to abattoirs, I am advised by Customs that there are appeals pending before the AAT on whether diesel used in association with these abattoirs is eligible for rebate. If the AAT decision is that the rebate is payable, abattoirs which use crude as a substitute for diesel will also qualify for rebate of the excise. I note, however, that the abattoir matter has already been raised with ministers and, rather than wait for the AAT decision, the government will consider whether liability for excise for particular uses or by particular users should be qualified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also advised by Customs that, in this particular case, the use of the crude oil could be as a substitute for fuel oil, which is taxed at a far lower rate than diesel. Customs will clarify this with the management of the abattoir. Taking the decision to tax crude oil condensate used as fuel, the government recognised the need to prescribe concessional treatment in certain circumstances. For example, use of crude oil or condensate as fuel for pipeline pumping and other activities related to the recovering production of crude petroleum has already been identified as being a circumstance for such concessional treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator Tambling that, on the issue of the particular abattoir, if we gave that a concessional rate we would have to give it to every abattoir in Australia because the excise has to be provided under the constitution; we cannot discriminate. That is something we are not willing to do at the moment because there are so many abattoirs across Australia. How many would have access to the advantage of Central Australia in having the nearby suitable crude oil? However, as I say, the matter is being appealed in the AAT. They may win the case in the AAT and, if they do, they will be eligible for the diesel fuel rebate, which will be of some considerable advantage. I trust that information is of use to Senator Tambling. </PARA>

I am glad the minister has indicated that this is a tax. The issue here is the same and needs to be similarly defeated. Our position is that, if certain categories of users have been deemed eligible for a rebate, it is not reasonable to expect these people to pay an administration charge to claim the rebate. We need to remember that, under the diesel fuel rebate scheme, farmers, miners and others are only claiming back the money they should not have been required to pay in the first place. </PARA>

Rural communities are doing it tough as it is. I have mentioned several times since coming into this place that many farmers have not seen a farm profit for several years now. To impose an additional tax on them at this time would be quite unreasonable and, as such, the Democrats oppose the introduction of an administration charge on our diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For many years now the diesel fuel rebate has been indexed twice a year, in February and August, or with each new excise increase. Under the arrangement proposed by this legislation, while the excise rate will continue to be indexed six-monthly in February and August, the rebate will be indexed only once a year. As it is, the system whereby the price of fuel will go up twice a year but the rebate will go up only once sounds bad enough; but, worse still, the government is attempting a sleight of hand, the finer detail of which has been missed by many.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable senators look closely at the wording of clauses 7 and 19, they will see that these clauses increase the rebate payable to a level that reflects the excise rate which applied immediately before the new rebate period. In lay terms, that means that the increases on the rebate paid to claimants will always be roughly a year behind the excise increases. The rebate will be indexed at the end of January or in early February each year, but the excise rate will be increased immediately after that and then again six months later. This indexation system is clearly unfair, and we oppose it. It is my belief that the change to the rebate scheme is one of a number of inequitable measures the government is putting up, across various portfolios, in an attempt to fund its irresponsible tax cuts.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When clause 5 comes before the committee, we will move the amendment. I just explain to the committee that, in drafting the child-care rebate legislation, there was a concern to ensure no children were described in a way as to disadvantage them or make them ineligible for the cash rebate received by their parents on their behalf. One of the unintended consequences of that drafting was to change the definition of `couple' and the definition of `family'. In the light of the concern raised, we have now amended clause 5 to change the definition of `family' to make it entirely consistent with the Social Security definition of `couple' and, consistent with that definition of Social Security, therefore to change the definition of `family' under this bill. I am advised that no child will be disadvantaged if we revert to the Social Security definition of a couple and, therefore, change the definition of `family' under this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to place on record that that was an unintended consequence of the drafting. It was a main concern of mine that we concentrate in this legislation on the rights of children&mdash;or parents on behalf of children&mdash;for cash rebate eligibility, and not use this legislation for a major debate about the definition of `family'. That is a distraction from this bill and properly belongs in the International Year of the Family. So as not to pre-empt that debate, and in the light of assurances that no child will be disadvantaged, I am giving notice of that amendment under clause 5, which I think will help with definitions under clause 4. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that explanation very difficult to understand. If the Minister for Family Services and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Crowley) is accurately reflecting the views of the department to the Senate, surely no officer who is competent would give to the minister an indication that the children for whom she is concerned&mdash;and for whom we are all concerned&mdash;would be disadvantaged. How could that be so? I think the minister should let the committee know what advice she received about that particular aspect. What clause in the legislation could a competent officer possibly construe as disadvantaging the parent of a child in that circumstance? The nature of this legislation is such that both parents must be in the paid work force&mdash;or seeking paid work&mdash;prior to the rebate being claimed. If there is a one-sex couple, one of whom has custody and control of a child, and if that one-sex couple is not regarded as a family, clearly the parent of that child would automatically be eligible to make a claim for a child rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any competent officer would be able to tell the minister that. I ask her to get up in this chamber and let me know and let the chamber know whether she did receive that advice.

Did the department give the minister the advice that such a parent of a child would be disadvantaged unless the one-sex relationship was regarded as a marriage-like relationship?</PARA>

I am assured now that no child will be disadvantaged, which is the point that Senator Harradine was making. I do not believe that there is really anything further to say on this matter. The words are clear. The unintended consequences of that drafting are now being dealt with. The advice is that no child will be disadvantaged.

Is the minister telling us that this legislation was prepared with the objective in mind that no child will be disadvantaged? She has to accept final responsibility, but is she seriously suggesting that the drafters of this legislation were so ignorant of the outcome of the legislation that they felt it was necessary to include in the definition of a marriage-like relationship a one-sex couple?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the minister to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for Wednesday, 24 November 1993, when I made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I may have misunderstood the minister. I would be really interested to hear what she has to say about that. If she is saying that, now, a marriage-like relationship is to be defined as a homosexual relationship or a lesbian relationship for the purposes of this legislation, so far as I can see, that is  the first time that a government minister has indicated that those relationships will be regarded as part of a definition of a family.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, that is what I said and that is what this legislation means.</PARA>
<PARA>Had I not raised the question on the last occasion, for the first time in legislation a homosexual or lesbian relationship would be regarded officially as a marriage-like relationship or as a family. That is a very serious matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister suggests now that that was an oversight, an unintended consequence. It was clearly not an unintended consequence. It was deliberately put in there. This is what is happening in various other areas as well. Only yesterday I was advised of taxpayers' money being spent by the department of health to create a supportive environment in the general community for men having sex with men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not here to question the interior dispositions of people. People are able to make their own decisions and they have to live with the consequences of those decisions. We in this chamber have a responsibility to uphold the fundamental group unit of society&mdash;the family. I ask the minister again: unless she was completely ignorant of the consequences, how can she say that this was not a deliberate measure? When I asked her the question last time, she consulted with the advisers before she made that comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley is also on record as saying that the family is self-defining. I think it is important on the eve of the year of the family for her to say that the government is not supportive of the definition of the family or a marriage-like relationship to include a homosexual or lesbian couple. The minister has a responsibility to get up here and say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempt to include these measures in the definition of family and marriage-like relationships is being done through the back door and it was attempted in this legislation. It went through the minister's department; it knew about it and her advisers knew about it. If they did not, they are blind, deaf, dumb and incompetent. They knew about it because they advised the minister when she asked them, after I asked the question. Is the minister telling us that they did not know that this occurs in no other legislation? Is she suggesting to this chamber that that was an oversight by them or by her? It is absolutely incredible that this is the first time this has occurred in legislation. The minister is saying, `Oh, it's an oversight', just because I happened to raise it in a question. As I said on that occasion, I was flabbergasted by her response because I knew it had no basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has gone through all of the measures that the minister's department adopts, it has gone through the House of Representatives and it has come to this chamber. It has only been stopped because I asked the question. That is probably because, generally speaking, people in this chamber have a great deal of respect for the competence of advisers and public servants. But on this occasion, clearly the minister's competence is in question. If she wants to do these things, she should do them out in the open and make it very clear what she, as Minister for Family Services, means. In the International Year of the Family does she intend to include one sex relationships as part of the definition of a marriage-like relationship or a family?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) will not be supporting the government amendment to exclude same-sex couples from the definition of a family for the purpose of the Childcare Rebate Bill.

I am also aware of the danger of setting a precedent that may work to disadvantage lesbian and gay people. However, the Greens (WA) cannot support an amendment that specifically excludes lesbian and gay relationships from the definition of a family and ignores the reality of family life in some sections of our diverse community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public and legal recognition of same-sex relationships is long overdue. The lack of recognition is in breach of international human rights obligations and contrary to the government's ongoing commitment to equality for lesbian and gay people. At the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Australia's United Nations Ambassador and head of the Australian delegation, Penny Wensley, highlighted sexual preference as an area of discrimination yet to receive serious and detailed attention in the United Nations. Ambassador Wensley said that she hoped the conference would mark the start of a process of discussion and dialogue aimed at ensuring that individuals are not discriminated against on the grounds of sexual preference and that Australia supported such moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has demonstrated in this speech its commitment to equal rights for lesbian and gay people, lifting the ban on lesbian and gay men in the armed forces, and its support for the Tasmanian gay law reform case currently before the United Nations Human Rights Committee. I understand there have been representations to the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, and the Minister for Justice, Mr Kerr, calling for an Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry into equality before the law for lesbian and gay people. I urge the government to take advantage of the opportunity of having this debate raised in this place to demonstrate its commitment to equality for these people by instigating measures such as the law reform inquiry. This issue requires immediate and serious attention in its own forum. It is essential to help protect lesbian and gay people from inadvertent or deliberate discrimination now and in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not getting too many responses from the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). She is silent, because she knows as well as I do what was on here: this was a try-on. It was a try-on and she knows it. It was an absolute try-on. The reason that I say that it was a try-on is that the minister knew what she was about. In her speech on 23 November at the launch of the ABS's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Families</EMPHASIS>, she actually stated that at the time of the survey the ABS did not include same-sex families&mdash;the minister's words. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the survey the ABS did not include same-sex families in their definition of family. I am pleased to say that the ABS has recently reviewed this policy and, in future, homosexual couples will be included in surveys.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the minister said on 23 November, and it is on record that that is what her view is. Then on 24 November, the next day, she comes in here with a piece of legislation which she then says has a marriage-like relationship which includes homosexual and lesbian couples. I think the minister has a good deal to answer for in respect of that. She needs to answer the questions that I have raised and the question that Senator Herron has just raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS had certain advice from some people about that. Some of that advice came from the Office of the Status of Women. I would like to know what the advice was from the office in respect of that particular matter. The ABS is quite entitled, for statistical purposes, to look and see who is about. I assume there is no objection, in statistical terms, to looking at who is in a household, whether they be called household units or other things. It is a different matter to define a family to include homosexual and lesbian couples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a question of sexual preference, as Senator Margetts raised. Frankly, it is probably quite the contrary in respect of this particular bill. Senator Margetts's opposition to the government's amendment would possibly mean that the parent of a child in a homosexual relationship would not be eligible for a child-care rebate. So it is not a question of discrimination on that ground at all. It is clearly a question of the definition of a family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister is saying, on the eve of the International Year of the Family, that same sex couples are able to be defined as a family. That is what she is saying. That is what she said at the release of the ABS survey and that is what is being said in this bill. Is Senator Crowley suggesting to this committee that she did not do that deliberately, that that was just an unintended consequence because of her desire to ensure that there was no disadvantage to particular children? We have shown that there is no disadvantage to children in this particular respect. Senator Crowley has absolutely no argument and no excuse for what she has done, other than to declare that she was completely ignorant of the operation of this measure, as were her departmental advisers from whom she got advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have made my position quite clear. It seems that Senator Harradine is still suggesting that I am trying to use this bill as an underhanded or sneaky piece of legislation to define a family.

That is why this legislation has been amended to deal with the matter of cash rebate. We are not trying to use it as a carriage for the debate about the family.

As we have had some of the debate in here already, some three or four hours as part of the industrial relations legislation, we believe this would be a good opportunity to continue this debate. I also acknowledge what Senator Harradine has been saying, that by the government's amendment, which I understand is to the next clause, same-sex couples will indeed be advantaged. As Senator Harradine has reminded us, the definition in the bill is that both parents have to be working, studying or in training before that rebate can be paid. If same-sex couples are no longer going to be treated as a family, only one of them, the parent actually has to be studying or training for that rebate to be able to be claimed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Similar to the action just taken by Senator Archer, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a non-contentious second reading speech relating to the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill 1993 and a related bill. I have discussed this with the government whip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill will implement a per premises charge on domestic meat establishments where the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is responsible for domestic meat inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand this is the first of a series of bills to restructure AQIS&mdash;the Commonwealth's meat inspection agency&mdash;as well as shed some 750 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, AQIS employs about 2600 Commonwealth and State staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When this Bill was introduced the second reading speech referred to a three tier system of charging for inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;There was to be a premises charge&mdash;which this Bill refers to;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;There was to be an inspector charge&mdash;which is the current system; and&mdash;There was to be a throughput charge of about 47 cents per beast for every animal going through the meatworks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Federal Coalition supports the shedding of surplus jobs, we did not believe the proposed method would deliver adequate savings in meat inspection costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also believed the throughput charge would discriminate against companies undertaking quality control measures in order to reduce inspection charges, by charging them an inspection fee per beast when in fact they did not have any AQIS inspectors on the premises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view it would have been a disincentive for companies to undertake much needed increases in productivity and more responsibility for their own quality control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that time we said the Federal Coalition would not support this Bill unless the Federal Government withdrew its proposals for this throughput charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also sent this Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and following public hearings the Committee noted:-</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the unanimous view of industry is that there should not be a three tier structure involving a throughput charge;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. a majority of industry organisations, but not the Meat and Allied Trades Federation (MATFA), support a two tier charging arrangement;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. AQIS will continue discussions with MATFA "with the objective of accommodating specific concerns with the two tier structure";</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the charging model has been expanded from 12 to 18 categories;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the concerns of establishments which have multiple operators in a single premises have been addressed; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. consultative and review mechanisms will be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of our efforts, the Government has agreed to drop the throughput charge and has been discussing a two tier system with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the Meat and Allied Trades Federation, with the exception of its Victorian Branch, and farmer organisations, with the exception of the Victorian Farmers' Federation, have now given support for a meat premises charge. However there are still some concerns that individual operators might be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of these developments the Coalition will now support this Bill for a Domestic Meat Premises Charge but we will closely watch the regulations which the Government needs to establish the amount of this charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these charges are seen to discriminate against or cause unnecessary hardship to individual operators we will seek Democrat support to move to disallow these charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to ensure that these premises charges are not just a way of hiding the real cost of inspection and that operators are not paying for anything other than the service provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real value in a single per inspector charge is that industry can readily calculate the add-on costs which can be high and embarrassing, particularly to inspectors in the field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today a meat inspector is paid around $32,000, allowing for overtime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, they are charged out to abattoirs at a rate in excess of $70,000 which only goes to prove there are too many people and too much money is being wasted in middle and top management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has promised to reduce the per inspector charge down to about $59,000. However there is little point to a per inspector charge being reduced if the premises charge negates all of the gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government must ensure that the total cost of inspection goes down whether it is in one or two tiers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Shadow Minister for Primary Industry picked up on that point when he told the other place:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . there is really something lacking in the morality of the situation where producers effectively have to pay the redundancy packages involved when there have been meat inspectors employed in the last few years . . . when the service must have known that it was already overstaffed.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government's inability to sort out the staffing levels and work practices is at the heart of the problem. If these patterns were repeated in private enterprise the result would be bankruptcy."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a long time, we had about 63 meat inspectors stationed in towns and other places around Australia where there were no abattoirs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the Meat Research Corporation looked at the efficacy of inspectors in Australia, Argentina and New Zealand and other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It found that, in America, an inspector would get through 300 head a shift.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia, 79 head. Mind you, that figure reflects erratic plant throughput, inefficiencies of work practices on the slaughter floor and the tally system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also have too many inspectors on the floor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 900 inspectors are in employment but there are another 600 on the payroll, as well as hundreds in offices, many of whom are surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There must be greater progress towards quality assurance programs so that companies become more responsible for their own inspection, just as there must be a concerted effort to straighten out work practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of background, the Government promised in this year's Budget to reform AQIS. I believe this was prompted by the Federal Coalition's policy to cut AQIS by $20 million in total outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mind you, when Fightback was launched, the Government said it was not possible to reduce AQIS's costs. It has now decided that it is possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also wants to encourage the Australian industry to take more responsibility for quality assurance. That has been long-standing Coalition policy and we are pleased to see the Government pick it up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's original plan for a three tier system did not offer sufficient encouragement or reward for processors to undertake their own quality assurance, and for this reason we are pleased that the Government has agreed to make the changes suggested by the Coalition and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After all, there is no need to have inspectors in domestic works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inspection of these works can be conducted on a "flying squad" basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the three-tier approach would have ensured that even when a meatworks met all the quality assurance requirements and no longer had inspectors in the plant, it would still have to pay an amount per beast for inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Coalition supports the downsizing of AQIS because it is in the long-term interests of the meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the Government's assurances that it will not introduce a throughput charge and will ensure that its premises charge will not unfairly disadvantage any particular operator the Coalition will now support this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However we give notice that we will pay close attention to the regulations when they are formulated to ensure that any charges for domestic meat premises do not add to the inspection cost burden and that the Government is indeed working to reduce the overall cost to industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in the debate on the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill and the Export Inspection Charges Laws Amendment Bill because the bills received a lot of attention from the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. I think the committee achieved quite a lot with the legislation. It passed through the House of Representatives with little time for consideration and certainly no time for consultation. I am not going to let it go through this place without having a few words to say about it. It is good to see that the chairman of the rural and regional affairs committee, Senator Burns, is in the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the structure of the legislation, the coalition opposed the bills. When the bills arrived in the Senate, they were referred to the Senate rural and regional affairs committee, with an original reporting date of 22 November, which was extended until 7 December to allow due processes of consultation to occur. Modestly, I have to say that the rural and regional affairs committee continues to demonstrate how committees to which bills are referred should function. We have demonstrated repeatedly, on matters such as resource security legislation, the deer industry and now the meat processing industry, that consultation with industry very often brings about legislation with which most people become happy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have legislation now before the parliament that is, by and large, understood and accepted by industry to a great degree. Some reservations remain, and I will deal with those shortly, but what is in place now, I think, is going in the right direction. Additionally, we now have a federal government department that has benefited from the consultative processes and has become more understanding of the industry and more accessible to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with the bills, the committee invited several groups and leading processors to address it. The committee also took the opportunity, which it often does, to visit and inspect processing works around the country. In this instance we went down to Geelong to appreciate the issues relevant to the bills. During the course of those discussions, it became apparent that there was considerable disquiet within the industry. The main areas of concern were the proposed three-tier charging regime, the throughput charge, the equity of the premises charge, the effective abandoning of the three-tier principle on future charging structures, and the level of consultation by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Overriding all of this was the stated aim of AQIS to reform its processes and become more efficient and effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were considerable doubts expressed&mdash;I certainly repeated them often&mdash;as to whether this legislation would deliver the desired reforms, whether it was not better to throw away the legislation and start again or stay with the single per-inspector charge, as is the case now, and make sure that those charges come down by reforming the quantity of work done, getting a better quality assurance program and that sort of thing. We found numerous examples of a government department that was remote from the industry it was purportedly trying to serve, of correspondence never answered, of concerns never addressed. This legislation was a result of that lack of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation essentially implements a premises charge on domestic meatworks where AQIS inspectors are employed. However, the system intended to operate post-passage of this bill was a three-tiered charging regime made up of a current charge per inspector per unit of time, a fixed annual charge per premises and a throughput or volume charge. Whilst these bills address only the second point&mdash;that of a fixed annual charge or a premises charge&mdash;it was not appropriate for the rural and regional affairs committee to take it in isolation of industry's other concerns about present and proposed cost structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) foreshadowed further legislation to cover a throughput charge, a fixed price per beast process charge. To those outside the rural industry, the principal matters dealt with in the legislation are complex. I do not believe time would be well spent in explaining the cost structure of the meat processing industry. Suffice to say that the proposed regulations were flawed and showed considerable discrimination or unintended consequences for some companies. The proposals were particularly obnoxious to the Cattle Council of Australia, which argued that the concept of a three-tier charge had already been put out to industry in 1992 and was rejected at that time. It felt that the industry did not want such an arrangement and that AQIS was merely trying to force processors into costings they did not need to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cattle Council was of a view that charges should accurately reflect costings but that the proposed legislation was inflated to allow fat in the present AQIS administration. The Cattle Council executive took their concerns to a full Cattle Council meeting at Wagga during the AMLC annual general meeting and at that meeting resolved to support a two-tiered charging system conditional upon the capping of the per meat inspector charge at a level that reflects the actual cost associated with the inspector's time and service, and the broadening of the categories applying for the establishment charge such that effort by innovative operators to adopt quality assurance programs and various cutting edge technologies were accommodated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that meeting, AQIS convened a meeting with the Cattle Council, various meat processing groups and industry representatives at which several options were canvassed. In effect, the result was a choice of a two-tiered charging regime with 12 categories or the adoption of a two-tiered regime involving 18 categories with varying timetables. The increase in category option provided a more accurate assessment of costs. For example, an abattoir with an export licence but low-volume exports would pay something like $6,190 in registration charges this year, moving to $10,000-odd in 1997-98, while one licensed for export with US and EC listing would pay $49,516 in 1994 and $82,527 by 1997-98. This has by and large been accepted as a more equitable cost carve-up. Under the original proposed charging regime there were only eight categories and numerous abattoirs would have been unfairly charged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister had argued in his second reading speech that he was seeking a system that had the objectives of efficiency, equity, consistency, transparency and simplicity. The Cattle Council, amongst others, argued that the legislation was not based on equity, it was not transparent, and it would not produce the desired efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One processor particularly disadvantaged was one close to my home&mdash;Gunnedah abattoir. Gunnedah abattoir would have been hard hit by the new rules and yet, prior to the committee hearings, had been denied any opportunity to put its case. Ray Grout, the abattoir manager, appeared before the committee and argued that the new charges would cost his abattoir dearly. He outlined a frightening scenario where his works would be charged on a multiple of levels simply because no-one had thought about consulting him. It would have possibly put his works out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gunnedah abattoir has separately registered lease portions within a single premises. Its situation was one completely overlooked by AQIS when drafting the charging models. By appearing before the committee and in subsequent discussions with AQIS, Gunnedah abattoir was able to have the charging levels more accurately reflect the true position in the market. That would not have happened had the legislation been processed through this chamber as so many other pieces of legislation are. This government is poor at consultation. AQIS has a very poor track record in communication with industry. That is an appalling&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator BROWNHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct, Senator Panizza. That is an appalling situation when one considers that it has just increased its consultancy cost by over 100 per cent in the last 12 months. Nevertheless, in drafting this legislation, the draftsman failed to take into consideration the myriad of Gunnedah abattoirs. The department has not done its homework properly and, while the committee endorsed the legislation and recommended no amendment to it, it did so in the knowledge that there had already been considerable change by the department in its fee structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other areas which need to be canvassed. The first is the move within the industry to a quality assurance scheme. Under the original arrangement there would have been little incentive for works to have moved towards quality assurance. The preferred 18-level option now supported will preserve the incentive for quality assurance inspection arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another benefit to come from the industry consultations was an undertaking by AQIS to reconvene a charging review committee to act as a forum between industry and AQIS to assess the progress of the two-tiered charging mechanism and to review AQIS cost structures and operations in the period up to 30 June 1995. After 1995, new charges will be applied based on what the review committee determines. The review committee will also review arrangements for establishments with separately leased portions during the next two years transition period. That wants to be qualified, and we might have to have a talk about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However&mdash;and I make this a clear warning to AQIS&mdash;the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs in its report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It places on record its intention to monitor the reforms of AQIS and, if necessary, seek a specific reference on this matter from the Senate if it does not go ahead with its cost saving structures.</PARA>
<PARA>I can assure AQIS that I will be monitoring very closely its costings and efforts to reform and the timetable for those efficiencies to which it aspires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have some residual reservations about this legislation. Whilst sound in intent, it is still perhaps only tinkering at the edges of reform. Certainly not everyone in the industry is happy. Let us look at what the reforms really are. In the year 1992-93, the actual revenue coming in to AQIS is $80-odd million; by 1997-98, it is going to be about $70-odd million&mdash;a saving of $10 million. There are people who are in category 15, for example, which is export boning, European Community listed and export slaughter, no US or EC listing, and in that category their charges per premises go from $38,000-odd to $60,000-odd. So there is a bit of an extra charge for some of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the Victorian Farmers Federation contacted my office, claiming there had not been the formal consultation process required and the Victorian domestic meat industry was opposed to the bills even with the changes. The Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia echoed those objections. Both groups want a single per inspector charge to remain, claiming it would encourage the industry to move towards quality assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took evidence on the issue. Clearly there is an argument to be made that, under the present cost structure, smaller, non-continuous works are not paying their fair share of inspection costs. That needed to change if that were the case. However, the VFF says that it should be possible for AQIS to incorporate as many charges in the per inspectorate rate as are necessary for AQIS fully to recover the cost of providing the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Domestic meat processors are also opposed to a premises charge, arguing it will be another deterrent to the domestic industry embracing quality assurance programs. A letter from the VFF said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Domestic meat processors . . . believe the introduction of a premises or registration charge as a component of AQIS's fee-for-service charging will be a deterrent to widespread uptake of domestic quality assurance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has been planning quality assurance process for at least two years in the belief that efficient users of AQIS's services were to be fully rewarded.</PARA>
<PARA>The Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Industry has been planning quality assurance approaches for at least two years in the belief that efficient users of AQIS' services were to be fully rewarded. The Government has openly encouraged industry to give priority to quality assurance to offset increased inspection costs, and the industry has responded by seeking to install quality systems which improve . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two major domestic quality assurance ventures have commenced on the basis that the Government will safeguard industry's large investment through its incentive policy of single per-inspector charging.</PARA>
<PARA>The Refrigerated Warehouses and Transport Association of Australia remains opposed, arguing that the new charges will result in the deregistration of approximately eight export cold store establishments, or 50 per cent of those currently registered. It argues that, if cold stores are to be categorised, there should be only two categories: those with and those without quality assurance programs in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have reservations about how committed the department is to adherence to a true user-pays system. However, I am prepared to give the department the benefit of the doubt. It has made genuine attempts to accommodate the concerns of industry and has listened, admittedly belatedly and perhaps a little unwillingly at times, to industry and politicians. The legislation, while not technically amended, is better structured. Its implications and its outcomes have been improved because of the Senate committee's process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already outlined, not all sectors of the industry are happy. There is an argument to suggest that these fees will have the net effect of forcing the smaller operators out of the market. If it is because in the past they have not carried the fair share of the cost of inspection, then so be it. If they are forced out&mdash;and maybe a lot will be in your state of Victoria, Mr Acting Deputy President, because they have been in contact with me a lot about this matter&mdash;because of unfair, inflated costings by government inspection services, then this parliament has a duty to intervene. I have already flagged my interest in ensuring that AQIS delivers quality at an affordable price. It is a challenge for AQIS, but one I am confident that AQIS is capable of meeting provided it has the appropriate cost consciousness. It needs to establish that and this legislation provides an opportunity for it to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with many of the things that Senator Brownhill said in speaking to the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Bill and the Export Inspection Charges Laws Amendment Bill. One of the things that was very positive and a plus was the fact that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs on this occasion had some time in which to hold the inquiry, and it was helpful to talk with the people who could make known to us an objective and collective point of view. Also, the minister, his advisers and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service were still in a fluid position in relation to discussions and consultations with the processors, so there was nothing so concrete that it could not be altered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though it had been flagged that the three-tier system was a possibility, it became obvious very quickly to the members of the committee, and it was certainly the view of many of the witnesses that talked to us, that the third tier was not a goer but that two tiers were. The two-tier system was put into place because many of the processors wanted that to occur. The bigger processors particularly felt that the amount of money they were paying into the system was greater than it should have been and that there were smaller processors and medium processors who really were not making the correct contribution. So they themselves wanted the two-tier system to sort out that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in the process there seemed not to be sufficient flexibility and people could be somewhat discriminated against. But again the discussions went on and we were able to get a number of further categories that certainly satisfied that problem. It is clear that AQIS has got an attitude to reducing the number of inspectors. It talks about 25 per cent. In my view, in the long term that will reduce quite considerably the cost to processors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the long-term solution is the quality assurance program. I was pleased, as the chairman of the committee, along with other members, to look at at least one domestic shed, Herds, which had gone a long way along that path. It must be said that AQIS has played a fairly important role in this regard by setting up the sorts of programs and training that are required and also, as an organisation, to carry out the necessary auditing work. So I really believe that it was a good inquiry. I believe that the outcome was fair and reasonable in the circumstances although, as I always say about any legislation, not perfect. I think that we are now on the right track and I, with Senator Brownhill and other people, will make certain that that track is a straight one, that it goes down the line and that it will deliver benefits not only to the meat processors but to the community generally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are addressing two bills today, and I turn my attention, firstly, to the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1993. Because of the international nature of the shipping industry, it is obvious that pollution of the marine environment is an important international matter. Marine pollution is a current issue, as there is an amount of community concern that unseaworthy ships may discharge pollutants into the marine environment, especially as they pass the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is responsible for pollution from ships in Australia's high seas, and it passed legislation in 1960 to minimise the incidence of oil tanker accidents. Since then, Australia has ratified a number of conventions relating to accidental sea pollution and dumping, and this bill is ratifying the latest convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose the bill, which amends the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 in line with the Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution of the South Pacific Region by Dumping. This is one of two protocols to the South Pacific region environment protection convention. Australia has already ratified the other protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protocol is a regional agreement, consistent with the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, known as the London Convention 1972, which Australia accepted in its sea dumping act of 1972. The bill needs to be changed minimally to comply with the protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One amendment extends geographical coverage of the sea dumping act to cover both the Australian fishing zone and the continental shelf where the two do not coincide. The other adds the dumping of organophosphorous compounds to the existing list of banned substances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact is minimal. The practical effect of applying the SPREP dumping protocol to all Australian waters and the continental shelf is that it will be an offence to dump organophosphorous compounds in the Indian and Southern oceans as well as the SPREP convention area. As Tasmania is the only state with a separate sea dumping act, it has agreed to bring it into line with the federal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the second piece of legislation that we are considering and refer some comments specifically to the Environment Protection (Alligators Rivers Region) Amendment Bill, which incorporates the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth protection agency. The Office of the Supervising Scientist was established in 1978 to research the effect of uranium mining on the Alligator Rivers Region in the Northern Territory. Naturally, I would take a very close and personal interest in this agency. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1977, following consideration of the recommendations of the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry, or what is commonly known as the Fox commission, the Commonwealth decided to allow uranium mining operations in the Alligator Rivers Region. As a prerequisite, the Fox commission recommended the establishment of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and envisaged it to be a small research unit which would establish a base from which conclusions in respect of environmental damage can later be drawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ranger uranium mine has been operating since 1980 and is regarded as one of the most tightly regulated and heavily scrutinised mines in the world. Even with such close monitoring, no significant environmental detriment has been detected outside the lease area. Over the past 13 years, the Office of Supervising Scientist operations have cost more than $100 million in 1993 dollars. There is certainly considerable scope for achieving economies, both of scale and of improved efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill aims for more efficient operations of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and for improved working relationships with the relevant organisations. However, the operators of the mine, Energy Resources of Australia Ltd, naturally have a number of concerns with regard to the legislation. They have, in their normal and routine contact with me, advised me of some of the issues that have arisen and of their consideration and their concerns with these particular proposals&mdash;certainly, the requirement by ERA to pay the equivalent of the export levy but under a different name. This would ensure the ongoing financial support for the OSS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus for research would be lost if the senior scientific review panel, as originally proposed, was made subservient to a pseudo-coordinating committee which would simply reintroduce the political agenda in the setting of research priorities, direction and appropriate research, and a lack of acceptance that ERA needs the relief of removing the export levy to allow it to compete fairly in the international uranium market. ERA is prepared to commit a fair-shared annual research budget of about $5 million per year to achieve well directed and timely environmental research work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the company is opposed to any executive role for the consultative committee, and the technical committee should provide advice directly to the Commonwealth and supervising authorities and should have a membership made up of only the relevant government authorities and mining companies. ERA is supportive of the existing proposals to revise the working arrangements between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory to effectively use the existing regulatory powers and is strongly opposed to any amendments providing regulatory powers to the Office of the Supervising Scientist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has initiated a formal review of research requirements in the Alligator Rivers region, and the issue of the uranium export levy and more efficient funding arrangements should be determined following that review. I also point to the important involvement of the Northern Territory Department of Mines and Energy in this particular process. As many honourable senators are aware, a number of us feel that the relationship between the Northern Territory government agencies, the Northern Territory University, the Department of Mines and Energy and the conservation commission of the Northern Territory should be embraced in this important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the bill fails to address is the reduction of unnecessary cost and duplication. Certainly, the bill does not reduce OSS staff and operations to the levels proposed initially by Fox. Ranger will continue to be one of the most tightly regulated and heavily scrutinised mines in the world. The Office of the Supervising Scientist will continue to cost one hundred times more than Fox ever envisaged. It will be interesting also to watch any change in roles that the OSS has had exclusively with regard to the operation in the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory and to see whether other mines that may well be developed in the future, particularly at Roxby Downs in South Australia, are also embraced in these proposals. They will need careful monitoring, of course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly on both the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1993 and the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Bill 1993. Firstly, the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1993 is supported by the Greens, although we would strongly urge that the Australian government make representations to the other members of the South Pacific regional environment program to upgrade the SPREP protocol for the prevention of pollution of the South Pacific region by dumping.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upgrade should be to bring it into line with recent changes to the London convention. At the most recent meeting of the consultative meeting to the London convention, the contracting parties agreed to ban all forms of nuclear waste and industrial waste. We hope that a similar ban will be negotiated with the South Pacific regional environment program protocol as soon as possible. One important implication of this bill is that it should give the Australian government the power and, hopefully, the will to ban Pasminco Metals-EZ from dumping jarosite waste at sea off the coast of Tasmania. The operation of Pasminco's zinc smelter and the disposal of the waste from its smelter has been a longstanding blight on Australia's commitment to environmental protection within the South Pacific. It certainly makes a mockery of our participation in the regional environment program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every 18 hours a ship dumps 400 tonnes of jarosite off the continental shelf of Tasmania with the approval of the Labor government. This has got to stop. But the problem of Pasminco smelter does not just relate to the dumping of jarosite. The Resource Assessment Commission's final report on the coastal zone introduced into the Senate last week makes specific reference to the heavy metal contamination of the Derwent River as a result of the Pasminco smelter. It refers to the significant levels of heavy metals including cadmium, lead, mercury, copper and zinc. The level of these heavy metals is above ANZECC guidelines for aquatic protection. In summary, we hope that the government will take serious note of this bill and take immediate action to stop all forms of waste dumping at sea, in particular to stop the internationally embarrassing actions of Pasminco as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the second bill, the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Bill 1993. The purpose of this bill is to restructure the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Alligator Rivers Region Research Institute and to incorporate them into the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. At the outset, we would like to express our concerns about the lack of consultation on this matter with the environment groups in particular. The OSS is, after all, required to monitor the environmental impact of mining in the Alligator Rivers region and it would seem logical to have consulted widely with national and state environment groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, inclusion of the OSS under the control of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency is not of great concern. The administrative streamlining that results from such a change is obviously a cost-effective solution. Our concerns relate to the basis of the committees that will provide advice to this office. There is currently one coordinated committee and it is proposed that it be split into two separate committees. Our concern is that the environment and Aboriginal groups that are represented on the consultative committee will effectively be marginalised by this split. I trust that the government will ensure that this does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of broadening the scope of work carried out by the OSS is laudable, given the need for the monitoring of the environmental impact of mining operations, especially uranium mining, everywhere in Australia. Our concern is that this increase in workload will be carried out at the expense of the current work being done in the Alligator Rivers region. I trust that the government will consider an increase in funding for the OSS in the 1994 Budget. I also wish to note in closing that the Greens (WA) will be supporting all the amendments proposed by the Australian Democrats as we feel that they address some of our main concerns in relation to this bill. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate is debating the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Bill 1993 and the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will deal with the Alligator Rivers Region Bill first. This Bill is designed to achieve a number of goals:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to abolish the Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region and replace it with two committees&mdash;a Technical Committee and a Consultative Committee;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to allow the Supervising Scientist for the Alligator Rivers Region to advise the Minister for Environment on matters outside the Alligator Rivers Region;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to integrate the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to allow the Alligator Rivers Research Institute to undertake contract work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats have been involved in negotiations with the Minister's office for some time over this Bill. We are pleased with the amendment to allow the Supervising Scientist to report to the Minister on matters outside the Region. This will include the Roxby Downs mine in South Australia. However, I made a request of the Minister that Roxby Downs should be subject to monitoring by the OSS or CEPA. The Minister informed me that the South Australian Government is particularly unwilling to co-operate in this matter. I then put to the Minister that the Commonwealth had powers it could use to impose monitoring upon the Roxby Downs mine. That this was again refused is symptomatic of the fact that this Government refuses to use its Federal powers to protect the environment, whilst being prepared to use those same powers in relation to other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main section of the Bill deals with the replacement of the Co-ordinating Committee with the Technical and Consultative Committees. The Bills Digest noted that the reason for the change is to refine mechanisms for consulting with key stakeholders. I believe this is a sanitised explanation for the reasons for the abolition of the Co-ordinating Committee. The real reason is that the mining industry, notably Energy Resources Australia, has never been happy with an environment representative being included in the Co-ordinating Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to note that a former Federal Minister for the Environment wrote to the Managing Director of Koongarra Mines on 26 February 1986. In that telex he referred to a former environment representative Ms Lyn Allen. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Your comments regarding Ms Allen' appointment as denigrating the Committee [. . . ] could be misconstrued as the banker not wishing the auditor to look closely in his books.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister went on to say that the contributions of the environment representatives have been valuable and constructive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear from these comments that the mining industry has never approved of community representation on the Co-ordinating Committee. The mining industry has acted in a belligerent and obstructionist manner on the Co-ordinating Committee. I understand that the industry would refuse to co-operate if an environment representative was included on the Technical Committee. It seems as if the mining industry is holding the Government to ransom on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats remain opposed to the splitting of the Co-ordinating Committee. I proposed to the Minister that the Committee be retained but that the Chair of the Committee should be made an independent decision. I believe this would be an appropriate response to a Committee that all agree is not functioning optimally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reform proposal was put forward in the Review of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, known as the Taylor Report. However, Cabinet decided against this course of action. I have therefore proposed a number of amendments which accept the two committee system but attempt to improve the functioning and information flow between the committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several of these amendments relate to the membership of the committees. It is entirely appropriate that community representatives be included on both the Consultative Committee and the Technical Committee. Obviously community representatives on the Technical Committee would need scientific or technical qualifications, but these are not hard to find in the environment movement. Opposition to environment representation on the Technical Committee by the mining industry is nothing but pure obstructionism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment Bill 1993 implements the Protocol for the Prevention of Pollution of the South Pacific Region by Dumping, usually referred to as the SPREP Dumping Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats strongly support this legislation which will outlaw the dumping of certain environmentally noxious substances listed in Annex One of the Protocol. These include such substances as organohalogen compounds, mercury and cadmium, persistent plastics, crude oil and its waste, materials produced for biological and chemical warfare and organophosphorous compounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the provisions within the SPREP Dumping Protocol are consistent with those of the international Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, known as the London Dumping Convention of 1972.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I noticed that the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill states that because the provisions are consistent, Australia would have little difficulty in meeting the obligations under this Protocol. I find that statement rather perplexing given the recent decision by the parties to the London Dumping Convention not to approve an Australian application for an exemption to the 1995 phase out date for dumping at sea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AustraLian Government had succumbed to the cries of Pasminco-EZ&mdash;a company which operates a zinc refinery near Hobart. Pasminco has been dumping jarosite into the ocean, about 130 nautical miles south of Tasmania, over the edge of the continental shelf where the water is about 1,000 fathoms deep. Jarosite is a toxic mixture of iron, sulphur, ammonia and smaller amounts of heavy metals including zinc, cadmium, lead mercury, arsenic and copper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every 18 hours Pasminco sends out a ship called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anson</EMPHASIS> and dumps about 400 tonnes of this toxic cocktail into the ocean. The company has been doing this since 1973. The licence allows Pasminco to dump up to 250,000 tonnes of jarosite a year. At a constant rate over 20 years since 1973, that would make a total of five million tonnes of dumped jarosite. Yet the company claims that it is not causing any environmental damage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And the licence costs the company only $5,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the dumping of jarosite at sea by Pasminco is one of the last remaining instances of major jarosite ocean dumping in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another factor in the equation is that the area where Pasminco dumps jarosite is fished for orange roughy and trevally. Yet there is insufficient information available to know what the impacts of the dumping are on marine life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the London Dumping Convention, signatory countries are required to stop ocean dumping of scheduled wastes. It was recently reported in the media that the Australian Government had applied for an exemption to the 1995 phase out date, but the parties to the Convention refused to grant the exemption. This was acutely embarrassing to the Australian Government. It was the only time a country had sought an exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should never have agreed to seek the exemption in the first place. Pasminco refused to comment to the media, although I understand that the company is working with the Commonwealth EPA to develop alternatives to sea dumping that will be in place by 1995. This is what the Australian Government should have required of Pasminco in the first place. It took the international community to tell Pasminco to stop dumping, something the Australian Government could not bring itself to do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why I find it somewhat perplexing when the Government says it will have no difficulty in meeting the obligations under the SPREP Dumping Protocol. Is the Government saying that it is confident that solutions to Pasminco's dumping off the Tasmanian continental shelf can be found in the near future. If so, why did the Government seek an exemption? Or is the Government misleading the public in relation to its assurance that the 1995 phase out date can be met. I would hope that the Minister can provide some clarification on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other issue I want to raise in the remaining time is the problem of sea dumping of ballast water. As the Senate would be aware, the dumping of ballast water prior to taking on cargo poses a major threat to the health of our costal waters, to marine life, the fishing industry and to human health as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stress the human health aspects because it was revealed at an International Maritime Association meeting last year that cholera had been found in the ballast water of five ships that had visited South American ports. This prompted Australian officials to test ballast water for any evidence of cholera. I have been informed by AQIS that testing of ballast water for cholera is still being carried out, however, no sign of cholera has been found. The AQIS official told me that a research project is likely to get underway in the new year which will examine whether the cholera organism can survive on the long voyage to Australia, the chances of it surviving in a marine environment, and the chances of it being transferred to humans. Depending on the results of the research, a response strategy may be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although we are lucky that cholera has not found its way to Australia via ballast water, nevertheless ballast water has been responsible for a number of severe environmental impacts along Australia's coastline. Tasmanian Senators would be aware of the problem of the Japanese seastar around south-eastern Tasmania and the exotic undaria seaweed which has blanketed the ocean floor in an area 16 kilometres long and two kilometres wide off the Tasmanian coast. AQIS has deemed the seaweed impossible to eradicate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government developed guidelines for the control of ballast water in 1991. However, I note that in the recently tabled final report by the Resource Assessment Commission on the Coastal Zone, the Commissioners note that not all state government have adopted those guidelines and that this is impeding the implementation of effective arrangements for handling ballast water. The report recommends that guidelines for handling ballast water by AQIS be adopted by all Australian governments having responsibility for shipping and ports administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Federal Government has recently released a discussion paper on tougher new guidelines on the discharge of ballast water.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I hope that the Australian Government gives serious consideration to the development of an international protocol dealing with the dumping of ballast water. I envisage that the appropriate mechanism is through the IMO rather than through the London Dumping Convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to Mr Keating's description of the government's green paper on employment in which he said, `. . . is not a job creation thing. It is a labour market efficiency flexibility thing, it is principally a social thing . . . it is a jobs ready thing'. Particularly in the light of the recently passed Industrial Relations Reform Bill which actually decreases the flexibility thing and the market efficiency thing for businesses, can the minister inform the Senate what effect he envisages the white paper will have in the end on the real goal of this exercise to permanently decrease the number of long-term unemployed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever effect a white paper has will depend on what particular policy strategies are implemented after the options canvassed in that paper have been given full and due consideration by the government after a full consultative process with the whole community. It is not a matter of making any assumptions at all at this stage as to what the particular strategy will be emerging from that white paper. Obviously, the key to job growth in this country, as the white paper makes clear, is continued economic growth overall associated with a continued program of structural adjustment and micro-economic change, including labour market flexibility. We fully acknowledge that. That has always been part of the approach and the strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that the industrial relations legislation we have just passed in any way inhibits that is to profoundly misunderstand the nature of the industrial relations system in this country and the contribution that that legislation will be making to giving further institutional confidence in that system and, at the same time, generating a greater degree of flexibility so far as productivity bargaining and all the rest in the workplace are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty we have with members of this opposition, as I said the other day, is that they have only about one idea a decade. They take forever to formulate strategies to go with that idea and they find it very difficult to move beyond that to cope with emerging, evolving, changing circumstances. What the government has done over the course of the last decade is to introduce many ideas simultaneously into our economic reform and our approach to the economic system. We have done an enormous amount to generate structural change, greater flexibility, growth and movement forward in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is mired in an approach to industrial relations which was born and which failed in the 1960s and the 1970s. It is mired in an approach to micro-economic reform and taxation reform which has demonstrably failed and which is demonstrably irrelevant to the needs of this country. The government does not need any lectures from the opposition. It failed in government; it has failed in opposition; and it has failed to produce any kind of coherent alternative that could possibly be attractive or useful to this Australian society.</PARA>

The difficulty that those opposite confront here, as elsewhere, is that they simply do not understand what is going on out there in the marketplace; they do not understand the institutional pressures that are at work; and they do not understand the needs of the great mass of Australians, including those who have benefited in the past from the operation of that industrial relations system safety net and will continue to do so in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Media reporting of the green paper on restoring full employment seems to have simplified, at the urging of the opposition, the key issue as being whether or not there should be a tax levy to fund certain measures to reduce unemployment. Does this miss the key point of both the green paper and the government's approach? Is the real challenge facing Australia a question of whether or not to impose a tax levy, or does the government perceive a more fundamental challenge?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question follows well from the first one because it does raise the proper priorities that we should be considering in dealing with the issue of unemployment. There is an obsession broadly in Australia, and certainly amongst the opposition, with the issue of taxation. Taxation, while an important measure, is a second order issue in what we are talking about here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green paper's purpose is both social and economic. Its purpose is to inform us all about the dimensions of the social and economic problem of unemployment&mdash;and we have to remember that it is both those things. If we seek to have a purely economic solution, we will fail to deal with the social consequences of what is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a simple way to make that point clear. I used one example yesterday for Senator Boswell; let me try another today. Even if we achieve what the green paper says is possible and necessary, which is growth in the order of 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent per year, further measures would still be necessary to ensure that the long-term unemployed have a fair go in sharing in the benefits of this growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are at least two things that we have to deal with&mdash;and I am sorry if dealing with two things at the same time is too hard for some people. We have to have policies to get the rate of growth that will generate the jobs; that is a necessary condition to deal with the problem of unemployment. In 1983 to 1990, Australia had the highest rate of jobs growth in the OECD, but it was not sufficient to get down the long-term unemployed as much as we would have wished. It went down, but not as much as we would wish. It is necessary, as we recover from this recession and go for more growth, to ensure that those people do not become marginalised and excluded from our society and the economic processes within it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the key proposal in the green paper, in my view&mdash;and I think in the government's view overall&mdash;is the job compact. We have to look at the merits of it. I am not saying that everything in it is right or whatever. I am saying that that is the key concept, not some second order tax question about how we fund it. The job compact proposed in the green paper is a fundamental element in achieving this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to do and what those concerned with constructive contribution to the public policy debate should be doing&mdash;and what many citizens are doing, but not the opposition&mdash;is say, `What are the merits of the job compact proposal, the proposal to ensure that the long-term unemployed get at least some work for six or nine months and the opportunity to do more?'. If it is our view that this is something that needs to be done, then of course the questions of how it is funded become central. But we have to get to the first step first. Let us deal with this profound social and economic question at its core first and get to the tax question, if it ever arises, when we get to the issue of what it is that we want to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second flaw has been the view that there has been no benefit from the labour market programs already pursued by the government. It is quite clear that all of them&mdash;jobstart, job clubs, jobtrain&mdash;have all substantially improved the chances of the long-term unemployed securing and holding employment. So there is a basis there of labour market programs that have had successes of between 33 per cent and 50 per cent and in some instances, with jobstart, doubling the chances of the long-term unemployed securing and holding employment. So there is a base of successful labour market programs there on the existing policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jobs compact is a very interesting proposal to build on that basis. I would urge citizens who want to make a positive contribution to this debate, instead of just going off on a tax tangent, to focus on that to see if that is the appropriate priority. We then will have a public policy debate about whether something needs to be done to fund it and, if so, what.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister said yesterday that there is no doubt that this is really outstanding news for Australia with the Uruguay Round representing the largest ever world trade deal and a much needed shot in the arm for the world economy. Australia will be a major beneficiary of the round with recent analysis indicating that exports could increase by as much as $5 billion annually when the round fully takes effect, and Australia's GDP could increase by up to $3.7 billion annually. All sectors of the Australian economy&mdash;agriculture, manufacturing and services&mdash;will benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion of the round does represent, in particular, a turning point for world agricultural trade and for Australian agriculture. After years of increasing exports of heavily subsidised agricultural products by the United States and the European Community, we will now see a steady reduction in export subsidies for the rest of this decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook set as his main task while he was in Geneva obtaining the best possible market access deal for Australia; this he has done. Among those receiving major improvements in market access is the beef industry where the access level into the US market of 380,000 tonnes negotiated by Senator Cook will be over 25 per cent higher than the likely restraint level applicable in 1994. Importantly, Australian exporters of beef will, from 1995 onwards, no longer be subject to the vagaries of the meat import law formula, which has seen our access into the US market decline over the last four years. On top of this, beef exporters will also gain from greatly improved access into the Korean beef market and, while there are already rapidly expanding exports to Japan, they will benefit from a further reduction in the Japanese beef tariff. Beef, however, is not the only winner; other agricultural commodities such as rice, dairy and horticulture will all register major gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the manufacturing sector the GATT round has delivered the largest result ever. Indeed, the Uruguay Round outcome is 30 times larger than that obtained from previous rounds. As a result, Australia's exporters of manufactured goods will see a cut in tariffs of more than 50 per cent on average, while our exporters of coal will also see an improvement in market access, particularly into Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement on services provides for the first time international trade rules, which will enable Australian exporters of services, already worth some $15 billion, to compete on the same basis as other services exporters. There will be major benefits to Australian exporters, particularly of intellectual property. For smaller and medium sized economies, such as Australia's, an effective rules based international trading system does provide the best opportunities for increasingly liberalised trading conditions. The strengthening of GATT and its institutional structure through the establishment of what I now understand is to be called the World Trade Organisation, WTO, is of itself a major benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook, despite the agreement having been reached in Geneva and most negotiators having now packed their bags, is nonetheless continuing to press for even further concessions on a bilateral basis in a number of our key markets. The outcome of any additional deals that might be produced from this process is not yet available, but we will certainly be announcing that as soon as results are known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues&mdash;Senator Cook and his predecessors going back to the beginning of the round: Mr Kerin, Dr Blewett, Mr Duffy and Mr Dawkins&mdash;have all done an absolutely outstanding job on behalf of Australia. I simply add that the great many officials past and present, too numerous to name individually, both in Canberra and in the delegation in Geneva, have contributed through their professionalism, dedication and sheer persistence to an outcome for Australia which would not otherwise have been achieved.</PARA>

One is the former deputy secretary of my department, Peter Field; the other is his successor in that job, David Hawes, who played a particular role as chairman of the services negotiations in Geneva in recent days. Between them they have made a contribution, not only for Australia but for the round as a whole, which has been universally and internationally applauded.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing could be further from the truth that there has been some shift from the have-nots to the haves. It is rather a situation of a much bigger cake for everybody with everyone benefiting. What Senator Coulter should appreciate is that the trade liberalisation and increase in global growth which will stem from the round will result in a very major net increase in world income. While the benefits will vary between countries&mdash;whether or not they are developed or developing will be one of the relevant considerations&mdash;all countries will gain. There is no question of countries gaining at the expense of others. That is just not the way the arithmetic of this works out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assume that the figures quoted by Senator Coulter on the benefits from the round stem from a recent World Bank-OECD report. That report, which is, as I understand, the source of those figures, makes it very clear that the benefits to the global economy of trade liberalisation are overwhelmingly positive, with the successful round outcome providing a boost to global economic activity of the order of, in Australian dollar terms, over $400 billion annually by the year 2002.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, that same World Bank report makes clear that developing countries will benefit from the Uruguay Round outcome. Indeed, many of these countries, many of whom are members of the Cairns Group along with Australia, when it comes to agricultural negotiations have been actively pressing the major OECD countries to bring the round to a quick and successful conclusion. As the World Bank report stresses, it is developing countries that would have suffered most from a continuation, or worse still an intensification, of protectionism. They know that; they have been among the most active boosters of all for the round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The special needs of the developing countries have been recognised since the outset of the round and these are reflected in the outcome.

I share his view that now is not the time to take the easy way out that some call for, which is the idea of universal screening.

The annual report of the Industry Commission also stated that public utility monopoly pricing above marginal costs `is simply another form of indirect taxation'. Does the government consider that higher charges for water and other necessities of life are any fairer as taxes on families than taxes on food and clothing, which were rejected by the public at the last poll?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Mrs Kelly has provided advice to the Minister for Resources concerning his imminent decision to grant woodchip export licences. The letter from the environment minister contains a list of forestry coupes which should be protected from logging. Firstly, of the thousands of coupes across the country, is it the case that about 500 are worthy of protection from logging? Secondly, is it the case that, after great difficulty, the department of the environment reduced this figure to between 80 and 90 coupes? Thirdly, did the minister then reject the advice of her department and not send this number to Mr Lee but further cut the number to be protected? Is it the case that, in the letter which the minister has sent to Mr Lee, only about half the number&mdash;in other words, 40 or 50 coupes&mdash;will be protected?

That advice was forwarded to the Minister for Resources. The minister has not taken a more conservative position than her department.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of this program, the Prices Surveillance Authority is continuing to monitor coastal shipping freight rates until mid-1996 to ensure that benefits will flow through to the users. Earlier this month the PSA released its second monitoring report, which concluded that shipping reform has been successful in providing lower cost structures for coastal ship operators. Shippers have benefited from continued stability and freight rates in 1991 and 1992. The PSA finds that shipping companies are not receiving returns significantly exceeding their costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable benefits are found in the report from the encouragement given to investment in new, more efficient ships and more flexible and multi-skilled crews.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australia Today: Indonesia '94 promotion, which we will be running in Indonesia in June-July next year, will be the largest trade and cultural promotion ever undertaken by Australia in that country. It will be a major trade and cultural showcase for Australia in Indonesia highlighting achievements in trade and industry, science and technology, the arts, education, sport, media, film and tourism. The program will include a major science and technology exhibition; a business and trade exhibition; business conferences and seminars; performances by the Western Australian Ballet, Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and other performing and visual arts groups; and a sports program between Australian and Indonesian associations.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indonesia is a country of over 180 million people, with an economy which continues to grow at over six per cent a year. I take this opportunity to urge Australian companies to seize the moment to join with the Australian government in making this promotion, Australia Today: Indonesia '94, even more successful than the promotion which has just ended in Japan. It will help them and this country to generate new business links with Indonesia. It will also help to build the image of a sophisticated, technologically advanced country, which is exactly what we do want to promote in the region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just as earlier today in question time Senator Gareth Evans outlined the significant achievements of GATT overall for Australia and gave detailed evidence about the achievement for agriculture&mdash;agriculture has been a major feature of our work in the GATT because of the work done by the Cairns Group&mdash;it is often not understood that GATT will have major benefits to Australia for both our manufacturing and service industries. Our exports in manufacturing are growing rapidly. Only a month or so ago, figures for October of this year revealed that exports grew by 11.3 per cent in the manufacturing area. Clearly, Australia is on the right track in the growth of manufacturing exports. That is why the GATT outcome announced last night from Geneva is very important for manufacturing. Benefits will flow to a range of companies from large raw material processors to niche manufacturers of sophisticated, high technology products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, BHP's steel export strategy will receive a significant boost because tariffs on steel products in a number of major countries, including the US, Canada and Japan, will be eliminated. In high-tech, the outcome of pharmaceuticals, for example, provides for the immediate elimination of tariffs, including those in Europe, the US, Japan and Canada. Of course, the government's policies for pharmaceuticals mean that Australian based companies are well placed to become regional manufacturing centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia's service sector, GATT means greater access through transparent and fair regulations. For example, when bidding for overseas contracts, Australian construction companies will now have a quality of status with other bidding countries and access to clearer bidding guidelines; our internationally competitive telecommunications sector will now have access to previously denied markets; and our banks and legal firms will also benefit from newly opened markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our firms are well placed to reap the benefits from this liberalised trading environment. This all fits in with the theme of the Australian Manufacturing Council report, done by the McKinsey group earlier this year, which outlined how 700 high growth manufacturing exporters were helping Australia's exports and showing us the way. In manufactures, what the GATT round will do is give us every opportunity to turn that 700 into 7,000 exporting firms, particularly in the small to medium sized enterprise area. Just as the farming sector will welcome the GATT round decisions as being of big benefit to that sector, long overdue, the policies of this government which encouraged the expansion of manufacturing exporters during the 1980s and the early 1990s will get major benefit from the GATT round.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Yes.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his question Senator Crane expressed concern that it would be possible, in some circumstances, for a secondary boycott on the export of live sheep to come within an exemption under proposed section 162 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senator suggested that this would "force farmers to go back to the wharves and load live sheep to protect their livelihood and their markets."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a secondary boycott on the export of live sheep were to occur for industrial purposes, it could be prohibited by proposed section 162. This would apply if the boycott had, as an immediate and substantial purpose, the causing of substantial loss or damage to the business of the target of the boycott and if the boycott had, or was likely to have, that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While section 162 prohibits secondary boycott action, certain exemptions from the prohibition are provided for under section 162. This does not, however, affect the application of common law actions in tort. Accordingly, a secondary boycott which obstructed the export of live sheep and which came within an exemption could still be the subject of such a common law action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the boycott involved a federally registered trade union, and such a common law action was proposed, then, under proposed section 166A, there would be up to 72 hours of pre-litigation conciliation by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission before the action could be brought. This is the maximum period of pre-litigation conciliation. The period ceases immediately if the Commission is satisfied that it cannot stop the relevant conduct promptly or if the Commission decides that it would cause substantial injustice not to permit the legal action to be brought before the expiry of the pre-litigation period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 166A does not apply where the relevant conduct involves personal injury or wilful or reckless harm to property or its unlawful use. Similarly, section 166A does not apply to a demarcation dispute or a claim for strike pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no reason why, in the example given by Senator Crane, farmers would need to resort to any action apart from following proper processes before an industrial tribunal or, if it were necessary, before a court for a legal remedy. It would be regrettable if farmers or anyone else in the community were given the impression that any other steps were necessary or appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans and many other ministers on the government side, together with many people on the opposition side, do not seem to understand that economic growth does not equate with benefit. Senator Evans evidently does not understand that when one pollutes the environment one spends dollars on cleaning up the environment and those dollars go down as an addition to GDP.

So, first of all, I think it needs to be understood that growth does not equate with benefit. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Ian Macdonald's concern, I want to make it clear that I do not criticise&mdash;I think it is too early to do so&mdash;the decision that was taken at the special premiers conference by the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and the then premiers and chief ministers to provide for that clear demarcation of responsibility. The decision has much to commend it. It was intended to clearly demarcate the responsibilities of the various authorities&mdash;state, local and federal&mdash;for road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrangement was that the federal government would be responsible for the defined national highway system. We are spending about $820 million a year directly on that system. State and local government authorities would be responsible for their own roads other than the 18,500 kilometres of the national highway. In order to fund those roads, they would receive untied grants from the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said during question time, we provide around $700 million per annum of those grants. I might also add&mdash;this is an important point to make in response to Senator Macdonald's question&mdash;that this represents only a fraction of the total amount of money spent on roads in Australia, which is in the order of $6 billion per year and which is spent by federal, state and local authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The performance of state governments generally in spending those untied grants on roads has been good.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I said in my answer is the truth. I am glad that the money was spent within the transport system. But it is a general concern&mdash;it was raised at the last transport ministers meeting and is a concern that is shared by state transport ministers&mdash;that the untied grants that the Commonwealth provides, which are significant, are spent at least in the transport areas of state governments. </PARA>

That was one prime example that got some publicity because road users complained about it. The general spending of these untied grants by state governments has been responsibly spent on roads.

<PARA>Honourable senators may not be aware of the significance of my question. The significance of my question to Senator Richardson was that the entire health package will be subject to veto by the ACTU caucus working party. He did not deny the fact that the whole of his health package will be sent to an ACTU caucus working party. Senator Richardson's proposals are now in total disarray. The Senate will recall that his first proposal was for a higher Medicare levy. When the heat was too much, he sent it off to the ACTU caucus working party. The significance of an ACTU working party is beyond me. This is another clear demonstration that everything this government does is subject to the imprimatur of the ACTU. There is a total alliance. In fact, the minister is almost proud of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's second point was that there should be an unholy alliance between the insurance associations and the private hospitals of Australia to contract procedural people attending those hospitals so that they could cap fees. That has been opposed by practically every organisation around the place. The only ones in favour of that action are some of the insurance associations because they see bigger money in it for them. Of course there is political capital in it for the government because then the private hospitals and the insurance associations would be able to attempt to control costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard it said that this would create a two tier health system. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) should be aware that it would create a three tier health system. People of any ability would not work in that system and they would continue as they do now, contracting their services on a one to one basis with their patients. The second tier would be those who could not get patients to go to them and they would perhaps enter into those contracts. The third tier would be the public hospital system as it exists today. That proposal is to be considered by an ACTU caucus working party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's proposed third tier is designed to limit the number of insurance associations that are controlling the private insurance industry. Why that is occurring is again beyond me because 83 per cent of people who are insured in Australia are under the aegis of seven insurance companies. The minister wishes to reduce that number. The other 17 per cent of people are controlled by two groups of organisations&mdash;11 of which are regionally based and the remainder are industry based. There is nothing to be achieved by this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was more significant in the minister's answer to me today was that he had no alternatives. As I said yesterday, if one comes down on both sides of the fence it can be very painful. That is what the minister is about to do. On the one hand, if his proposals go ahead he is effectively dismantling Medicare. That is significant and is recognised by the Left and the Centre Left of the Labor Party. If, on the other hand, his proposals do not go ahead, he is totally discredited because he has no alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has no answer to the rapidly declining number of people who are able to afford private health insurance in this nation. The number is decreasing at a rate of two per cent per annum. It is now less than 39 per cent. In my own state of Queensland it is down to 30 per cent and declining. The minister has no answer to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only chance for the survival of Medicare in this country is if people are accommodated by the private hospital industry and the private health associations. People who are unable to afford private health insurance, or do not wish to afford it, can stay under the umbrella of Medicare. Unless something drastic is done to rapidly improve the opportunities for lower and middle income earners to take out private insurance, the health system will not survive. The minister knows that, I know that and anybody with any knowledge in this field knows that. It must be done as a matter of urgency. However, it will not be done. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)That the Senate censures the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) for his contempt of the Senate in failing to answer its order that he lay on the table of the Senate a copy of the letter sent on 14 December 1993 by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) detailing the conditions which should be attached to woodchip export licences and indicating the forest coupes to be excluded from the relevant forest area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)That Senator Evans purge his contempt by tabling the relevant document before 5 p.m. this day.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleagues are aware that the Senate passed a motion this morning that Senator Gareth Evans should table immediately after question time today the letter that has been referred to in the censure motion. The reasons for the request being given today and the urgency are that the particular letter specified in the motion is crucial for a decision regarding the decision of the Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) to renew woodchip export licences either today or tomorrow and making reference to environmental conditions that are to be imposed on those licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice given to the Minister for Resources on which areas of forests should be excluded from the export licences will seal the fate of priceless areas of natural heritage throughout Australia. Communities across Australia are extremely concerned about the fate of the forests in their areas and they have the right to know which areas are being protected by the minister for the environment and by this government, and which will be excluded. Such vital issues cannot be settled behind closed doors and without the opportunity for public input. My understanding is that Mrs Kelly had advice from her department&mdash;and I take Senator Coulter's correction of my earlier figure of 81&mdash;that 83 forest coupes were to be excluded from the licences and that this number was considerably reduced by Mrs Kelly herself prior to taking the matter to cabinet on Monday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly led the environment movement and the wider community to believe that she would force the government to adhere to the spirit and the letter of the moratorium clause in the national forest policy statement signed by the federal government more than a year ago. When I asked Senator Gareth Evans a question earlier this week, he assured me that the government would adhere to the spirit of the moratorium clause and he had no evidence to the contrary. He is now in contempt of the Senate for not tabling evidence that may well be to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause relating to protection of those old-growth areas&mdash;called the moratorium clause&mdash;states that activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that may have high conservation value should be avoided in these areas. If clear-felling for woodchips does not significantly affect these areas, I do not know what does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By reducing the number of coupes to be protected, by not forcing the immediate implementation of the national forest policy statement and by allowing the 1990 New South Wales forest logging agreement to override the national forest policy statement, the environment minister has failed in her duty to protect the environment. By these actions, Mrs Kelly has let down not only the environment movement but also the wider community. She has paved the way for wanton destruction of unique forests of immense ecological importance and has effectively disinherited all future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an even more disturbing suggestion regarding the content of Mrs Kelly's letter. Most of the coupes that were successful in gaining Mrs Kelly's protection are in the vicinity of Batemans Bay, within and very close to Mrs Kelly's own electorate. Mrs Kelly has refused several requests to reveal the contents of this letter. As environment minister, she is accountable to parliament and the people of Australia and, in this chamber, she is accountable via the Leader of the Government in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's actions&mdash;or lack of actions&mdash;indicate that she cannot be trusted to act in the best interests of the environment. This chamber is not being allowed to properly fulfil its role and that is why earlier in the day we requested the suspension of standing orders for the Leader of the Government to table that letter. By his failure to table this letter, Senator Gareth Evans and the government are in need of censure for their lack of transparency and accountability and their failure to accord to the environment the priority it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister for the environment is obviously causing grave concern throughout the environment movement in Australia at the moment. But I must also add that the government has a responsibility to allow the minister for the environment to be able to give correct and proper advice to other ministers, for example, the Minister for Resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since European colonisation, less than five per cent of Australia's original native forests have survived and only 13 per cent of these are protected in reserves and national parks. Despite signing the national forest policy more than a year ago, states are still allowing old-growth forests to be logged. In many areas, logging for woodchips is intensified, with trees aged between 300 and 500 years being chipped for paper that will end up on the garbage dumps of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unconscionable that before we have even adequately identified the diversity of species, existing wilderness and old-growth forests, these areas are being wiped out. Whole ecosystems are destroyed by clear-felling and with them goes the habitat of vulnerable and endangered species. In Western Australia alone, there are 11 plant species, four bird species and seven mammal species under threat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I take a point of order. When we supported this censure motion&mdash;and the minister is sitting here to take his punishment&mdash;I thought it was going to be a censure motion. I have heard nothing from Senator Chamarette to date that is in the nature of a censure motion. All I can hear is somewhat of a second reading speech. Mr Deputy President, I think you should get her to address the point of the motion, and that is to censure the minister. She can make any sort of second reading speech in an adjournment debate some other time. We have given her our help to get this motion up and I wish she would address it.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that advice. I am sure that Senator Panizza will be able to assist me in directing some of that censure to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. From my point of view, the major contempt of the Senate is that there is a failure of the government to respond to the widespread concerns of the community about the government's failure to support the role of the minister for the environment in protecting our environment. Instead, the government is covering up for her and preventing the community from seeing whether she is doing her job. We do not know whether this government is being portrayed correctly or whether it is actually responsible for our failure to protect old-growth forests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are protests in every forest area around Australia at the moment. Those protests are the most ardent form of censure one could possibly have of an environment minister and of a government that protects that environment minister when she fails to defend those areas of forest that it is her responsibility to defend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans and the government, by their failure to table the letter of the minister for environment to the Minister for Resources, have demonstrated to the community a contempt for the Senate and a contempt for the community about the areas that are being wantonly destroyed. So I censure the government and the Leader of the Government in the Senate for their lack of transparency and accountability, for their failure to accord to the environment the priority it deserves and for their failure to respect the order of the Senate when it reasonably demands that the letter that the minister for the environment has given as her advice be tabled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I can just explain my position on this: I indicated in the debate this morning that I declined to produce the document in question on the grounds of confidentiality and the absence of compelling public interest. I stand by that position. It is no joke to be the subject of a censure in this place, and I certainly understand the reaction of the Greens and their concern that this particular issue be dealt with in this way. I am not seeking to suggest that there are no public interest dimensions to final decisions on export licences. There are, and the government will be quite willing to make public the relevant considerations taken into account when those decisions are made, when those decisions are finalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no overriding public interest to be served in tabling this document, particularly as it is clear that, in seeking it, the main objective is not to obtain the information itself but rather to put pressure upon the government and upon the government's decision-making process. By seeking disclosure at this stage of Mrs Kelly's letter, the honourable senator is in effect seeking to have the Senate attack and replace with its own views the manner in which executive decisions are reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been the subject of debate on a number of previous occasions in this place. When I launched a stinging attack on the then government in 1982 for its failure to produce certain documents relating to tax avoidance and evasion, I was confronted with exactly the argument that I now put&mdash;that these are matters for executive government consideration. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chamarette" NAMEID="SN5">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not satisfied at the time but circumstances change. It is called situation ethics. I suppose Senator Chamarette would be familiar with that concept. The truth of the matter is that executive governments from time immemorial have claimed some degree&mdash;not a complete degree&mdash;of immunity from scrutiny of their internal processes in order to enable decision making to take place in an orderly way, and allow communications to pass between ministers and policy issues to be addressed in a way that is not necessarily the subject of intense public scrutiny at the time that that decision making process is still under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the view of the coalition government at that time against me and my motion&mdash;it is all spelt out in Odgers where this ranks as one of the great precedents in attempts by the Senate to impose its will, and resistance by the government of the day. The view was that under the constitution it is ministers of state who are appointed to make the sorts of decisions that we were talking about then, and which we are talking now. While ministers may be responsible to parliament for those decisions&mdash;I guess this is the key point&mdash;it is not for parliament to supplant the role of ministers in reaching those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have to explain ourselves. We will have to be accountable. Minister Lee will have to be accountable for the decision he makes. No doubt he will wish to put on the public record the reasons for the decision, whatever it is, that he does make in the exercise of his discretion and statutory responsibility. But he ought, as a matter of good governance, to be allowed to get on with the business of making that decision and taking such advice as he thinks is legally appropriate to make it, without this subjection of every bit of paper&mdash;or the bit of paper that Senator Chamarette wants on this occasion&mdash;to being called up and scrutinised in the public domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these questions of executive privilege, public interest immunity or public interest claims of the kind that I am making, there is in this instance&mdash;as I said this morning&mdash;a possible question of commercial confidentiality. Nobody has ever doubted that commercial confidentiality can be a perfectly appropriate ground for declining to produce the information in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that it would undermine the proper functioning of government, and the proper functioning of the processes of ministerial accountability as they have been developed over many centuries, for such a working document to be made public. What we are talking about here is a working document which may be used by a minister in the process of reaching a decision under his statutory responsibility, but which does not itself govern, let alone dictate, the decision in question. This is simply another piece of information that is relevant to the decision making process in which the minister will engage and he is entitled to make his decision without having to make these sorts of disclosures. The government and individual ministers should not have to worry about the Senate trying to second-guess every step of the decision making process before it is complete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arguments are well-founded in the precedents of this place. There have been many instances of documents being sought to be disclosed, and a number of instances of governments accepting that the balance of public interest is in favour of disclosure; but there have equally been many instances over the years where governments&mdash;ministers&mdash;have taken a different view. The latter situation is the view that is being taken on this occasion. So if Senator Chamarette censures me as a result of that, I guess I will just have to bear that fate with such fortitude as I can command. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) is quite correct in saying that there are essentially two issues involved in this censure motion. There are long and extensive precedents in relation to the revelation of detailed advice to ministers on which they finally make decisions. The other issue is the substantive issue of the forests and what is actually happening there. It is a matter of what sort of priority one gives to those two issues. I would have to disagree very sharply with the minister when he gives priority to the procedural secrecy over the destruction of Australia's forests. It seems to me that this is clearly an instance where the public interest should override the precedent of parliamentary process by which ministers are not accountable for those actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know that we have a wealth of documentation from New South Wales in relation to the way in which ministers there have been consistently ignoring very sound advice in relation to the protection of those forests, going totally against the advice and giving no explanation as to why they are going against the advice. Given that, it becomes even more urgent that we understand exactly why and how it is that Minister Kelly, in this instance, has gone against what we understand to be extremely sound advice&mdash;conservative advice, as Senator Chamarette has pointed out, because the 83 coupes which we understand were mentioned are only a fraction of the coupes that could well fit within the national forest policy statement which talks about the protection of areas of high conservation value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Kelly has evidently received extremely conservative advice and yet has been even more conservative in her advice to Minister Lee. Given the history which many of us now have in documentation in relation to New South Wales, that is indeed extremely worrying. When one puts that together with the information that Senator Chamarette has just given us&mdash;that it may well be that those coupes that are to be protected are in the Bateman's Bay area&mdash;it raises very serious questions as to whether the minister is not being guided by some motivation other than the proper protection of the forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats can only add their voice to that of censure. We believe that in this instance the public interest far and away exceeds the precedential arguments which the minister has used. It is absolutely appropriate for the Leader of the Government in the Senate to be censured. If and when we see the results of the decision&mdash;I understand that decision on the renewal of the licence is imminent; it may be as near as tomorrow&mdash;I foreshadow that it is very likely that we will proceed to censure the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in the very next session. If our presumptions are correct in relation to the sort of advice that she has given to her fellow minister, then I think she has certainly not served her portfolio in the way in which she should. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or ladylike. To be honest, the whole issue at the moment concerns the letter from Mrs Kelly to Mr Lee. It really does seem a particularly harmless letter and for the minister to try to claim commercial confidentiality is quite outrageous. Surely the details of conditions about an export licence should be on the public record. The minister has had an opportunity to put it on the record. Commercial or government confidentiality is so often used as an excuse for not tabling documents in this place. Only this week, you yourself, Mr Deputy President, had no joy in getting Minister Bolkus to table documents pertaining to his wild allegations about the Western Australian Attorney-General, Mrs Edwardes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, we have seen enough of this government over the last almost 11 years totally ignoring requests made by the Senate. Senators Cook and Collins have been censured in this place many times in the last few years and absolutely nothing has happened. So I say to Senator Chamarette that even though this motion may be passed, she should not hold her breath that it will actually mean anything. Sadly, the response by this government has not been to uphold the traditions of the Westminster system of government whereby a minister who is censured resigns or is dismissed. This government just completely and utterly ignores a censure in the same way in which it is ignoring this request that has been made by Senator Chamarette today. It is on that basis that we will be supporting the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, we understand that this issue is very near and dear to Senator Chamarette's heart. We might differ on that subject but, from the opposition's point of view, the issue in question here is whether or not this government will be accountable in respect of an order of the Senate which was made this morning. Sadly, I do not believe that it will be. For the government to continue to ignore such orders made by the Senate is an absolute and utter contempt of the Senate. It has become commonplace for this government to act in such a manner. Senators from all parties in this place cannot continue to condone this type of action and let the government off the hook. If a request has been made by the Senate, the government should be made to deliver on that request, and on time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are seeking to censure because requested information has not been tabled. It is my belief that the tabling of that information is not insignificant; that the information reveals or contributes to a story about a conflict in cabinet&mdash;not that that is unusual. Cabinet is an appropriate place to resolve conflicts and to look at alternative positions. We are told almost daily of differing ministerial agendas which are resolved in cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that this conflict has arisen because the government is trying to promise to be all things to all people in this debate about our forests and resources. It seems that there is an irreconcilable conflict. The resources minister and Minister Kelly are on opposing sides of a conflict which cannot be resolved by promises being met. Although this is the impression we have, we do not know whether this is the case. The question is: is this so? It seems to me that a great step could be taken towards answering this question if the letter were tabled. This would reveal the degree of the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans has described this letter as a working document which might be used by a minister in the process of reaching a decision. In fact, without knowing precisely, we suspect that this paper relates to Minister Kelly's decision&mdash;that it is a finite point of her decision making process and, therefore, deserves public scrutiny in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without that letter, the public has little capacity to evaluate Minister Kelly's performance in this regard&mdash;and the public deserves to have all that is necessary to evaluate Minister Kelly's performance. As has been mentioned by my colleague Senator Coulter, it seems very likely that, without sufficient documentation, Minister Kelly's performance, on any sort of scrutiny, is starting to look very sick indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, the one thing this letter could reveal is a little more information about coupes. One of the problems with debates in this place is that we encounter words which are not used in the public arena. Although `coupe' only recently has been placed into our vocabulary, it is a word which has existed for some time in the terminology of foresters and those who would wish to govern the actions of loggers. But in the public arena, the word `coupe' has only recently emerged. I think this word is very important because it seems to be at the centre of what might be in this letter&mdash;whether there are 41, 39 or 83 coupes being recommended for protection against the activities of resource extractors during this coming forest resource extraction season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coupes in this context are small zones of forest&mdash;very small, indeed, really. They are zones accessed by road for the removal of resources. Trees that are resourced are turned into logs and taken away during the season. The coupes may vary in size from a couple of hectares to a couple of dozen hectares. But I would point out that saving or putting aside 40, 50, 83 or even 200 coupes&mdash;it is a question of the quantity and even perhaps the quality&mdash;is not really a great step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really need to look at the letter or the document that we are seeking to be able to evaluate the quality of the areas which may have been recommended. The exploitation of one coupe in a forest compromises the scenic, tourist and wilderness values of that forest. The exploitation of several coupes can actually threaten species&mdash;the variety, the ecology and the very balance upon which, eventually, our own livelihoods depend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter will not answer those questions for us, but it will reveal the particular coupes, what consideration has been given, how they interrelate with each other and whether there are, in fact, worthwhile recommendations. I do not think it is at all a matter of commercial confidentiality, as has been hinted by the minister. It seems to me that the letter may very well reveal a lack of systematic approach to which coupes are being recommended, why, and what relationship they have with each other; or whether there is a political relationship which is independent of any of those considerations. It may well reveal a great deal of ignorance in the decision making process by the minister. If I were trying to defend this position as Leader of the Government in the Senate, I would be very careful about revealing or tabling such a document which has the capacity to reveal the ignorance of the minister in the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter is at the fulcrum of the conflict in cabinet. This letter is also at the fulcrum of the debate between the so-called need, which some people recognise, to grab a little quick cash from the community's resources and the belief, which other people have, that it is the duty of government to protect, in a long-term guardianship role, the incredible and undetermined values of the community's resources. As Senator Coulter pointed out at question time today, these values as represented by the forests are not measured properly in this world. Because this letter is at the fulcrum of that debate, it is absolutely crucial that it be tabled. </PARA>

<PARA>This report deals with the people who generally supervise the running of the Public Service. I think it is proper at this stage to acknowledge the work that the people in the Public Service do. They come in for a lot of criticism from us at estimates and other committees, so it is proper at this time of the year that we acknowledge the great work they do and the very necessary function they perform so well for Australia. Having praised the Public Service generally, I come to those who give us public service in parliament and, in particular, the Senate. They include the attendants, people in transport and, indeed, the whole of the Senate staff under the very able direction and care of our Clerk, Mr Harry Evans and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the great help that we get from the people in transport, in particular, Comcar, which unfortunately is going through some difficulties at the moment which I hope are soon settled. Comcar drivers provide a great service and we owe them a great debt. I also thank the staff of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> who so patiently correct the words that we speak. I thank them for making a lot of magic out of some fairly poor material at times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note and give thanks to the advisers and those secretariats that so graciously, patiently, willingly and brilliantly look after the committees. And, finally, I come to the personal staff. I think I would be speaking on behalf of every member of parliament and everybody here now when I thank the people who help us in our offices. Those people who are attached to us as staff really make us what we are and I think it is proper to acknowledge that, without them, the quite brilliant work that is often done in these chambers would certainly not be done. I mention my own personal staff as an example: Marcia O'Hara, Lidia Argondizzo, Kevin Watt and, when one of those is taking time off, Karen Clark and Leanne Schulz. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of joining with Senator Cooney in thanking the general bulk of public servants around Australia who do support us and support the Australian public. Most of them do their jobs efficiently and well. Unfortunately, public servants have a bad reputation, but it is one that 99 per cent of the time is not warranted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People confuse the worst actions and decisions of this atrocious government that we have with the messengers who carry out the work of this government. It is a pity that Australians do not understand that it is not the public servants who should be criticised but the people who make the decisions. It is an absolute shame that Australia is in such a mess because of the actions of the Labor Party and its inability to properly manage the country, but that mismanagement and the anxiety a lot of people feel should not be taken out on public servants, most of whom do an excellent job. There are one or two political appointments and one or two who do act in a partisan way, but they will be noted. Certainly, by far the majority of them are very hardworking, diligent Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of them live in this town.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Knowles is drawing attention to a fact that I want to draw attention to; that is, yet again, as was the case last year, 33 documents were tabled today, a large number yesterday and I think a reasonable number over the whole week. With half an hour to consider documents, people who might like to say anything of substance have two chances of doing so&mdash;Buckley's and none. The reason is that if there is a wide range of documents being tabled&mdash;any one senator may have four, five or six on any one day that they want to look at&mdash;and they are not available until tabling, some not even then, that gives a very limited opportunity for a senator to have a look at the documents and pick out what they could possibly want to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as an example, I have here the Attorney-General's report, which I will speak to if we get to No. 19. I think I have two chances of that&mdash;Buckley's and none&mdash;but the prospect of my reading that between when it was available and now is just laughable. So the notion of parliamentary accountability, of our having a chance to have something of significance to say, has been totally ruined by the fact that we have a huge number of these tabled documents to look at in half of hour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a particular interest in the Copyright Agency Ltd. That is the agency that is authorised by the Commonwealth to collect copyright fees from a wide range of people. There is a view in the community that bodies such as the CAL are a law unto themselves. People would like to know where the money comes from, to whom it is disbursed and what happens with the remainder of the money that is not disbursed in any one year. The annual report might be of some assistance to us in ascertaining the facts as to those matters: who pays to the agency, how much it collects, how it pays out, how much it pays out and what it does with what is left. That is a matter of vital interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of particular interest because, as you may know, Mr Acting Deputy President, there are moves to make the Commonwealth and others pay copyright of a set fee per page for any newspaper article that is photocopied because print media journalists, as distinct from others, retain some sort of copyright over what they have written, over and above the copyright owned by the producer of the paper. They, if you like, forgo copyright for the purposes of their article being published in the paper but they do not forgo copyright for any further reproductions of that paper. That is quite unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means a huge boon to people who are successful enough to get a by-line but not too much at all for people who write stories and do not get their name on them. We might ask: where does that go to? It goes to the union&mdash;that is where it goes. So I would be particularly interested in sitting down and having a really good look through the Copyright Agency Ltd's report. I am only sorry that there are so many documents to be tabled today and so many other things that we all have to do that I am unable to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are serious questions as to whether the Copyright Agency is the appropriate collecting body for a variety of people. In particular, the matter of journalists is one of very special interest. I personally believe that the case can be made that there is no problem with people so successful as journalists that they want to say to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, or whoever employs them, `Yes, I will come and work for you for $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 or $170,000 a year'&mdash;or whatever&mdash;`but I want the right to retain my copyright. I'll give you my journalistic articles for your paper, but I retain the copyright if they are reproduced'. A good journalist will be able to negotiate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems ludicrous to maintain the present situation in which all print journalists have that as of right. The consequence is that we will have somebody trying to collect across the board and around the nation, and then there are questions of whether it is being distributed fairly. The overriding bottom line is that the money that it cannot see that it can distribute fairly&mdash;because there is no by-line on the article&mdash;in the end goes to the union. The question of whether the right to collect has been properly passed over to CAL by the union is a serious matter. It is a question of whether joining the union and signing the documents in fact gives the union the right to deal with the copyright rights. It is not a simple matter and not one that can be dealt with now. </PARA>

<PARA>I had three chances&mdash;a good chance, Buckley's and none&mdash;to be able to speak on the Attorney-General's report, and a good chance arrived. This is a two-volume report which is not easy for anyone to get across in a short space of time. I do not pretend to have done that. What I do want to raise is a practice the Attorney-General's Department has engaged in for a number of years, for which it is to be congratulated but which I would now like it to take one step further. The practice I refer to is that of listing in its annual report payments made to counsel by the legal practice of the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can turn to this alphabetical list of QCs and senior counsel who have been briefed on matters by the legal practice and we can see how much these people have been paid over the entire year. This is a matter of particular interest because the Commonwealth is a big user of legal services and, in that respect, has enormous power to affect the market, to affect the rates that are paid and to make a contribution to decreasing the cost of justice and increasing access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this list we have a kernel of a problem that parliament faces time and time again from people who want to keep things hidden. If we ask at an estimates committee how much was paid on a daily rate to Mr So-and-so, we are told, `I'm sorry, the Attorney-General's Department does not reveal the daily rate paid to barristers, but if you would like to look in the annual report you can see the total amount paid'. It is not a lot of help. I do not know whether someone who received $250,000 was working for 25 days or 10 days or 20 days. I have no idea of the genuine rates being paid. I have no idea of the extent to which the Commonwealth is using its market power to try to reduce the cost of justice. I do not know whether largess is being distributed willy-nilly or not. This list does not help me in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter in which the list does not help me, and a matter of importance, is in indicating which states get the money. In the federal jurisdiction, in commercial matters, for example, there are some states in which it is possible to get a matter up and through much more quickly than in another division. There are some states which would like to market themselves as being specialists in a particular area so that, if there is a choice of a registry in which to lodge on a federal matter, one might as a matter of costings choose, for example, my state, in a commercial matter, rather than Sydney, because of the delays in New South Wales. Being able to see how much the Commonwealth pays to counsel in different states would be of assistance in those comparisons and in drawing attention to the states which perhaps are not getting not so much their share of Commonwealth money but the recognition for the good job that they do. </PARA>

It sounds to me like the legal practice sent someone out to do half a guilty plea. A payment of $125 would be about that. Equally, we have people getting $292,000 and $205,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that I want to raise above the questions that I have raised thus far is the following. If we have a small business&mdash;a carpentry firm, for example&mdash;that does some work for any other Commonwealth agency, we can pick it up in estimates committees and pursue the matter of whether that work was done properly, how much was paid and whether a fair price was paid. But somehow the senior members of the legal profession have hoodwinked the Attorney-General's Department into thinking that these matters should be kept secret. I think it is a load of rubbish. It is about time it stopped. </PARA>

If the ABC wants to reflect the values, the beliefs and the composition of the Australian society, it ought to be a little bit more careful about the very left wing journalists it always seems to engage to do its national news broadcasts. I hasten to add that in Queensland, particularly in the rural areas, many ABC journalists&mdash;some of whom I suspect are not of my political persuasion&mdash;always give me and every politician a very fair go.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tried to read it; I had to borrow it. The issue of equal opportunity employment was discussed at a recent Senate estimates committee hearing. The discussions resulted from a number of newspaper advertisements that were run by the ABC which sought people of a particular background. One ad sought someone who had to be from a non-English speaking background to work in the sports and rural area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised this question with Mr David Hill at the Senate estimates hearings, he said that&mdash;I give him credit for this&mdash;he had looked at the ads; that he did not feel the ads were appropriate; and, that whereas the ABC would set targets, it did not set quotas. As far as he was concerned, the ads would be withdrawn and the positions reopened for advertisement and applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A week ago I received a letter from Mr David Hill and I have to say that it was one of the great backflips that we have seen. At the end of my remarks, I would like to table his letter. Mr Hill said in the letter that, on reconsideration of the evidence, he had decided that the ads would continue. He did not feel that it was appropriate that the advertisements should be readvertised because he felt that, among other things, it would be unfair to the people who had already applied and that it may be in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act. In other words, the ABC had to employ someone from a non-English speaking background and, if it withdraw the ad, it may well find itself in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. If that is the case, I have to say that Australia has indeed reached a pretty pass. </PARA>

When we pose the problem in that way, this situation seems absurd. I make it very clear that my daughter had not seen the ads and was not thinking of applying.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Kemp,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Senate Estimates Committee "E" hearing held on 15 November, I said that the ABC would re-advertise the ABC Radio trainee positions to which you referred during questioning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you know, these positions had been advertised on a basis that restricted the range of applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, now I have since fully considered the implications of withdrawing the advertisements and re-advertising the positions. In my consideration I have taken into account the ABC's statutory duties under the provisions of the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act, 1987, and the Special Measures provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act (1975) and the Sex Discrimination Act (1984).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are no doubt aware, as a Commonwealth Statutory Authority employer, the ABC is bound by the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act, 1987, which requires the Corporation to develop and implement an equal opportunity program to ensure that it reflects Australia's cultural diversity in its programming and staffing mix.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of these traineeships is to increase the representation of EEO designated groups in ABC Radio's staffing mix in specific areas where target groups are very under-represented. This is in line with both the Corporation's Charter obligation to "reflect the cultural diversity of Australia", and with EEO targets and strategies as set out in the "1993-1996 ABC Equal Employment Opportunity Management Plan".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Endorsement to specifically target and advertise these traineeships to designated groups as an affirmative action strategy was sought from, and granted by, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, under the Special Measures provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act (1975) and the Sex Discrimination Act (1984).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Special Measures provisions of the Acts apply when an organisation can demonstrate that it is targeting positions in order to redress an existing imbalance of EEO designated groups in its staffing mix .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To withdraw and re-advertise the positions at such a crucial stage of the selection process may disadvantage current applicants to such an extent that the ABC could be in breach of the Racial Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also relevant that the advertisements have already attracted a large field, with several positions in excess of 200 applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to abandon the selection process and, in light of the above, re-advertise the trainee positions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said at the Senate Estimates Committee "E" hearing:  "Over the last 10 years, the ABC has tried to devise equal employment opportunity plans to try to get its work force to more fairly reflect the community as a whole. The ABC is there to reflect and project what Australia is all about. To be quite honest, that will not happen until 50 per cent of all positions in the ABC are female, until about a third of them are people from non-English speaking backgrounds and until there is a representation of people who are disabled. The one area that we have targeted successfully is a fair representation of Aboriginal people. They are targets but the ABC is still a long way short of them in fairness or equal opportunity:  it is probably ahead of other institutions&mdash;certainly public institutions&mdash;in Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the ABC is reviewing its EEO policies to ensure that other than in exceptional circumstances strategies for recruitment are inclusive of all employment categories. References in advertisements will be monitored to reflect this commitment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I believe that the Auditor-General has done a great service by highlighting the lack of response by the Australian Customs Service to the recommendations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the Midford Paramount case. The concerns of the committee really fell into two parts at the end of that long inquiry. The first was the concern for the individuals who, as I have said on previous occasions, had their lives, reputations and businesses destroyed by the actions of the Australian Customs Service, and, to a degree, some officers in DITAC. The second was the concern that there needed to be a fundamental cultural change in the Australian Customs Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the question of compensation after 11 months and much prodding by the committee and individual members and senators, compensation of $25 million has been paid to those people who lost businesses, reputations and their health. But the other side of the coin&mdash;that is, the changes that need to take place in the Australian Customs Service itself&mdash;are dealt with at some length by the Auditor-General in report No. 25. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Midford Paramount case has become very widely known. It has become the benchmark for saying that this sort of behaviour in public administration by public servants is just not acceptable. It was very disappointing, even after the report was brought down, to still find the Customs Service taking the attitude that everybody else was wrong and it was the only one that was right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reluctance and tardiness with which the Australian Customs Service has attempted to implement any of the recommendations of the public accounts committee are highlighted in this report. After further prodding by the Auditor-General, there seems to be some acceptance by the Australian Customs Service that the recommendations we made, and that others have considered to be as important as we did, must be paid heed to. If you like, it has been dragged, kicking and screaming, into implementing some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions I am asked time and again are: are the people who were responsible for the taxpayer having to find $25 million to pay compensation for the wrongs that were done still in their jobs? What penalty have any of them paid? What changes have been made? The answer is a most unsatisfactory one. There has been very little change or penalty suffered by the people who are busy penalising others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Richardson, whose health perhaps suffered more than most to the extent that he was regularly hospitalised and has lost an enormous amount of weight and suffered enormous mental pressure, right at the beginning in evidence to the committee informed the Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Kelly, that the original prosecutions would fail. He was put on notice that to proceed in the way in which the Australian Customs Service was intending to proceed would fail and that what it was doing was wrong. Mr Kelly had the option of stopping those proceedings, but he chose not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Customs Service has been subject to another inquiry after the public accounts committee, which is known as the Conroy inquiry. We expect to hear the results of that inquiry in the not-too-distant future. All taxpayers need to see that a fundamental shake-up and change has taken place. At the moment, there is anger that wrong was done but that no personal penalties were paid and business seems to have gone on as usual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report is very useful in that it highlights the sorts of matters that the Customs Service must pay immediate attention to. As I said, 11 or 12 months after the initial report, the Customs Service is being dragged, kicking and screaming, to comply with it. I commend a good read of this report to members of the Senate. We expect to see the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) and the government taking action to satisfy the feelings of people in the electorate that they are not being run by the bureaucracy but are on top of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told Senator Schacht at the time he set up the Conroy inquiry that I would be delighted to cooperate with it in any way, shape or form that will mean that the recommendations of the public accounts committee and, indeed, any further recommendations that the Conroy committee might think are also necessary can be brought about speedily and expeditiously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still have good hopes of that inquiry. I have good hopes that action will be taken and that people will see that, after the years of work that went into disclosing the ineptitude, the obfuscation and the complete need for a culture change, compensation has been paid. Now we must take action to show that change will take place in the Australian Customs Service. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report finalises an inquiry begun in the last Parliament under my predecessor as Chair of the Committee, Senator the Hon Rosemary Crowley, now Minister for Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to thank my colleagues on the Committee, and former members, for their efforts in bringing the inquiry to a successful conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to thank the staff of the Committee for their work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main focus of the report is the impact of toxic algae blooms on Australia's water resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The blue-green algae which bloom so spectacularly in Australian rivers, lakes, reservoirs and other water bodies produce as part of their life cycle toxins which, if ingested by humans, can cause ailments such as gastroenteritis, hepatitis and hepatoenteritis, as well as other ill effects on which research is still proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, the effects of those toxins on the animal life which is dependent on water infected by excessive levels of blue-green algae are also harmful. In the case of livestock and fisheries these harmful effects have a direct economic result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economic costs of blooms of blue-green algae are somewhat difficult to measure. The Committee has found that a comprehensive cost benefit analysis is urgently needed to provide an indication of the type of data required on the social, environmental and economic costs of algal blooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of blue-green algal blooms in Australia in 1992/93 was estimated to be about $10 million by the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direct cost to the New South Wales Government of the large-scale algal blooms in the Darling River in 1991 was estimated at $1.3 million. Indirectly, it is estimated that the tourist industry in New South Wales lost $10 million in 1991 as a result of the algal blooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Blue-green algal blooms should be considered as a symptom of degraded water quality which has origins in the management of both water catchments and effluent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key to minimising the incidence and magnitude of blue-green algal blooms is to improve water quality through better management of catchments and effluent. This involves changes to land use planning, agricultural practices, drainage systems, effluent treatments and water management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a cost to be paid by the community for secure supplies of safe, clean water.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's report looks at the problem of the impact of blue-green algal blooms on Australia's water resources in the broader context of national management of water, water use and water quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report provides a summary of the physical and chemical factors instrumental in causing outbreaks of algal blooms. It looks at the implications in terms of the health effects, the public concern generated and the economic and environmental issues. It covers the techniques for prediction, monitoring, management and control of algal blooms. It looks at the roles of the three levels of government and the community in a national approach to management of algal blooms, and with respect to integrated catchment management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Total and integrated ecosystem management is essential, so that the ecological health of our waterways is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management of the toxic algae problem is part of land and water management in general.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As blue-green algal blooms have considerable complexity in their cause and effects, an integrated management approach having a range of short, medium and longer term mitigation measures will be needed to minimise bloom development and associated problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Single management measures are less likely to achieve beneficial results than a combination of measures, dealing with both water quantity and water quality management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implementation of prioritised management measures must be on the basis of identified benefits and costs&mdash;economic, social and environmental&mdash;where benefits equal or outweigh costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has identified 42 issues upon which to make recommendations. We regard all the recommendations as important, but there are several to which I would like to draw particular attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the nutrient elements required for algal growth, phosphorus is the key element for control. Phosphorus in sewage is a major source of excess phosphorus going into waterways, and a significant proportion of phosphorus in sewage comes from laundry detergents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told that other countries had achieved lower phosphate levels in detergents through marketing strategies which applied public pressure on the manufacturing companies. The report recommends that existing and proposed campaigns to achieve lower phosphate levels in detergents through marketing strategies be continued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several countries have legislated for low phosphate levels in detergents. As a result of such legislation in Canada and the United States limiting phosphorus in detergents to 2 per cent, algal blooms in Lake Erie have been significantly reduced. Lake Erie was declared `dead' a few years ago as a result of excessive levels of algae.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report therefore recommends that if a significant reduction in levels of phosphorus in detergents has not been achieved within two years then legislation should be enacted to reduce levels or ban phosphorus in detergents altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If legislation is required to reduce the levels of phosphorus in detergents, then the report recommends that manufacturers be given reasonable time to develop new or improve existing products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report also recommends that a national approach be adopted in relation to truth in labelling for detergent manufacturers in relation to phosphate levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Getting rid of toxic algae blooms requires more than reducing levels of phosphates in detergents. The Committee was told that the flow of water in rivers was the critical issue in managing the blue-green algae problem, and that the over-allocation of water to irrigation in the upstream areas of the Murray-Darling Basin had been the major factor which led to the 1000 kilometre-long bloom which took place there in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Up to 85 per cent of the average yearly volume of water in the Murray-Darling Basin may be diverted for irrigation. The committee was told that the over-allocation of water in the Dumaresq, Barwon and MacIntyre rivers was so great that existing allocations were realised in only 35 per cent of years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report therefore recommends that, as part of the development of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, no further irrigation water entitlements be issued in any area until it has been established that there is water available to meet the environmental requirements of the downstream sections of the waterway after existing allocations have been used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Water Quality Management Strategy is a most significant initiative. It is being formulated jointly by the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation  Council (ANZECC) and the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ). It is the first attempt to get integration between the environment and resource interests at a Commonwealth and State/Territory level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the national guidelines on water quality should be sufficiently flexible to be able to be applied to specific locations, and should have an ecological quality requirement rather than a purely physio-chemical basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report therefore recommends that the guidelines for the National Water Quality Management Strategy be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the natural variability in Australian freshwater ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that in 1982 the Australian Water Resources Council had observed that Australia's water research effort was `inadequate, fragmented and poorly balanced', and had substantial gaps. Immediate national needs were identified by the Council as being `sound management, leadership and substantially increased funding.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These research issues are now being addressed in the development of the Algal Bloom Research Framework, an ARMCANZ initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told that about $10.5 million per year was now being spent on algal bloom research, much of it in relation to other water-related issues and general water improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments must provide a consistent approach to funding to enable long-term research and investigation underpinning effective management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was of the view that a balance must be struck between rushing into doing some research merely to be seen to be doing something and the tendency to continue research indefinitely to justify a preconceived view or delay making hard decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the research conducted into overcoming the blue-green algae problem has a larger application to the health of waterways generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that the current levels of Commonwealth Government funding for research be maintained if not increased, and that consideration be given to long-term funding security for approved research projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States/Territories which have had significant problems with blue-green algal blooms have formed blue-green algal task forces, and have State/Territory contingency plans and regional bodies to develop local contingency plans. This focus has enabled better communications, assessment of priorities, research coordination, data collection and the implementation of more streamlined arrangements for algal identification, cell counts and toxicity testing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The Committee was told that lack of communication between some departments was causing confusion and that agency culture can be a problem. These situations can only be overcome if there is a clear definition of institutional responsibilities and accountabilities, where responsibility is shared, and there is timely communication and consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major roles of State/Territory governments is to provide the regulatory framework which sets standards to be achieved by upstream communities. Single issues managed by separate government authorities have led to a plethora of regulations. Governments are now working at overcoming this type of regulatory fragmentation, and any new legislation should link natural resource industries and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that the development of new legislation or other regulatory measures be required to demonstrate that due consideration has been given to the link between the natural resource industries and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulatory mechanisms need to clarify the responsibilities and roles of various government agencies. The Committee was told that even when there were acts of parliament which specified the responsibilities of particular government agencies, there was scope for them to deny that issues and responsibilities fell within their charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report therefore recommends that as part of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, regulatory mechanisms be reviewed to ensure that the respective responsibilities and roles of various government agencies are clearly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsequent to the 1991 algal bloom in the Murray-Darling Basin, there has been a great deal of publicity given to the blue-green algae problem. The public is now more aware of its extent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community involvement is an expensive and slow process, and the community must be well informed to be an active participant in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the community who pays the increased cost of improved treatments and the willingness to pay determines the water quality. This may create a difficulty in that everyone is involved but the authorities are still responsible, and majority decisions are not always correct in relation to technical and efficiency considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantial progress has been made in communicating the concept of ecologically sustainable water resources in some jurisdictions where successful initiatives have been based on individual approaches to each member of the community. The New South Wales State Algal Coordinating Committee has reported that the State Algal Contingency Plan is operating successfully and that the communities are now in a much better position to deal with algal blooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There must be a balance between providing sufficient information to enable national and State/ Territory-wide consistency, and the import</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ance of avoiding a bureaucratic takeover of the community process. It should be a process of the government assisting the local community to manage its own affairs while ensuring a clear decision making process which outlines the ground rules, and clear responsibility and authority for decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If government views are imposed on the community, then participation will cease when the funds are no longer forthcoming. If authorities do not have a genuine commitment to take on board community views then the community will become disinterested. Integrated catchment groups should be a partnership which has equal say for all parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Across Australia there has been a strong move towards integrated catchment management involving the community, industry and all levels of government. This movement has enormous potential to address the environmental problems involved in the management of our waterways, but there are still some matters to be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not clear to what extent the current catchment groups are representative of the community as a whole. It is important that all potential contributors be given the opportunity to participate in the development of local policy and be kept informed. All residents within the area covered by an integrated catchment management body should be eligible for and vote for election to these bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that community representatives be elected by their communities to positions on integrated catchment management committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential that adequate resources be supplied to assist with the enormous tasks expected of these groups. The question is what proportion of the total spending on resource management is allocated and controlled by the ICM groups responsible for the catchment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that adequate funding of integrated catchment management bodies be ensured, possibly as a proportion of the total expenditure on resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community education in relation to algal blooms has largely involved the symptoms and causes, but now the emphasis is shifting to management strategies and action plans and is becoming achievement oriented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should be more publicity given to successful models so that others can build on successes of those groups. The Committee was told that in some areas community education was still needed as to what the real issues were. The extent to which the community now understands the true situation and the necessary measures is uncertain in many areas, and even the level of community concern is not known. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Little information is available on the extent of the community's awareness and knowledge, and this information would be beneficial in developing new policy approaches. It is necessary that this be assessed to enable adequate planning of future educational programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report recommends that, as part the National Water Quality Management Strategy, the state of community awareness in relation to algal blooms be assessed so that specific problem areas can be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Progress has been made towards long term solutions to the algal blooms problem through a cooperative effort between the community, industrial consumers, land holders, government and local authorities within the catchment in consultation at the policy formulation stage. Long term strategies can be developed and refined as a much better understanding of the causes, extent and implications of the situation is gained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one set of measures will solve a problem of the complexity of the sustainability of Australia's water resources. Economic instruments such as pollution taxes, water entitlements, increased costs of water, strategies to reduce pollution sources and the possible reallocation of water licences will only partly address the problem and may only be appropriate in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Levies collected from irrigators, farmers and other water users should be spent on water resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a challenge to researchers to provide the urgently needed information on causes and cost effective treatment of algal blooms, on toxicology, the role of nutrients, riverine ecology and the effects of flow rates, the environmental value of water and the realistic appraisal of the impact of algal blooms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a challenge to the community, industry and governments to provide adequate funding and to use this information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accessible data bases for information are being developed which will assist researchers as well as inform the communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There should not be research for its own sake. There may be a tendency to keep researching in order to obtain the desired answers, rather than accepting obvious, though unpalatable results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emphasis must be on finding solutions, not apportioning blame, and communities may need to take hard decisions in the light of research findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although not all of the answers are known and there are still a number of areas which need to be addressed, basically the problems and the solutions are known. Most States/Territories now have the mechanisms in place, and only the political will is needed to provide the funding to carry them out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only reason for hesitation should be the importance of directing funding priorities to give the most impact to the problem.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>These regulations essentially relate to the workings of the parallel runway construction site at Sydney's Kingsford-Smith airport and the dredging sites in Botany Bay to ensure that environmental standards are complied with. The regulations also ensure that specific classes of state laws relating to environmental assessment and development approval processes do not apply to the parallel runway project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that those provisions could provide meat for sufficient argument to occupy the Senate for some time. I will not address the subject matter of the regulations. I merely state that it is my opinion&mdash;and I hope my opinion is shared by honourable senators&mdash;that the provision of runways, airport facilities for the landing of aircraft and for aviation exercises are precisely the sorts of issues that the Federal Airports Corporation should concern itself with. The thing that concerns me most&mdash;and I have consistently made this point&mdash;is that the Federal Airports Corporation has been required to address all manner of issues other than the safe passage of aircraft through our airports and the provision of infrastructure to allow this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulations that have been tabled are suitable concerns for the FAC to have. But since the government's change of attitude to the FAC and what it should be concerned with&mdash;that is, that it should be profit making venture conducted in the style of a corporation&mdash;the corporation now has to consider a number of other issues. In one annual report that I saw and commented on, the FAC thought that the management style of McDonald's, the take away food outlet, was an appropriate model for it to follow. I have never heard anything so ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attention of the FAC has been transferred from the provision of infrastructure to provide for the safe passage of aircraft to such questions as the licensed access of small off-airport car rental operators. For goodness sake, the amount of attention that the FAC has been required to give to that matter in negotiating with such bodies has distracted its attention from matters which are more appropriately within its purview. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of off-airport car rental operators should occupy the attention of other senators in this place. It is an issue which reveals the ineptitude of the FAC in pursuing commercial matters. It is a matter which has drawn the attention of the Prices Surveillance Authority. I think it should also have the attention of the Trade Practices Commission. What is revealed, after even a cursory examination of the FAC's activities in this area, is that the FAC is presuming to intervene in a commercial process of which it has very little understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC contends&mdash;and public statements have been made by officers of the Federal Airports Corporation&mdash;that somehow it is required to safeguard the commercial interests of those companies which have paid money to have virtual offices&mdash;desks, telephones and staff&mdash;within the airport terminals. The FAC contends that those companies, having invested in that way, should have their commercial interests protected by the actions of the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To me that smacks of protectionism. Today we have had great celebrations about free trade, GATT and goodness knows what else, and yet we have here a government instrumentality acting&mdash;supposedly at arm's length&mdash;under the guidance of the government's suggestion that a commercial, user-pays and profit seeking corporate attitude should be adopted by the FAC. In doing that, this body, which I think should rightly be concerned with provision of infrastructure, has become a negotiator for access to terminal space. Public statements have been made that it is the FAC's role to protect those who have paid considerable money to have office space at airport terminals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manner in which the FAC has chosen to protect such people or enterprises is to charge anybody else who has anything to do with car rental an exorbitant amount of money for access to the airport. People who have a legitimate enterprise in cities or elsewhere, who are located off airports, are charged to stand at the luggage area of the airport terminal. Anyone who has travelled by air anywhere in Australia would have seen in the luggage zone of airport terminals representatives of companies holding a sheet of paper with their pre-arranged client's name written on it, ready to meet the client. There is nothing offensive about that. Those people do not wear out a lot of carpet while they are standing there. When they meet their clients, they then conclude the business which has already been pre-arranged; in other words, they are shown to their cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes other business is conducted at airport terminals, and I am sure we all can imagine the sort of business that is conducted. One of those businesses impinges greatly upon us as members of parliament. Quite often a journalist or somebody wishing to ask for a comment on something will meet us. There are other styles of business. Overseas visitors may come to meet staff of Australian based corporations. We may see a public relations manager at the airport terminal holding up the name of the visitor. These meetings are conducted as a natural result of the airport being a place of transport intercourse. It is quite predictable that one would want to meet somebody at such a place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the so-called privilege of meeting the clients with whom they have already organised a contract, off-airport car rental operators are being charged a considerable amount of money by the Federal Airports Corporation in a manner which is not applied to any other business which meets clients at airports. We do not see taxi operators, chauffeurs of limousines, or bus operators being charged in such a way. We do not see any of the other businesses where persons meet persons being charged in such a way. I believe that this Senate ought to take time to notice that and to follow through the formal motion which was passed in this place only a few days ago. That motion required the minister to investigate this. Minister Collins has a duty to see that Australian citizens are not discriminated against in such a way&mdash;</PARA>

This is something that ought to be considered in great detail. I have attempted through notices of motion, questions, questions on notice and a formal motion in this place to bring this to the attention of the Australian people to illustrate how the Federal Airports Corporation is embarked on the wrong course at the direction of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Airports Corporation has thumbed its nose at the instructions, the beliefs and the impressions of the minister. A year ago Minister Collins received a delegation from the off-airport car rental operators. After receiving that delegation, the minister was able to agree with its point of view. He expressed support for the operators to be allowed access to Federal Airport Corporation terminals, as does every other person in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Prices Surveillance Authority agrees with the point of view of the off-airport car rental operators. The Prices Surveillance Authority found that the Federal Airports Corporation does not provide any tangible service to operators, and yet the operators are being asked to pay money. No tangible service is being provided. We know the extent of the service provided: one square foot of carpet to stand on for half an hour at the most. Yet the operators are being charged an exorbitant amount. I have taken the time of the Senate to point this out. I am not asking that anything else be done about it, but I have drawn attention to it by suggesting that these regulations that we have before us today are the appropriate direction of concern that the Federal Airports Corporation should be following&mdash;not this other area that it has ignorantly moved into. </PARA>

I happened to be on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations at that time. We were consulted about that draft proposal. Not only did I oppose that draft proposal for a regulation, but so did a majority of the Joint Committee on Migration Regulations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been quite intolerable for the parliament and for the Australian community to have allowed under the Migration Act a homosexual visa. That never fully came into public discussion until the minister now puts down a regulation that followed that discussion&mdash;and what the minister says is half correct&mdash;allowing immigration to this country where consideration can be given to a relationship between persons. That is all it says. It has nothing to do with any kind of definition of a homosexual relationship within a family; it has to do with the relationship between a niece or a nephew and a great aunt; between two elderly people, whether sisters, brothers, cousins or just people who work in the same place who have lived together for a long time and in which case, because one is involved in a family reunion or migrating to Australia, it is appropriate because of the relationship that that other person come to Australia.</PARA>

Whilst the minister has made references in the past that may have led someone in her own department or another department to give her this regulation under the Migration Act, it has no status with regard to definitions of family.

Frankly, the minister has got it absolutely all wrong. To use the migration regulations' definition of `family' in the context in which she has&mdash;at least this was the implication&mdash;is an absolute red herring. The definition of `family' in the migration regulations is that of close relationship between persons. The minister is saying that `family' means a close relationship between persons, without gender. In fact, the particular regulation which she quoted&mdash;I think it was class 814&mdash;is the interdependency visa, and the interdependency visa is expressly for homosexual couples. Senator Teague explained the reasons why such a visa was introduced. This has no bearing at all, as I understand it, on the definition of `family' in the context of this debate.

If the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) is not prepared to answer, then I presume that she pleads guilty by her silence to what she was attempting to do. The minister owes me an answer to a question concerning the definition of a `family' that I asked just before we adjourned at 7.30 p.m. on 24 November. Clause 5(2)(b)(iv) states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Then such a relationship is described at the bottom of the page. Bearing in mind the fact that the minister has always said that her prime concern is for the child&mdash;and Senator Lees has said the same&mdash;I asked her to tell me, just before we ran out of time, how a child in the care of persons in that situation would be treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, my main aim is to ask the minister how she defines, in that section, what sort of a relationship it is. When someone, presumably living in the household, is described as an ancestor or descendant of the other, or brother or sister, whether of whole blood or part-blood, how do we define whether or not there is a prohibited relationship? As I said previously, a brother and sister may be running a household for reasons I put forward the other day&mdash;the sister could be widowed, divorced or a single mother. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The definition in this legislation exactly parallels the definition under social security in these matters.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Panizza turns over the page of the definitions and looks at 5(3), he will see that there are a number of criteria as to how one can form an opinion about a relationship, if one needs to. That has been defined in that kind of way to try to balance an assessment about whether there is a relationship, with minimal need to interfere. That is the way those definitions are managed now under social security. I think there is no difference here from how it is dealt with under social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Temporary Chairman, I ask for your assistance here. I am happy to answer the honourable senator's question, but we have not actually moved to clause 5 yet. I think quite clearly we have been moving with the definition of `family' consequent upon my giving notice that, when it comes to clause 5, I will be moving an amendment on behalf of the government which will make clear what the definition of 5(1)(b) is by inserting a clause (ia) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a person is living with the other person and the other person is of the opposite sex.</PARA>

I do not know how to find out what sort of a relationship there is&mdash;as I said, it is very arbitrary and I do not want to go into it any further&mdash;but if the minister can explain that in the next section, will she please do so.

I think the minister, as Minister for Family Services, owes it to the chamber and the whole of Australia to get up here now and admit that what she said before lunch was incorrect and that she now, on reflection, considers that, so far as the so-called precedent of the migration regulations is concerned, that is not the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

He asked a range of questions pertinent to this legislation and he referred to claims that the minister had made&mdash;we can only assume in her personal capacity. But it is very difficult for the Australian public or this chamber to hear a minister of the government saying that what she is saying is in a personal capacity, or that her statements were in a personal capacity but they are no longer views that she holds in any capacity.

<PARA>The fact is that the minister's words to the Senate on 24 November were without precedent. Now she gets up and tells us that she was not really referring to families or couples; she was referring to part 305 of the migration regulations, which deals with interdependency, temporary visa, and exit and entry permits. I will not go through this matter, because Senator Jim Short, who knows a lot more about this than me&mdash;and probably most people in the parliament&mdash;has clearly stated that it has nothing whatsoever to do with the definition of family, much less including in that definition a one sex couple. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AMENDMENTS TO CHILDCARE REBATE BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is predicated on the argument that child care costs are a legitimate cost of earning income. It is therefore assumed that they ought to be deductible against income for tax purposes. This is the rationale advanced by the government for the view that child care is an economic issue, not a welfare issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first point to be made on this Bill is that it ought to be consistent with its rationale. It should ensure that child care costs are treated no less generously than a simple deduction for income earning costs under s 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I realize the government has proposed paying this tax-related measure as a cash rebate to cover those cases where taxpayers would be in training or study and thus have low incomes against which to claim a normal deduction. But that is no reason to treat taxpayers with child care costs less fairly than a large company with business expenses. The amendments I have circulated are designed to secure that result by eliminating the threshold for claims and the cap and to base the rebate on the marginal tax rate to be faced by most taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point to be made is that child care costs exist for every family&mdash;unless people here are willing to say that the labour of a spouse at home minding children is there for nothing. Too often, in talking about child care, people forget that parental child care is the basic form of child care&mdash;all other carers stand in loco parentis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, if child care is an expense of earning income for a woman acting a second earner in a family, it is equally a cost for a wage earner supporting a spouse caring for their children at home. The only reason this is not always seen is that we have a tendency to miss the obvious&mdash;we take for granted what has usually been the norm. But this is no reason to ignore what economists would describe as an implicit contract situation. Indeed, I note that in 1974 the Federal Treasury did observe that a tax deduction or rebate for child care did raise the question of the appropriate treatment for families where one spouse undertook the care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should also mention here that there are cases&mdash;often tragic&mdash;where one spouse works but has to pay for child care because the other spouse cannot do it. A spouse may be dying, suffer from schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis or some other mental or physical disability. In these circumstances, the employment of a carer for the children (or indeed the spouse at home) is just as much a work related expense as in the two income case assumed in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Households can organise their labour supply in various ways. They can opt for having 2 earners with external child care or they can opt for having one earner undertaking to pay the other&mdash;whether explicitly or implicitly, whether in cash or in kind&mdash;for providing child care so the other spouse can work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, in family law it is well recognised that the contribution of a non-earning spouse to the earning of income or the accumulation of assets by the other can be substantial. As Lord Denning remarked in 1952 "A wife is no longer her husband's chattel. She is beginning to be regarded by the law as a partner in all affairs which are their common concern." Sir Jocelyn Simon put it more colourfully when he said "the cock bird can feather his nest precisely because he is not required to spend most of his time sitting on it." Thus the Family Law Act in s 79 requires the Court to take into account "the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by . . . a party . . . to the acquisition . . . of the property . . . .". It makes the point even clearer by directing the Court to take into account non-financial contributions "including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If family law recognises the implicit contract involved in one parent undertaking to care for children so the other can earn an income, there is no reason why in principle this Bill should not recognise it also. Even if one were to take the view that a spouse's care of a child should normally be regarded as a duty owed to the other spouse without reward or payment, you can still see cases where one spouse's care of the children may be seen as above and beyond a 9 to 5 duty. For example, one spouse may well want to compensate another for extra care undertaken when he or she has to attend to work out of hours. We hear a great deal from the government about level playing fields. I would like to see a level playing field in child care. It is really a rather discriminatory situation&mdash;indeed, it is a sort of sexist discrimination on the grounds of marital status&mdash;if we are to say that a spouse cannot claim the child care rebate for payments for child care made to another spouse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On principle the tax system and this rebate system should be neutral between different family choices in regard to labour force participation. We should not discriminate against one income families by saying they will get a less than $2.85 increase per week in the home child care allowance, while others will get up to $61.20 per week. I might add the $2.85 per week has already probably been gobbled up by the sales tax and petrol tax increases pushed through in the Budget and I note that, unlike other low income earners, the spouse at home did not get an extra rebate to compensate even in part for the extra tax burden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that we can consider more carefully the sorts of biases we are introducing into our social arrangements through disguised tax penalties. I feel this Bill is a useful place to start questioning the unstated but plain assumption that spouses caring for children at home are not working and are not contributing to the ability of their partners to earn income through paid work.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Clause 28, page 11, line 27, omit "each parental", substitute "a parental".</PARA>
<PARA>It is too harsh to insist that both parents must be in the paid work force to be able to claim the child-care rebate. Work related child-care expenses can occur when only one parent is earning an income. I would like the minister to focus on this example: a spouse at home is suffering from terminal cancer or schizophrenia or another mental or physical illness. One illness that readily comes to mind is the early stages of MS&mdash;multiple sclerosis. The spouse in paid employment has to pay for child care and spouse care before he or she can go out and earn an income. The social security system will income test this family out of any benefit on the basis of the earning spouse's income. Yet child care in such case is clearly just as much a cost of earning an income as in the two-income case assumed by the bill in its present form. What justification can there be for denying the child-care rebate to such a taxpayer, especially when it is remembered that such a family will have a lower disposable income and an extra dependant compared with the vast majority of families? There are other less dramatic examples. Suppose two spouses are in the paid work force using external child care and one gets a posting overseas for three months. They may agree that one will pay the other to care for the children on a paid basis in lieu of employment for the period. Another example would be where a spouse who undertakes night shift works and pays the other for the extra burden of care required. Child-care centres are not available at night. The labour of the spouse in caring for children in such circumstances is just as much a cost of earning a family income as if the children were cared for elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At law, husbands and wives are free to contract with each other as much as anyone else for child care. It is wrong to assume that the labour of a spouse is available for nothing. If couples adopt a contractual basis for child care there is no double dipping possible on the home child-care allowance. Any amounts paid are a reward for services and are taxable as income. The home child-care allowance is reduced by any such earned income. Take the case of the spouse who is a family day carer on a part-time basis. There are a number of examples which I will not go into.</PARA>

<PARA>These clauses in the Childcare Rebate Bill to which I am making the requests limit the rebate for child-care expenses and they all need to be replaced. They limit the recognition of child-care costs in three fundamentally illogical ways. First, the minimum weekly threshold amount of expenditure is ignored as a cost of earning income which, as I noted in my address to the previous request, is totally illogical. It also discriminates against families who are likely to be on lower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, there is discrimination against families with more than two children in care. They have extra costs for the third child and any additional children, but the clauses which I am requesting the House of Representatives to omit do not recognise the extra costs for the third child and other children. These are not recognised as costs of earning an income because of the limit imposed by section 44(3). That is a discrimination against people with more than two children in child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, the rebate is fixed at only 30c in the dollar. For many families the extra amount of tax imposed on additional income is not 30c in the dollar but 34c in the dollar. For some earners the marginal tax rate could be even higher&mdash;up to 47c. When account is taken of the Medicare levy of 1.4c in the dollar, additional income for many families may be taxed from 35.4c in the dollar up to 48.4c in the dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acknowledged that the rebate is being paid outside the tax system to cover cases such as students who may not yet have an income, but that is no reason to treat taxpayers less fairly than in the case of other work-related deductions. Since the bulk of full-time workers are likely to be paying a tax at a marginal rate of 35.4c in the dollar by next year&mdash;and if there is a jobs levy they could be paying 40.4c in the dollar&mdash;the rebate should be calculated to more fairly reflect tax burdens on additional income. At this stage, I believe that that should be calculated at 35.4 per cent of the total weekly child-care expenditure. While this is not fully fair to the taxpayers on higher incomes, at least it is fair to most persons who will be claiming the child-care rebate. </PARA>

We believe there would be very few families with more than two children under the age of five in care. We see that it might encourage families to seek very expensive child care and, of course, they would generally be families on high incomes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the amendment that we are being asked to agree to is, in effect, the House of Representatives' rejection of the amendment we made to the bill here in the Senate, which was to remove the $50 million minimum threshold level for projects for the motor vehicle industry and the print media. That amendment to remove the $50 million lower limit for projects to qualify under the Investment Development Allowance Authority Bill was moved by the coalition and supported by the Democrats when the bill was before the Senate in September and early October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without taking too much of the committee's time, the chronology was as follows: the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill was introduced here by the government a few months ago to extend the development allowance&mdash;this was contained in the original Development Allowance Authority Bill&mdash;to projects in the motor vehicle and printing production industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the original Development Allowance Authority Bill was introduced in 1992&mdash;it had its genesis in the government's One Nation statement&mdash;it provided a tax deduction of 10 per cent on eligible plant during the first year of installation or use. Eligible projects were to have a capital cost of over $50 million and be approved by a special statutory authority called the Development Allowance Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the original bill came in, we on this side of the Senate had difficulty with the $50 million figure below which projects would not qualify for this special allowance because we felt that it discriminated against small and medium sized business. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in gaining the support of the Democrats, in particular, for the carriage of an amendment to remove the $50 million lower threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when the amendment bill came back here as one of the budget bills for 1993&mdash;I think it was one of the budget bills; it was debated here as part of the budget process&mdash;to extend the original bill to cover the motor industry and the print media, which had not been included in the first bill, for reasons that are difficult to comprehend, the second time around we did get the support of the minor parties. As a result of that, we found the odd situation, which we are now debating, whereby the Senate approved the abolition of the $50 million lower limit for the motor industries and print media projects but retained, by virtue of the original bill, the $50 million lower threshold for everything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have always had difficulties with that lower threshold. First, it discriminates against projects with a capital cost of less than $50 million. Second, it did nothing for investment in plant and equipment in the poorest areas of the economy that most needed fixing. The original problem arose because the government, as is now its wont, did not think it all through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the One Nation statement was supposed to encourage investment in plant and equipment and in investment generally to get this economy going&mdash;at that stage the economy was in desperate straits so far as its depressed condition was concerned&mdash;the putting in of a $50 million lower limit to qualify for the investment allowance did nothing at all to help the small and medium sized companies and ventures. They were the ones that really needed helping. In that sense it was a classic example of this government's absolute lack of understanding of what was needed to get economic recovery going. It is quite ridiculous for the government just to concentrate its efforts in getting the big boys in the economy going if, in the process, it will disadvantage and do nothing at all to encourage small and medium size ventures to get going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have always had this problem with the $50 million lower project limit. Frankly, we were somewhat surprised that we got support the second time round in relation to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill when the proposal was extended to cover the motor industry and the print media, which had been excluded the first time round. We got support from the minor parties the second time round on getting rid of the $50 million lower limit, although we did not get it the first time round. That in itself created an anomaly which the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) quite rightly pointed out earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate's amendment to the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill that we are now discussing had been accepted by the House of Representatives, then we would have had the distinction whereby motor industry and print media projects would not have had any lower threshold at all, whereas everything else would have had the $50 million lower threshold. That is inconsistent and we accept that. But I would have to say that the whole process, which finished up in a mess, was due entirely to the government's incompetence in the first instance in putting in that threshold at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reluctantly, the coalition will accept the government's amendment in the House of Representatives; namely, to reject our initial proposal to abolish the $50 million limit. We will not press our amendment. However, we do think that our original position is correct in the sense that if the government is really serious about getting this economy going again and about providing encouragement and support to those sectors of the private sector that are the lifeblood of this country, which is small and medium size business, then it would not have allowed itself to get into this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that this government, firstly, is totally incompetent in economic policy making and economic management; and, secondly, that arises in important degree because of an ideological mind-set against small and medium size business in this country. I think the only reason why that is the case flows from the fact that this government, without exception throughout our history, is a corporatist government. It believes that the only way to get things done is to do deals between big government here in Canberra and big business and big unions. So far as small and medium size businesses are concerned, they can go hang and the devil take the hindmost with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We totally reject that approach. That was why we adopted the attitude and the situation towards these bills that we did. Having said that, we will not press to retain the Senate's amendment that was moved the first time round because we do understand the anomalies that it produces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion I want to stress two points that come out of all of this. The first is the government's absolute disregard for the needs of small and medium size business in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill proposes amendments to a number of Acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister and to other legislation dealing with matters relevant to the Prime Minister's portfolio. Details of the various amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill. I will deal only with the more important aspects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Archives Act 1983 relating to access to documents known as Cabinet notebooks. The Archives Act will be amended to provide a clear and sensible archival mechanism that, for the first time, will allow public access to notebooks recording the deliberations of Cabinet after a period of fifty years. At the same time, Cabinet notebooks will be protected from access under the Freedom of Information Act during that period. While these Acts do not fall within the portfolio responsibilities of the Prime Minister, the amendments are included in this portfolio bill because of the Prime Minister's responsibility for the Cabinet process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, honourable Senators may be aware that, on 16 December 1992, amendments to the Archives Act, the Freedom of Information Act and the Evidence Act were introduced into the House of Representatives in a bill titled the Cabinet Notebooks (Access and Protection) Bill 1992. That bill lapsed on the calling of the last federal election in March. An explanation of the Cabinet notetaking system was included in the second-reading speech accompanying that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In April 1993 the High Court handed down its decision in relation to the appeal by the Commonwealth against a decision of the Full Court of the Federal Court in the case of the Northern Land Council v Commonwealth in which the Council sought access to a number of Cabinet notebooks from the 1970s. While not finding that there is an absolute immunity from production of Cabinet notebooks in court proceedings, the High Court found that there were "extremely strong" considerations of public policy weighing against their production. Only exceptional circumstances, such as non-disclosure impeding defendants  in the conduct of their defence or allegations of serious misconduct on the part of Cabinet Ministers, should justify disclosure in such proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of this decision, the Government has decided that it is unnecessary at the present time to include provisions regulating the use of Cabinet notebooks in court proceedings in the Evidence Act or the proposed Evidence Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill also implements the Government's December 1992 response to the Report of the Review of the Office of the Ombudsman by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. In line with the recommendations of the Standing Committee, the major amendments to the Act will:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">give the Ombudsman jurisdiction to investigate administrative actions of federal court registries and Commonwealth parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">give the Ombudsman a discretion to decline to investigate or to cease investigating commercial activities of Commonwealth agencies; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">allow the Ombudsman to transfer complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Merit Protection and Review Agency or an industry ombudsman, where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the amendments to implement the Government's response to the Senate Standing Committee's report, a number of other minor amendments to the Ombudsman Act will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill also includes amendments to the Public Service Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976 to enable effect to be given to the Government's decision to allow secretaries of departments and a limited number of equivalent-level statutory office-holders to relinquish their continuing tenure in the public service, and the value which attaches to that tenure, in return for a reasonable loading on their salaries being set by the Remuneration Tribunal.  (The Government has recommended to the Tribunal that the loading should be set at 20 per cent.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes we are making are a natural evolution of the changes made 10 years ago when the Parliament removed the right to tenure in particular departmental head positions and the policy of rotations on a five year basis was introduced.  Enabling secretaries of departments to choose whether to retain their tenure in the public service or to relinquish it in return for a salary loading is a logical progression which has taken place in many other public services both here and overseas.  Even with the loading, which will be set by the independent Remuneration Tribunal, the remuneration of Commonwealth heads of departments, with their national level responsibilities, will not match that of their counterparts in Victoria and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In sharpening the focus on the policy of rotation by making greater use of fixed-term appointments, the Government will continue to retain the traditional virtues of the public service with the emphasis there has always been on having heads of departments with great personal integrity, political impartiality and preparedness to offer the frank and fearless advice we expect of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes other amendments of a minor nature to the Public Service Act 1922 to ensure that the Act adequately reflects the requirements of contemporary public sector administration. For example, amendments are included relating to the discipline process, excess officers, Joint Selection Committees and the mobility provisions of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discipline process as it relates to unattached officers will be brought more into line with the process that applies in relation to other officers. The amendments reflect the recommendations of the Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in December 1992 on its inquiry into the management of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments relating to excess officers will ensure that the appeal mechanism available to excess officers in relation to transfers is only available to those excess officers who have applied for transfer to a position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments will allow for the use of a Joint Selection Committee order of merit in filling identical and subsequent vacancies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of minor or technical amendments to a number of other Acts. Details of these are set out in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 proposes some changes to the act. Due to the implementation of the guillotine in the other place, this is the first opportunity that has arisen in the parliament for any debate on this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to amend two acts&mdash;namely, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991. Briefly, what is proposed is that first of all amendments be made to section 52, division 8 of part III, and section 5J in regard to assessing allocated pensions and annuities according to the managed investment rules for the purpose of the income and assets test. Managed investments is a loose term generally used to describe market linked and capital guaranteed investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market linked investments are subject to fluctuations in value because of market forces, for example, friendly society bonds, public unit trusts and certain approved deposit funds. If an investment is unlikely to decrease in value through market fluctuations, it is regarded as an accruing return investment or a capital investment, and this sort of investment includes insurance bonds, approved deposit funds and deferred annuities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allocated pensions are a type of retirement investment that pays a retiree a regular income each year in return for a lump sum investment, and annuities are another retirement investment product with a life office which treats the original capital differently. The second change is the inclusion of shares and securities listed on any stock exchange other than an Australian stock exchange in subsection 5J(1) of the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third change is the extension of children of veterans or members of the Australian Defence Force in receipt of extreme disability adjustment through an amendment to section 116 of the principal act. The fourth and final amendment is to extend the sunset clause for the payment of advance pharmaceutical allowance for a further 12 months through an amendment to section 17 of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1991 and section 118F of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the extension of advance pharmaceutical allowance, the opposition has no difficulty with this extension and will be supporting it. The payment of this allowance is an advance of up to seven fortnights worth of a person's pharmaceutical allowance, and it is to the advantage of those who are chronically ill or those who, due to some illness, require a large volume of medication. To repeal this without ensuring that some alternative mechanism is in place could seriously disadvantage some veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Similarly, the opposition will be supporting the extension of eligibility of the veterans' children education scheme to the children of veterans or force members in receipt of extreme disability adjustment. Currently, only the children of a deceased veteran who was on an EDA, extreme disability adjustment, may receive this assistance. This amendment is logical and fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal act contains a number of such cases where a particular pension or benefit becomes available on the death of the veteran. Yet it is very likely the awarding of additional assistance to the spouse or dependant would be particularly helpful during the remaining life of the veteran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A point of contention for us is the allocated pensions and annuities. The opposition will not be supporting the amendments concerning the assessment of allocated pensions and annuities according to the managed investment rules; nor will the opposition be supporting the change to the definition of `shares' and listed securities. We oppose these changes for one clear and simple reason&mdash;that is, that an inquiry has been established by the government, thanks to pressure from the opposition, into retirement incomes and means testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This review into retirement income streams and means testing of retirement incomes, which the opposition has said we would undertake when in government, is long overdue. The need for this review has become more apparent with the government's controversial treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares and investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has put amendments to the government draft terms of reference and these have been accepted. We believe that the terms of reference needed to be more focused. The opposition also believe the view needed to reflect that any retirement or incomes policy needs to expand and maximise incentive for self-provision. Hopefully this review will get under way as soon as possible as the inequity of some of the government's ad hoc schemes for saving money needs to be exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of current policy of the government, we have the situation where veteran service pensions and social security aged pensioners are being actively discouraged from trying to provide for themselves, even partially, during their retirement years. Additionally, the treatment of retirement packages such as allocated pensions by the tax office and the Department of Social Security is different. In his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Security in retirement</EMPHASIS> paper issued in June last year, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced that the government was endorsing allocated pensions. He indicated that the taxation treatment afforded to traditional life office annuities would be extended to allocated pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer at that stage also acknowledged the flexible nature of allocated pensions. He recognised the important role allocated pensions could play in encouraging Australians to look to income streams rather than lump sums. Yet within a couple of weeks of this statement being released by the Treasurer, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) made a public announcement of proposals which would have a detrimental impact on people who had taken the Treasurer's statement to heart for the Minister of Social Security's announcement ensured people who invested in allocated pensions would be penalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult for people to prepare for their retirement when the rules are changing so constantly. But it is dishonest when statements encouraging the taking up of a particular scheme are made by one minister and statements announcing the retirement scheme is to become a milch cow are made by another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the vexed question of the formula which is being used to calculate the amount of income which is being earned. I have received many letters&mdash;as I am sure have many of my colleagues in this chamber&mdash;which show quite clearly that the amount the person actually receives and the amount the Department of Veterans' Affairs assesses them to have received is quite different. In some cases that amount is quite small. In some cases, dependent on the amount invested and the type of investment, it can be quite substantial. Ultimately, the point is that the pension is being reduced according to an amount of money which has not being received by the pensioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the case of those people who invested a certain amount of capital and investment last decade and saw the value of that investment decline dramatically because of the prevailing economic circumstances at the time. Many of those investments are now starting to recover and their face value is improving. But in most cases that improvement is not with regard to the purchase price of the original investment. All we have seen is an improvement in the current market price of those investments as opposed to the immediate past. But according to the government this is a real benefit to the beneficial owner and it is being assessed as capital growth. That is totally without logic or any fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point must be stressed because it represents one of the main anomalies in the system of calculation the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security are using. For many pensioners the value of their income units is still less than what they originally paid for them. But because of the listing of the units on the stock exchange and their gradual recovery in price, pensioners are being assessed at a high rate despite the fact that they have still not recovered to their purchase price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security are making a paper assessment, which is reducing pensions to such a level that some pensioners are having to sell part of their investment in order to regain some real as opposed to notional income. In many cases these units are being sold at a loss. It is quite absurd to call this an act of policy of encouraging people to provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfairness and the anomalies under the present means test are affecting an estimated 200,000 pensioners who hold managed investments and who have been receiving assessments under the same unfair scheme since March. In September this year 55,670 pensioners had their pensions decreased because of a reassessment by the Department of Social Security. This resulted in a net saving for the government of $1.055 million per fortnight. In July, almost 35,000 social security pensioners experienced a pension decrease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To propose the changes we are dealing with in this bill at this time is unacceptable. We believe that there can be no more fiddling around the edges of the retirement income and means testing system until the inquiry into retirement incomes and means testing has completed its investigation, made its recommendations and the report is thoroughly studied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is aware that these amendments mirror amendments proposed under the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1992, which has been passed as act No. 230 of 1993. The income and assets test for service pensions under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and for aged pensions under the Social Security Act have always been identical tests. They have been identical as essentially each of these pensions was designed to meet a similar purpose&mdash;the provision of retirement income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) was debated in the Senate, it was resolved to have the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation inquire into the changes in the treatment of allocated pensions and annuities for social security purposes. The actual wording of the reference to the committee was that it was to inquire into and report on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the likely effect of the changes in the treatment of allocated pensions and annuities for social security purposes contained in Division 19 of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 1992&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The superannuation committee has spent quite some time on this reference. It has received considerable evidence of the hazards of treating allocated pensions as managed investments for social security purposes. Yet, irrespective of the evidence presented to or recommendations of the committee, the minister has announced that the changes to the social security treatment of allocated pensions will commence as soon as the report has been presented by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, the chairman of the superannuation committee, Senator Watson, announced that the committee would be preparing a paper for the Minister for Social Security before presenting its report to the Senate. Senator Watson estimates that the report will be tabled during the autumn sittings next year. Irrespective of the weight of evidence presented, the minister intends to proceed with the changes. The minister should wait until the committee has reported and until the matter has been discussed in the Senate, but Mr Baldwin insists on charging ahead. Regrettably, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs intends to follow Mr Baldwin down the same path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the review finds, as the Senate superannuation committee apparently has, that there are hazards in treating allocated pensions as managed investments, then the government may be forced to move additional amendments to clean up the system. In the meantime, many pensioners will have been forced to sell at a loss to ensure that they receive some real, as opposed to notional, capital gain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the matter of the considerable inconvenience that the government will be imposing on elderly veterans for possibly a short period of time. Along with the legislative changes come the actual mechanisms for assessing investment income and, therefore, the amount of service pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here is a massive, inconvenient and costly amount of paperwork. It is massive both for the department and for the veteran. It is costly for the department and the veterans, who have to prepare and copy and phone investment houses and so on to come to an assessment of what their investment is worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is the inconvenience. Elderly people are being asked to check and report every couple of months. If we know anything about elderly people at all, we know that they dislike change; they particularly detest constant change. The lack of consistency in their planning, the worry and the uncertainty that comes from this all adds to the stress on elderly Australians and they should not be subjected to these pressures. They should not be subjected to constant change and the inherent anxiety that comes from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If some of the bureaucrats that put this scheme up to the minister had any knowledge or contact with the elderly of this community, they would realise the truth of what I am saying. I am sure they would not propose this constant change and the uncertainty that brings on the elderly people who intellectually, mentally and emotionally do not have the resources to cope with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will also be opposing the change to include overseas share markets and not just shares that are listed securities on the Australian Stock Exchange. Until the review is complete, a stop has to be put at some stage to any more changes to the system. The opposition will be more than happy to reconsider this amendment after the findings and the recommendations have been made by the review committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has no intention of being a party to any more changes to the system while it remains a pasted together series of amendments and mechanisms which are all aimed at collecting dollars rather than providing fairness, equity and simplicity for those no longer in the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, we are ill-disposed to accept unnecessary tax on the incomes of the veterans of this nation. The changes to the managed investment area have impacted quite heavily on many service pensioners, pensioners who served this nation in time of war and, as such, qualified for this pension. Veterans have also felt the impact of the changes in regard to unrealised capital gains on shares and listed securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister is proposing here is that the trigger for the commencement of the assessment of allocated pensions and annuities, according to the managed investment rules, will be the tabling of the superannuation committee's report. It does not seem to matter what the contents of that report might be and it does not seem to matter to the minister that the review of retirement incomes and means testing will be also under way. Nor does it matter that the independent review might come down with a series of recommendations which could drastically change the system again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going to come out of all of this is an area of great uncertainty and great stress for those elderly veterans who simply cannot cope with it. The opposition therefore will be opposing these moves. In the quest for a more certain economic environment for the veterans of this nation, we will be opposing those amendments. We hope that the Democrats and the Green senators will join us in helping to provide a more certain and more predictable environment for Australian veterans. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Chairman, I am not going to take up much of the Senate time because we still have so much to get through.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Democrats have no problem with two of the measures in this bill, in fact we welcome them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, we are pleased to see the extension of benefits under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme to the children of veterans who receive Extreme Disablement Adjustment, which was announced in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also believe it is sensible to extend the operation of Advance Pharmaceutical Allowance for a further twelve months. This up-front payment is valuable to those who have a need for a large number of prescription items and it should be continued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the measure to change the definition of "shares and listed securities". The Democrats are strongly of the opinion that we in this place have interfered too much in the incomes of retirees over the last few years. Some of the measures have been beneficial, but more often, all the government has done is reduce benefits, and to add insult to injury, combine that reduction with copious amounts of paperwork which serve only to worry and confuse people as they get to a stage in their lives when they don't cope so well with change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, it is our view that there should be no retrospective changes to age pensions. People who have already made the financial arrangements for their retirement in good faith should not have to cope with changes. We must stop sending the message to pensioners that no matter how carefully they invest their retirement income, we are quite likely to change the rules down the track to their disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We in the Democrats were very much opposed to the latest assault in pensioner income, that is the assessment of unrealised gains on stock and shares for income purposes. The Senate will remember that we voted against this legislation when it came before us in December last year. Unfortunately, it passed through this chamber with the support of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measure then went to the Senate Community Affairs Committee and it soon became obvious that there was country-wide opposition. The Democrats collected more than 7,500 signatures on petitions which we presented in this place. As we all know now, the government was forced to back down on the retrospective element in the bill but unfortunately we were left with this unfair measure for those pensioners who bought shares after August 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now we have yet another change&mdash;this time to bring veterans legislation in line with social security legislation. The Democrats will not vote against this particular part of the bill because I can see that it does make sense that we don't send signals to veterans that they should divest themselves of their Australian shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as Allocated Pensions are concerned, this is not just a little measure to put things right as is the change in definition of shares and listed securities. This is a very big change indeed for veterans' retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats are not going to support this provision. We voted against the corresponding provision in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act when it came before the Senate in December of last year and we have not changed our minds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the matter of Allocated Pensions was considered by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, my colleague, Senator Kernot, put in a dissenting report stating that the vast majority of allocated pension holders would be assessed to be receiving more income than they actually  received, with a consequent reduction in pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter was referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and I understand that this committee is due to report in March 1994. I therefore ask why we cannot wait for the report of the committee before we do anything further to retirement incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that the date of commencement for this provision is tied to the commencement of the corresponding provision in the Social Security legislation and will not operate retrospectively. However, if we agree to this measure now, surely we are assuming that the findings of the committee will have no impact on the government's intentions on retirement incomes, no matter what recommendations are made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, we will be loading veterans with yet more worry about their pensions now, and we could well be looking at further changes in the autumn after the committee has reported. As I said earlier, retirees have had so many changes to the treatment of their income of the last few years, it is simply not fair to present them with more changes which might not be necessary. We should wait just a few months for the committee to report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In October this year the government announced an independent review of the income and assets test for service and social security pensions. The opposition wants to delay any amendment to the income and assets test until the review hands down its recommendations. Senator MacGibbon made that clear in his contribution. There may even be one or two arguments for that. However, where there is clearly an anomaly that will result in inconsistency in the treatment of social security, or where change is beneficial to pensioners, I do not believe that as a responsible government we ought to wait what could be anything up to a couple of years. That would be an extraordinary position for any government to adopt&mdash;and, I would have thought, for any opposition to adopt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems likely that the results of the review will take perhaps the best part of two years to become law. The independent review will hand down its report in September next year. The government's response will be considered in the context of the 1995-96 budget and announced in the budget. The drafting of any amending bill, the passage of such a bill through the parliament and the ultimate enactment all take time. The pensioners allegedly being protected by the opposition's tactics are those pensioners who can best afford to fund their own retirement and not rely on government support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is keen on not making any major changes until the review has reported, but the result of the opposition blocking these amendments will be a piecemeal and inconsistent approach to pension assessment by creating differences and maintaining anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993, which was introduced into the House of Representatives, contains a number of amendments to the income and assets test. These changes are minor in nature but are beneficial to the pensioner. I wonder how the opposition might react to those beneficial changes while awaiting the findings of a review. In the interests of moving through this quickly, that is all I plan to say at this time, but at a later stage I want to make a couple of comments about what would be the impact of the opposition's position on this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minor amendment to the definition of shares and other listed securities ensures that the income and assets tests apply to both foreign sourced investments and Australian ones. The measure does not directly relate to matters recently debated in the public arena and in the parliament. It corrects an anomaly and addresses concerns that the current definition would adversely affect the Australian investment industry by encouraging pensioners to divest themselves of their Australian shareholdings in preference to overseas ones.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns in fact were raised by Senator MacGibbon during his second reading speech for the private member's bill he introduced on 10 May this year dealing with the treatment of shares and listed securities. He indicated at that time that he was concerned about the movements of investors offshore. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also a strong argument that this proposal could have the effect of moving many small investors offshore. The Australian Stock Exchange has pointed out that unrealised capital gains on investments on overseas stock exchanges would not be subject to the veterans' affairs income test. The Australian Stock Exchange has made considerable headway recently in attracting small investors into the local share market. This proposal has the potential to discourage small scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is desperately needed.</PARA>
<PARA>So I do think there is an element of hypocrisy in the approach that is being taken by the opposition. As soon as the government tries to amend the act to ensure that this anomaly does not occur and to ensure that the treatment of shares and listed securities is consistent with provisions of the Social Security Act, the opposition does what it probably does best of all&mdash;opposes it. I think reasoning and fairness and consistency in treatment and consistency in argument has been forgotten on this matter. I support this clause of the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can remember talking to one of my colleagues many years ago and I asked, `What sort of an organisation is such-and-such university?' and he said, `It all depends on who the dean is'. He said that leaders set the style and the pattern for an organisation. In the case of the government which has a leader like Mr Keating, who is totally irrational and who is governed by his emotions&mdash;never by reason&mdash;I suppose one could expect the sort of statement that we have just heard from Senator Faulkner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Faulkner had been endowed with the usual auditory apparatus and the cerebral links to interpret what he had heard, he would have realised that I had made it specifically clear that I was not defending investments in overseas exchanges. I was using the argument that we, on this side of the chamber, have had enough of the constant change, the insecurity, and the emotional trauma that comes from this government changing the legislation so that elderly Australians have their retirement income packages attacked constantly, month after month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition opposes the clause on overseas investment on the basis that, until the government thinks through of what ground rules it wants for retirement income policies for Australians, we are not prepared to countenance any further mindless change&mdash;particularly of an ad hoc nature. My personal view, and the view of my colleagues, is that we would prefer all Australians to invest their money in Australia. We certainly do not encourage anyone to invest overseas. We believe that the interests of all Australians are served by putting money here. I counsel the minister very carefully to try to listen and to try to understand what we, on this side of the chamber, are saying, because we do think about what we are saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The impact of the amendment which was carried in the committee stage&mdash;and of this subsequent amendment, if carried&mdash;will be that this bill will not be accepted by the House of Representatives in its amended form. The failure to pass this bill&mdash;this is what Senator MacGibbon will be responsible for&mdash;will mean that the proposal to extend the VCES benefits to children of EDA veterans will not proceed. The sunset clause controlling the operation of advanced pharmaceutical allowance will come into effect and will repeal this provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This calendar year approximately 250 advance pharmaceutical payments were made. If this bill does not pass the Senate this week, no further payments of advance pharmaceutical allowance can be made after 1 January 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security has similar advance pharmaceutical allowance payments. The sunset clause for the social security payments has been extended. Therefore, a failure to pass the extension of this sunset clause in this bill will again result in inconsistencies between the two departments. In relation to VCES benefits to children of veterans who are severely disabled&mdash;those with the most extreme disabilities&mdash;this will mean that an estimated 32 grants of benefits under the scheme will not proceed. I must say to Senator MacGibbon and the opposition that I am afraid the opposition will be responsible for that. Fatuous, false and hypocritical arguments have been put forward in support of the amendments moved in the committee stage of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the coalition will, of course, support the advance pharmaceutical allowance issue&mdash;it will let that one go through to the keeper. But the impact will be that it will not go ahead because amendments to other parts of the bill will not be accepted in the House of Representatives. A service pensioner can only access the advance payment if he or she has ordinary income of less than $20 a fortnight. A failure to pass that part of the bill&mdash;which will be the impact of what we are talking about here&mdash;will affect service pensioners who can least afford to pay for the prescription co-payment from their pensions. That is something for which the opposition will stand condemned. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that Senator Faulkner put forward simply will not stand up in political terms. If he feels that there are now anomalies in relation to the treatment of veterans, it is within his power to introduce a bill to correct those anomalies; nothing could be simpler.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues on both sides have encouraged me to limit my remarks to a few minutes and to address specifically in the committee stage those amendments which I have every expectation will be successful. Despite admirable speeches by my colleagues in the House of Representatives, where there is an iron majority for the government of the day, the government always wins in that place. However, with education bills it is possible for a coalition spokesman, a Democrat spokesman and occasionally a spokesman from one of the other minorities in the Senate to come together and pass amendments that make sensible improvements for the benefit of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition expresses support for these two bills but it will propose one significant amendment. The bills provide funding for technical and further education programs&mdash;these days, they are more often called vocational education or adult education programs. These programs bring real benefits to hundreds of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that my close colleague, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), is in the gallery. He has spoken on technical and further education&mdash;vocational education&mdash;in the House of Representatives and other places around the country. He has done so with discernment and careful preparation. I look forward throughout this parliament to our working together to put pressure upon this government, where we can be convincing, to see improvements made for the benefit of Australians. As I have said in earlier speeches, frankly, the only remedy will be a change of government. That is what is needed to see a real improvement in technical and further education, and higher education in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill transfers certain national programs from the Commonwealth to the Australian National Training Authority&mdash;ANTA&mdash;which has its secretariat in Brisbane and which will operate fully from the first day of next month. It has been 18 months in preparation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My views and the opposition's views were expressed at the time of ANTA's establishment. Despite our scepticism and our not being fully convinced by the centralising arguments of the Labor Party to take over some of the responsibilities and initiatives of the states, we saw merit in support for the ANTA initiative. We will continue to monitor ANTA to ensure that it is not just another layer of bureaucracy which soaks up taxpayers' money but that it will, month by month, lead to outcomes in every state of Australia that are of benefit to the technical and further education of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANTA bill corrects a minor drafting problem contained in the original act. This is more evidence&mdash;we see it all the time these days&mdash;of the sloppiness of the Labor Party in preparing its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill provides supplementation funding for the TAFE sector in the 1993-95 triennium in accordance with movements in price indices. This is quite routine legislation and we support these elements of that legislation. From 1 January funding for TAFE moves to a rolling triennium. It is a situation which I and the opposition welcome. It is a positive strength to planning for this sector of education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one particular aspect of this legislation that the opposition will oppose and I will be moving amendments to it in the committee stage. At the last minute an amendment was moved by Minister Beazley in the House of Representatives debate which arrogated unilaterally&mdash;without consultation with the States&mdash;a power to the Commonwealth minister to veto funding to the states. This unilateral veto of the Commonwealth, without consultation with the states, took the states, ANTA and certainly this parliament by surprise. The numbers in the House of Representatives ensured that the amendment got through. Here in the Senate we will try to remove the provision which would give the minister the power under this ANTA legislation to veto any funding for technical and further education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee stage I will refer to letters I received from the Western Australian Minister for Education, Mr Moore, the Tasmanian Minister for Education and the Arts, Mr Beswick, the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Storey, and the New South Wales Minister for Education, Mrs Chikarovski. I will incorporate the letters received from those ministers, setting out their dismay at this Labor government's taking the states by surprise. I believe the government has broken the original agreement between the Commonwealth and the states which was very finely balanced to allow ministerial council supervision of ANTA and of all the funding mechanisms with regard to vocational education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time allowed to me by my colleagues has elapsed. I will conclude by again commending my colleague the honourable member for Menzies who, in a longer speech in the House of Representatives, was able to set out more positively the constructive ideas of the Liberal and National parties with regard to this area of education. In great contrast to the present government's inadequate management of these matters, we want to initiate a fresh approach which will see much improved outcomes for Australians in technical and further education. I will have much more to say in the committee stage of the debate. </PARA>

The Australian Democrats have long supported the development of a uniform and disciplined national training sector in this country. The announcement of the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority in July 1992 was a welcome move. It formalised a coordinated and national approach to training for both TAFEs and private providers in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANTA forms an important part of the new national training system, along with the ministerial council and a network of training authorities. It symbolises the strengthening of links with business and industry in the provision of training in Australia and a more effective training market and improved cross sectoral links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the government's training reform agenda a number of reports have been published about the role of education and training in this country. While we have seen a dramatic increase in secondary school retention rates as a result of recommendations contained in the Finn report of 1991, which established new targets for young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training, and there has been a consequent rise in further education aspirations amongst young Australians, the government has failed to provide the necessary expansion in education and training places. That has been a matter of some criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly over the last two years we have seen an unprecedented increase in the levels of unmet demand&mdash;that is the way it has been described&mdash;for further education. Certainly the Democrats have repeatedly warned against the simple expansion of this sector as a means of alleviating the effects of overcrowding and trying to diminish the dole queues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Carmichael report was introduced in July 1992 to respond to issues in the Finn report. It outlined a competency based approach to training in Australia. It envisaged a simple structure of vocational training that promoted and enabled progression from one level to another in all industries. In some ways the proposal to provide what was termed `articulation' is something which should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats see a strengthened role for industry in the provision and assistance with training in Australia. But we do not see this as an opportunity or an excuse for the government to reduce its role in education and training provisions. We believe that education and training has to be part of a well coordinated, strategic plan designed to cope with the needs of the changing work force. That is a consequence of technological restructuring that has been brought about by other changes in the workplace. Part of the charter of that whole system should be to give all Australians, regardless of their background, access to institutions of learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government still needs to comprehensively consider the complex issue of growth in education and training. It is with concern that I read of Minister Beazley's statements regarding growth in universities. That has been discussed in another forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats, along with groups such as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the Higher Education Round Table, believe that a higher level of growth is sustainable and we support moves for increased funds for the provision of those places. It is a sad and shameful fact that student funding in our universities has decreased below 1983 levels under 10 years of federal Labor rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look forward to the creation of a diverse and flexible education and training system which will lead us into the 21st century. We do see ANTA playing an integral role in identifying Australia's training needs for the present and well into the future. But integral to this is a cooperative and workable relationship between the states and the Commonwealth, and the Democrats encourage this cooperation. We have examined claims by this coalition that proposed section 14A threatens to breach that harmony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly do not support bullying tactics by the Commonwealth government. In fact, former Senator Sowada, in addressing the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill in 1992, expressed our concerns about some of the tactics then being used by the Commonwealth in the debate over whose funding and whose administrative responsibility the training sector was in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be specific, with regard to the concerns expressed by the coalition and various state education ministers about proposed section 14A of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill, we find that this proposed section gives the minister the ability to withhold funds intended for the states and territories if, in the minister's opinion, the state has failed to comply with the statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment was introduced belatedly by the government in the House of Representatives. Examination of the coalition's legal and financial concerns about this clause reveals that the consequences that it feared&mdash;namely, that all states and territories could be affected by the failure of one state or territory to comply with the statement&mdash;are not valid. According to the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations and Employment, the Hon. Kerry Chikarovski, the implications are both significant and would penalise the states unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the minister has the discretion to withdraw the Commonwealth funding in respect of one state or territory if that state or territory fails to comply with the statement as outlined in the schedule of the act, this relates specifically to Commonwealth sourced funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the creation of ANTA, we have seen a situation where the ministerial council, with all the ministers relating to the TAFE sector, can sit down with an agreement of a federal pool of money and work out the allocation of growth money to this sector. Unfortunately, what this bill does is put this whole cooperative arrangement under threat and does betray what a very carefully worked out agreement between the state and federal level originally provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill will amend the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 by inserting proposed new section 14A. It will allow the minister to direct ANTA not to allocate funding to a particular state or territory. The opposition has serious problems with this proposal as it undermines the original agreement and erodes the authority&mdash;and I think this is probably the most serious aspect&mdash;of the ministerial council, which was set up under the agreement as the ultimate authority governing ANTA. It was established after long negotiation and with specific purposes for the allocation of vocational money and training so that a national approach could be taken in line with what was advocated in the highly acclaimed Finn report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government and the state governments came into line on this report. ANTA was the result and now the agreement is under threat. The whole arrangement was to create an additional pool of money, which comes to $100 million in recurrent funding. For 1994 and 1995, 80 per cent of this cumulative growth fund, which equals $112 million and $168 million respectively, is to be allocated according to population share, with the balance allocated by the ministerial council. Unfortunately, because of this amendment, all these agreements on funding are now threatened. We believe that the possibility of any state or territory not complying with the ANTA agreement has been adequately dealt with in the original act. Thus it is clear that ANTA was established under the full cooperation of these various government bodies and, unfortunately, the goodwill is now being threatened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the heads of government meeting in 1992 it was agreed that if the states were found to be not in compliance with the ANTA agreement then it would be up to the ministerial council to take action. It was also agreed that any action by the ministerial council would apply only to that part of the ANTA fund pool which was represented by Commonwealth growth money. However, because of these amendments, the whole of the money allocated by the states is being put under threat. This, I believe, in a cooperative federal arrangement is intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has stated that the purpose of his amendments is to ensure compliance by the states. However, ANTA has already stated that it is quite happy with compliance by the states and territories under the current agreement. As we find in so many other areas of education, as we have discovered with ESOS and as we have discovered with higher education funding, the government is using a sledgehammer to crack a tiny problem. Again, it has overreacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, as amended, gives the minister far too wide powers of discretion. It does not indicate in any way in what respect the states or territories may be deemed to have not complied with the ANTA agreement. It is also of great concern that the minister may need only to have an opinion that there has been non-compliance before he or she issues a directive to disallow funding. This is an extraordinary power. It is completely unnecessary.</PARA>

The dangerous side effect of that sloppiness is that it gives the minister extraordinary powers of discretion, which is very dangerous.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that, in bringing about such revisions and amendments to the bill in the lower house, there was very little consultation undertaken with the various states or with ANTA before the government decided to go down this path. In all, this particular aspect of what is otherwise a reasonable piece of legislation is an enormous over-reaction. The coalition recognises the importance of vocational education and training. That is why we have supported ANTA and support most of the amendments in this bill. However, it is impossible to support amendments as draconian and as unnecessary as the 14A proposal, which holds a gun to the head of the states. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING LAWS AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing about the proposed new Part 1A of the abovenamed Bill which I understand is due to be considered by the Senate this week. I have major concerns about proposed section 14A of this legislation and would urge Coalition Senators to resist the passage of this section of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the 1992 Heads of Government Agreement, it was understood that ANTA would assess States' compliance with the Agreement (as set out in the Schedule to the ANTA Act 1992), especially the maintenance of effort requirement, and draw any defaulters to the attention of the Ministerial Council which would determine sanctions (thus, by implication, providing a forum for States in default to argue their case).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill allows the Commonwealth Minister to direct ANTA (Section 14A(2)) to withhold funds, in part or whole, without reference to the Ministerial Council, and conceivably on the basis of an assessment performed by his own department rather than the Authority (see 14A(3))". . . if, in the Minister's opinion, the State has failed to comply. . . ")</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, I understand that advice to the NSW Minister, Ms Chikarovski, suggests that Section 14A(2) may apply to all funds, including States' contributions, because they are placed in a central pool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister Beazley claims the legislation is directed at States which have been tardy in enacting complementary legislation. If this is the case it is a rather draconian approach which threatens the goodwill shown to date. For example, in WA I announced in September, after a review of my portfolio, changes to agency structures to provide for the required State Training Agency, and an intent to introduce legislation in the early part of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, I am concerned also that this legislation amends a COAG agreement without consultation and wonder whether this may be indicative of the Commonwealth's future attitude to agreements with the States and Territories.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter sent to me by facsimile on 29 November 1993 concerning the Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My letter of 12 October advised you that the amendment would enable the Minister to direct ANTA not to pay any, or only a specified amount, of the funds provided under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992</EMPHASIS> to a State/Territory if the Minister determines that it has not complied with the Heads of Government agreement. These funds are the Commonwealth's contribution to the ANTA funding pool for allocation among the States; that is, `base' and `growth' funds. The new provision would enable the Commonwealth Minister to withhold any proportion of the funds provided by the Commonwealth, potentially including base funds, as set out in my earlier letter. The amount of funds which might be withheld would be decided in the light of the seriousness of a State's breach of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Commonwealth Minister would not be able to withhold any State's contribution to ANTA. The amendment empowers the Minister to withhold `VET funding' only. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian National Training Authority Act 1992</EMPHASIS>, into which the new provision will be inserted, defines `VET funding' as `money paid to the Authority under Part 3 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992</EMPHASIS>'; that is, as Commonwealth-sourced funds only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I explained in my previous letter and emphasised at the October Ministerial Council meeting, the amendment is being introduced as a limited precautionary measure, available only until the end of 1995. The new power may be invoked only if a State breaches the July 1992 Heads of Government agreement. For this reason, I do not consider that the legislation is in any way contrary to the spirit of the agreement.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 30 November 1993 concerning the Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and the discussion of the Bill at the ANTA Ministerial Council in Hobart on 2 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You indicated at the ANTA Ministerial Council that you would be prepared to reconsider the Bill if there were unintended consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the consequences of the Bill are very significant and could lead to all States and Territories being affected if the Commonwealth Minister considers only one State or Territory breaches the ANTA agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is because, if the Commonwealth decided to withdraw the Commonwealth funding in respect of one State/Territory then the whole poool of ANTA funds would be reduced by that amount. Once the funds are pooled they lose their State tag and if the ANTA funds are distributed according to the principles determined by the ANTA Ministerial Council then all States would receive a reduced allocation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider this a serious unintended consequence and it is unfair for all States to be penalised for the actions of only one State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concern is even greater because of the wide discretion in the legislation for the Commonwealth Minister to determine if there has been a breach of the ANTA agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you indicated in Hobart, the intention of the legislation is to ensure all States and Territories pass the necessary legislation to provide the legislative base for the ANTA agreement. However, the Bill is wide reaching and of considerable concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore seek your urgent reconsideration of the Bill. In particular, I ask that you find an alternative means of achieving the objective of having States pass complementary legislation. A better approach would be one that provides an incentive rather than a penalty to all States and Territories. Also, the approach should be limited to the specific objective of passing legislation rather than allowing the discretion for any breach as in the current Bill. It would also be preferable for the approach to be based on some action of the ANTA Ministerial Council rather than solely on the action of the Commonwealth Minister.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 7 December 1993 to the Honourable Kim C. Beazley MP concerning the Vocational Education and Training Funding Laws Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am surprised you consider that the Bill represents the imposition of a penalty upon the States and that some form of encouragement to the States to meet their obligations under the ANTA agreement would be preferable. The ANTA agreement and Commonwealth legislation already provide a substantial encouragement, amounting to $720 million in growth funding and a considerably enhanced role for the States in the allocation of Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill would not have the unintended consequence that you have outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Mr Beazley explained in his letter of 1 December, it is quite clear that the new provision which would be inserted by the Bill in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian National Training Authority Act 1992</EMPHASIS> (ANTA Act) would enable the Commonwealth Minister to direct ANTA to withhold from a particular State Commonwealth-sourced funds only. The new provision refers to `VET funding', which is defined already in subsection 4(1) of the ANTA Act as `money paid to the Authority under Part 3 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992'.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although both Commonwealth- and State-sourced funds are in a sense `pooled' and become ANTA's money under the ANTA Act, the Act already requires (in section 14) reference back to the source of the funds when ANTA allocates the total pool. The new provision does not alter that arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By referring only to `VET funding' (ie, Commonwealth-sourced funds), the new provision would not enable the Minister to direct ANTA to withhold State-sourced funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provision would not affect adversely any State which was not the subject of a withholding direction' issued by the Minister to ANTA. Such a direction would have the effect of prohibiting ANTA from paying funds to a specified State in contravention of the direction but it would not reduce the allocation and payment of funds to other States, which remains under the control of the Ministerial Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible for the Minister to revoke a withholding direction at any time, including if a State's breach  of the ANTA agreement were remedied and, therefore, the funds could flow ultimately to that State. Alternatively, if the funds were to be withheld permanently, the Minister could exercise his existing power under subsection 9(1) of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992</EMPHASIS> to determine that the amount to be paid to ANTA from the total of the funds appropriated should be reduced by the withheld amount. If the Minister did not reduce the amount to be paid to ANTA, then the funds withheld from one or more States could be available to increase the allocation among the remaining States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I am satisfied that the bill would not result in the problems which you have outlined, it will proceed in its current form.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to note in broad, because of the pressure of time, that all of these letters from state ministers express their surprise, their dismay, at the action of the Commonwealth government in this amendment. They urge the Senate in this debate to remedy the situation. To be fair to those state ministers, some say that this clause should be completely removed; others that it be at least confined to the Commonwealth minister only having the power to block Commonwealth funds. There is also a leftover reference in one of the minister's letters to the fear, the anxiety, that the blocking of any money will have an effect upon the pool of all moneys to block the lot.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we agree that the late inclusion of the amendment in the lower house provided a flurry which really should not have occurred and provided reason to question what is going on, we believe that we have a proposition which would satisfactorily encompass the powers of the minister. To some extent, it rightly hinges on the question of how the minister shall form an opinion. There is always some conjecture as to how ministers of the crown form an opinion, but in this case we offer a little guidance that that opinion should be formed in consultation with the authority. For the reason that we have put some work in and found out just what the consequences will be, we will not be supporting the coalition's amendment but  foreshadow an amendment to have another effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not accept the amendment proposed by Senator Teague. First of all, it is to be made clear that this Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) is designed to put ANTA on a firm footing and to encourage the states to fulfil their obligations with regard to training. The provision in the legislation is a precautionary measure and I can tell Senator Teague that it applies only in respect of 1994 and 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to Senator Teague's concern in the face of assurances by the two relevant Commonwealth ministers, which he seemed to suggest he accepts. I am pleased to hear that because there was, for a minute, an implication that despite the assurances of the ministers Senator Teague did not take them at their word. He later made it clear that it was not so much the ministers' words that he doubted but the possibility of some kind of legal interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ministers have given that assurance. That is also spelt out in the explanatory memorandum. The minister has reiterated this in response to an opposition question in the other place. Senator Teague has already given us the benefit of the ministers' assurances in writing in correspondence with the New South Wales minister. There is no substance to the concern that Senator Teague has raised, particularly in the face of those assurances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell wonders how the minister might form an opinion. I am advised that this legislation is arranged this way so as to ensure that the states continue to make their contribution&mdash;to do their own bit&mdash;and to introduce complementary legislation. As I understand it, these arrangements were agreed by the states in July 1992 and only one state to this point has introduced complementary legislation. Certainly the failure to introduce complementary legislation would seem to me to be an indication that might assist the minister in forming an opinion. In the light of the assurances given by the minister on a number of occasions, there is absolutely no substance to the opposition's fears in this matter. The government will not be supporting this amendment. </PARA>

I also understand that funding for non-school organisations is being quarantined for the year 1994 pending further evaluation. So my second question is: would the minister please confirm this, or otherwise, and explain how this quarantining is being done and how the evaluation will occur during 1994 for the non-school organisations eventually to be included under this provision?</PARA></TALK.START>

We will oppose these clauses as we would seek to oppose any of these quite unjustified barriers being placed in the way of new non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an amendment to clause 15 that we will move in the committee stage. It addresses an excessive rigidity in the way in which this bill would require the counting of enrolled students attending a school on a daily basis. This rigidity seems to overlook absences from attendance at school simply on the grounds of sickness or attendance at a school excursion. We would not wish such a harsh provision to reduce funding for any school that has a genuine entitlement based upon what anyone would sensibly see as the genuine enrolment at that school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the funding for the national equity program. This bill seeks to broadband the categories that have existed for a number of years. I commend the Commonwealth, especially when we were in government 10 to 17 years ago&mdash;my first five years in the Senate were in a Liberal and National Party government. The initiatives that were taken under the Fraser government and the Hawke and Keating governments to initiate programs in the schools area have been a real asset to children in city and country areas. I see from this what is broadly understood by all of us to have been the eventual broadbanding of a number of these programs so that the states, with flexibility, can use the wider pool of moneys and judge more locally the way in which those moneys are apportioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this seems to impose new requirements for reporting by the states in such detail that it will be extraordinarily burdensome, and I do not think fully justified. This will lead to difficulties in accountability for the use of Commonwealth money. My third question is: what is the status of negotiations with the states with regard to the numerous agreements required by this bill between the Commonwealth and the states?  Are they concluded? Are there difficulties?  Has there been any area of difficulty or disagreement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fourth question is: is it correct that the Commonwealth is seeking to make the states so accountable to the Commonwealth that they actually have to account for their own money, their own programs&mdash;that the states' own funding will need to be reported to the Commonwealth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One part of this refinement of national equity programs will be to lead an opposition amendment, and that concerns the very successful country areas program&mdash;I would like it to have been even more successful with more resources. It is of enormous concern to rural communities out in the bush, where the country areas program is of enormous value to Australia's children living in isolated towns and families throughout the countryside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is of the view that the merger proposed in this legislation of the disadvantaged schools program and the country areas program into one pool may put in jeopardy the quantum of moneys that is to be spent on the country areas program. A quarter of the money is currently spent on the country areas program and three-quarters on the disadvantaged schools program. Accordingly, we will move amendments at the committee stage to preserve the country areas program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because my colleagues wish this debate to proceed as quickly as possible, I do not have time to instance rural communities all over Australia, in all states, that have a total commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution of resources for the country areas program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill. This, in the usual way, provides funding for 1996 and extra funding for preceding years in this rolling triennium. This bill does have the opposition's support, but particular aspects deserve comment and criticism. The main area is the new provisions with regard to the higher education contribution scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government in the budget sought to introduce for the first time a rate of payment by students in our universities at 1 1/2 times the normal rate if they did not make progress through their course at a speed that suited the Labor Party in government. Of course, this led to many of us expressing dismay at how this would operate and to the deleterious effects this would have on many students. I recognise and support the government's withdrawal of this proposal which occurred as a result of the pressure that has been put on it since the budget. An amendment was introduced in the House of Representatives with the effect that students who, according to Ministers Beazley and Free, go too slowly through their courses no longer face the prospect of paying HECS at 1 1/2 times the normal rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one matter that does remain in the bill before us is the imposition of double HECS&mdash;that is, twice the rate of the higher education contribution scheme. The Labor government's proposal is that this apply to those undertaking second degrees. First of all, the opposition is quite appalled that this is being applied retrospectively. It will not apply only to those enrolling for a second degree for the first time from January 1994. It is imposed retrospectively on many students who are already involved in second degree courses. There has not been a proper assessment of the impact this will have upon women, upon disabled students or upon students who have gained their first degrees overseas, some of them refugees, whose qualifications are not accepted in Australia. Also, some amalgamations of universities will lead to its being very hard to define whether someone has a first degree or not and there will be all sorts of inequity because some will fall on this side of the line and some on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the very important matter that for years, indeed decades, there have been some approved combined degrees, for instance for Austudy purposes. These approved combined degrees include, for example, law/economics and medicine/science and a wide range of combined degrees. In all these months the opposition was not assured by the Labor government or by any clear statement of Labor ministers that even these worthy combined degrees were sacrosanct from this double HECS. Accordingly, the opposition moved in the Senate that this matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. In due course my colleague Senator Tierney will refer to the Senate committee's consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the Senate committee's findings, which were basically that this proposal had inequities that were contradictory to the government's intentions for this measure, and as a result of all the matters I have already referred to, the opposition has resolved to oppose the whole measure completely. We will move an amendment in the committee stage that will completely abolish the double rate of higher education contribution scheme with regard to any student in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major reason that the opposition has arrived at this position, quite apart from the half a dozen matters that I have already referred to, is that we in Australia need to make sure that we have graduates who are not just specialists but who have a combination of skills at a high level which in each profession will serve this country very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also in this bill&mdash;I am sure the Democrats will refer to it more than I am able to&mdash;increases in the repayment levels for contributions to repay the higher education contribution scheme debt when a graduate is employed and earning an income. The opposition has given very careful consideration to this matter and has consulted many of those affected, but we recognise that there is an elected government and that this is integrally connected with the budget as a whole. Therefore, consistent with our position over many years, although we would not have proposed this ourselves and our policy will come forth nearer to the coming election, we will allow the government's proposals on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that the students of Australia have been cheated and deceived by a Labor government that did not disclose this measure before the last election. Those opposite were the ones who said, `Beware a Liberal government', even though we were promising in the election $3 billion more of resources for education. The Labor government stayed silent about this matter and has laid more penalty upon the students of Australia. We will remind the students of Australia of the cheating and deception, indeed the lies, of the Labor government with regard to support for students. The responsibility for this measure lies with the Labor government, and the students of Australia must understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only a few minutes to refer to open learning. This bill extends HECS to open learning and we support that measure. We see that it is not fully extended to those whom I would call `part time' in open learning. I expect an amendment will be moved by another senator to extend it more fully from the opposition's point of view, but we will ask the government to keep this matter under review. If there is a change on the grounds of equity, on the grounds of the outcome being to the benefit of Australia, then we would wish the government to put arguments for an extension of open learning-HECS availability even to part-time students. It is not a matter of policy for us. We are just saying that we wish to monitor it. I have a fifth question: what is the government's intention with regard to the part-time enrolments in open learning with regard to access to HECS?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the government's measures in this legislation with regard to research funding. We are not convinced about what the government is doing here&mdash;neither are universities; neither is the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. There is a great deal of dismay about what the Labor Party is doing with regard to research funding. Again, we will observe this matter as an opposition and be fully open to hear the views of our universities on this matter, postgraduate degrees and course work as undertaken by postgraduate students. We think the present proposals are unfortunate but, by virtue of the fact that this is an elected government which has a budget to maintain, we will allow the government's measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, will the minister explain why in the short term the number of postgraduate awards will decrease from 23,730 to 20,700 before in the middle term it rises again?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Tierney. The Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill amends what is called the HEFA act to provide $4.6 million-plus for higher education funding and introduces budget measures that include HECS hikes, increased HECS repayment rates, further deregulation of the postgraduate sector and a deferred payment system for the open learning initiative. As foreshadowed before the budget, during the budget and after the budget, the Australian Democrats will be opposing the changes that entrench the user pays principles for higher education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow amendments that are designed to soften the budget blow. The 1993-94 budget will be remembered as a punitive and brain-draining budget. It introduced some of the harshest measures for students in the area of fees and charges, as well as penalties for slow progress. It hit hard at students, imposing crippling debt levels and education penalties, and it symbolises further entrenchment of the user pays principles in higher education. That is a trend that is becoming a feature of our secondary school system as well. I think that ought to be recognised. It is being recognised by the media, but it has been insufficiently recognised in this place. I intend to do something about that the next time this parliament sits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most disturbing aspect of these changes is the decision to impose double HECS for second degrees. It is amusing to me that the acronym HECS is reminiscent of a medieval witch's curse&mdash;and there is nothing worse than a double curse. The rationale behind this move is apparently to free up undergraduate places for school leavers and other first timers in the system. I suggest that that is an excuse rather than a rationale. It does not bear scrutiny. It is blatantly a money-grabbing exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the announcement on budget night, the Democrats have been opposed to double HECS for second degrees. It was with great relief that we welcomed the final announcement during this week that the coalition will adopt a similar position. We had heard hints of that. We were rather incredulous at first, but we now congratulate members of the coalition for staying firm and for convincing their shadow cabinet that such a move was justified. That is not a hollow congratulation. I know that, in particular, senators with a particular interest in and knowledge of education have persisted to convince their shadow cabinet. The double HECS should never have been accepted because it is a double whammy for students seeking to upgrade their skills and their knowledge and for those, such as teachers, who have to continually upgrade their professional skills to keep pace with an ever-changing career environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Senate standing committee hearing on this issue, the Department of Education, Employment and Training officials admitted that this measure was a deterrent&mdash;for goodness sake, fancy calling it that; fancy admitting that&mdash;for students who had already accessed the system to deter them from further participating in it. This smacks of the attitude that somehow these people are privileged. This is despite a purported commitment to access and equity. People are only allowed to access it once, regardless of talent, regardless of merit and regardless of benefit to the wider community. This is a cherry to be tasted just once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal is not only a psychological but also a blatant financial disincentive to study that will discriminate against the disabled, against women, against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and against other traditionally disadvantaged groups. It will also disadvantage people who have come from overseas to add to Australia's pool of talent and ability. The Democrats will be opposing clauses 12 and 13, which refer to double HECS for second degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other punitive budget proposal which has since been defeated&mdash;as a result of combined criticism from the Democrats, students and, eventually, opposition, as well as round criticism&mdash;was the introduction of the minimum time rule, in which students were required to complete their degree in a certain time or else incur a 50 per cent increased penalty in their HECS debt for each additional unit they studied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling produced figures which demonstrated that women are already five times less likely than men to repay their HECS debt by the age of 30, yet the government introduced a set of measures which discriminates against women, particularly mature age women returning to study, who often experience interrupted periods of study as a result of employment commitments which may be particular to their age group and their other commitments, whether they be family or others. The research highlighted the debt burden that many women face well into their forties and fifties&mdash;a lifetime of debt for a group that suffered in education until the removal of tertiary fees in the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the other place Mr Snowdon claimed in his speech in the second reading debate that the budget measures will reduce Commonwealth government outlays to higher education and, hence, the public sector financial burden. It is extraordinary that the provision of public education at all levels&mdash;primary, secondary and tertiary&mdash;should be considered a burden as opposed to an inalienable right for all Australians. If it is reflective of the government attitude that a member of the House of Representatives, speaking on behalf of the government, can characterise it as a burden, I think it should be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats are proud to be a political party which is committed to a publicly funded and fair education system for all. Our voting record supports this. Even when the Labor Party chose to sell out students, and education in general, in the 1980s, we retained our opposition to this concept of user pays education, which we believe eventually leads to a system of the privileged having access to education and the meritorious suffering a denial of access. This from a government that touts access and equity at every opportunity!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The duplicity is revealed when we examine further the doublespeak. According to Mr Snowdon:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The HECS measures in this bill are essential for the government to meet its ongoing commitment to increased access.</PARA>
<PARA>How is the government increasing access? Is it doing so by increasing the tax burden on the student body, by condemning the country's future generations to debt so that they begin their non-student life with a massive debt hanging other their careers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of our support for education as a life-long process, the Democrats believe that the advent of new learning techniques such as open learning provide opportunities for those groups previously denied access to further education, such as the geographically isolated, the disabled, the socially isolated, the economically disabled&mdash;at least the economically disadvantaged. Since the introduction of open learning, the Democrats have argued for a deferred payment for open learning students. While this bill introduces a HECS-style payment mechanism for those open learning students who are studying at a 75 per cent full-time load minimum, we seek to amend that load to decrease the full-time load minimum. There are valid educational reasons for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accepted, longstanding validity of the approach that has been adopted by well established institutes that provide distance education has been that an over-commitment in the early phases is not recommended; that an introduction at a level which is able to determine the students' commitment and ability is by far the most economical way to approach it. That sort of approach does not force dropouts from overload. It does not force people to engage in two or three course units and then eventually find they are unable to meet the learning requirements, at great expense to the institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a number of students committing themselves to several units of study, there is the consequent administrative and infrastructural commitment that is required from the institution. It is no different from open learning. I would have thought that the conventional wisdom that has been well established in distance education could have been followed in this regard. It is amazing that the open learning pattern has been established with a 75 per cent load minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not support the proposed increases in the rate of HECS repayment from two or three or four per cent to three, four and five per cent respectively and the parallel lowering of the threshold at which students begin to repay their HECS debt from $27,748 down to $26,402. This is occurring at a time when graduate starting salaries are at a 16-year low and we have incredible unemployment figures for graduates. The government has chosen to implement these measures which have little support from academic or student groups. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee opposes these sorts of measures from the educational perspective. They are punitive; there is no validity from an educational perspective in following these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other opposition is well documented. An increasing and comprehensive number of submissions have been sent to the Senate standing committee and to my colleagues. We have had all the available techniques of expressing opposition taken advantage of. As well as that, almost every sitting day since the budget I have tabled in this place a petition opposing the HECS increases; the cumulative total is well over 5,000 signatures from people who oppose these HECS changes. These petitions should have woken the government out of its user pays thoughts. They should have reminded the government that education is a right; it is not a privilege, and that these reforms are unfair and regressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever it was that provoked and consolidated the coalition's position on this issue, it is pleasing to see that it has occurred. I do not know whether it was the petitions or the contact from the vested interests in this area; whatever it was, I am pleased to see that it has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem associated with this was revealed at the Senate standing committee hearing into this bill. It concerned the further deregulation of the postgraduate sector in this year's budget. Postgraduate course fees are already as high as $33,000 at some institutions. Inadequate research funding, which was revealed at yet another hearing by the same standing committee, exposes the fraud of the government's commitment to research for a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out this week in this place by way of a notice of motion, there is no assurance of quality control for postgraduate fee-paying courses, nor is there any pattern in fee paying arrangements. The Australian Democrats support calls by the Council of Postgraduate Associations of Australia which calls for stronger guidelines to accompany this further deregulation. The other end of the spectrum of this bill reveals a questioning that we should apply to the government's commitment to the provision of quality education at a secondary and primary level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993. There is a contentious issue in relation to this bill which deserves much greater consideration than is allowed by the time we have for debate. The issue of broad banding the country areas in the disadvantaged schools program has been an area of interest during the lead-up to this debate. It is not hard to see why there has been confusion. The country areas program and the disadvantaged schools project play a fundamental role in ensuring that schoolchildren are not educationally disadvantaged by their geographical isolation, by their low socioeconomic status or by any other disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We strongly support these programs but accept that there is room for improvement in certain areas. That was the subject of much of our questioning at the committee's hearing into these programs. We are committed to the continuation and the strengthening of the country areas program for schools. The Democrats supported the dissenting report which was written by the committee of inquiry. Having supported that, we followed the arguments that we had put at that stage to ensure that the problems that had been identified were explained and rectified. At that stage, as far as I could see, the coalition accepted that its role had finished. After the signing of the dissenting report, the minority report, we saw no movement from those others who had identified problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I investigated the claims which were made by the department and by the parents who were involved. The community was rightly concerned. As a result of that persistence, I have been assured that participation and consultation in this program will not be lessened. I thank the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Boswell, for a copy of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training report on the country areas program. Those who were interested in this area, myself included, were already aware of that report. That report was commissioned quite a few years ago. In fact, this very report provided the stimulus for the changes that we see before us today. I am sure that Senator Boswell is aware of that fact, given that he went to so much trouble providing me with a copy of the report. I would have thought it would be quite evident that that report was the initiator of these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly glad to see that a growing number of agreements are being signed between state governments and the Commonwealth government. I will examine one at random, namely, the agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Northern Territory government. On examination, it reveals at schedule 2, page 20, that country areas program schools will be identified; that there is a provision for allocation to country area schools; that this is defined well and truly within this agreement; and that there is an index for identifying disadvantaged schools programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a comprehensive document. These agreements cover the Northern Territory Government, the Queensland Catholic Education Commission, other state government bodies and education providers. Anyone who reads them will, I think, see that fears of any threat to the country areas program have been resolved and that these commitments have been signed. I am assured that the matters that were of concern to us at the time of the committee inquiry have now been addressed. For that reason we support that aspect of that bill. We have many other concerns which we will address during the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately the State Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993 and the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. As Senator Bell indicated, one wonders why we are debating these bills cognately as they have absolutely nothing to do with each other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start with the bill that Senator Bell finished with, which is the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993. The main purpose of that bill is to implement a national equity program for schools. When this idea was first floated, I was initially quite attracted to it. I thought that rolling funding into a broadbanding approach would provide flexibility in the system. I was also attracted to it because it seemed to provide the states with far more flexibility in the way in which they were using their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not long before it was drawn to my attention personally, and also through the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, that there were considerable problems with this approach. The Senate will hear from me, as it has heard from others, of problems on the CAP side&mdash;the country areas program. There are also programs coming from the other side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authorities of an excellent school by the name of Hopetown in Wyong, near my home town, which I visited with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), expressed considerable concern that this arrangement would be so flexible that the school would lose its funding. Even though there is a temporary stay on this in that it is not being applied for a year, I am aware that considerable concern is being expressed by people connected with the disadvantaged schools. I want to focus mainly on the concerns of people in the country areas program. Although CAP is a very successful program, it appears that the government is yet again interfering with a very successful arrangement. There is a great saying in politics that if it is not broken, do not fix it. But here we see the government meddling, yet again, in an extremely successful program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, a review of CAP recommended that, in view of the widespread success which CAP has had to date in promoting positive attitudes towards schooling and in light of the new demand being placed on rural schools, funding should be increased for this program. The great danger of broadbanding, particularly if the government wants to find some extra money for its disadvantaged schools, is that it will drain it away from CAP. That is not to say there should not be extra money for disadvantaged schools, certainly there should be, but it should not be at the expense of this CAP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A unique feature of CAP which the government is endangering is the cooperative arrangements that exist in many areas between parents, teachers and the community. They have brought about some excellent innovative approaches when they have applied for CAP funding for special projects. Cooperative arrangements have been put in place in different country areas between different types of schools. In many areas intersystemic, Catholic, independent and government schools are working together in isolated areas on particular programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The programs that have been developed in these isolated areas have provided these children with a very wide range of educational, social, cultural and recreational experiences that are not available locally. These are now under threat because of the uncertainty created by this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This aspect is perhaps best summed up by Mr Swales from the Isolated Children/Parents Association. In praising what CAP is doing, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This covers the whole area of sporting contact and social contact, as well as simply seeing what a musical instrument looks like, let alone the ability to see an orchestra.</PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who live in urban areas take the facilities that are available in urban areas completely for granted. Those of us who live in cities take for granted the fact that we can go to opera houses and attend concerts. It is a bit hard for us to realise that in these isolated areas they do not even get to see musical instruments unless special provision is made for this in programs like CAP. For that reason, it should not be put under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals in this legislation are putting it under threat. This concern was raised by many of the witnesses before the Senate standing committee. DEET representatives also appeared before us at that committee. Their arguments for trying to change these arrangements were not very convincing. They said that DEET would reduce administrative costs, that a rolling triennium will allow better planning and that the pooling of funds will allow greater flexibility. But when we listened to the community, we found that such claims were refuted. I will quote one comment made to the committee by the president of the Country Areas Association to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have seen or been told of absolutely no evidence that linking CAP and DSP was a suggestion of any CAP community member.</PARA>
<PARA>These sorts of innovations have certainly not come from the people in the community. It is just another scheme that has been dreamed up by DEET. It looks superficially attractive but has great disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the work of Senator Crane, who joined me on this committee, as well as Senator Bell, in writing the dissenting report. We saw the dangers that this change would make to CAP and, therefore, to isolated children. In our dissenting report, we found that the funding of CAP was vulnerable to erosion and that DSP and CAP are very disparate in their aims and therefore should not be linked in this way. The students affected by CAP and DSP are also quite disparate, with only a nine per cent overlap between the two groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also found that if such a bill were introduced, it would make one of the great innovations of CAP&mdash;the clustering of schools in a cooperative arrangement&mdash;very difficult. Dr Lloyd of the Country Areas Association said in his submission to the committee that the result of such a change in legislation would be a total undermining of the cluster system, which is fundamental to CAP right across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program which is suggested by the government in this legislation will break funding into government and non-government streams. It will particularly disadvantage the smaller schools. There is already evidence of proposals that money originally intended for CAP is to be drifted away to the DSP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel, and this was the conclusion of our dissenting report on this matter, that the status quo needs to be maintained for the country areas program. It is an extremely successful program. It is not broken so it should not be fixed. People whose funding is now in danger should have that funding secured for such a worthwhile approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill being debated cognately is the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill.

Members of the government went about the country bashing the opposition over the head for what we were proposing to do with various things. It did not mention that it was going to increase anything. I cannot recall the government saying that it would put anything up for students. Throughout the Labor election campaign we found deception and lies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By looking at the number of government senators in the chamber, we can tell that they are impressed with this measure! Senator Burns is the only government senator present. Where are the Labor speakers on this bill? There is no-one here supporting the minister. The minister should look at the speakers' list. The opposition has had all the speakers on this bill and the government has not even had one. Government senators would not be game to speak on this bill and then go out into the student community. The government has been very deceiving and has misled the students. Let me assure the government that, as we approach the next election, the opposition will be reminding the students of the duplicity of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will return to some of the specific criticisms of the bill in the limited time that I have left. One of the most frequent criticisms of this proposal is that students who are often very poorly off financially and who decide to undertake a second degree to improve their qualifications now find themselves facing a double HECS arrangement. When they started they were only aware that they had to pay single HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ken Fowlie was a great supporter of the Labor Party before the election. I wonder if he is now. I used to debate this matter with him on radio around the country. He is a great advocate for the government but he is not too impressed with what the government has done in relation to this matter. He said in evidence to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Anecdotally, as we understand it at this stage, there are some people who will seriously consider not completing their qualifications as they do not believe they are financially in a position to be able to meet the new requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>To a government that touts itself as the government of social justice, access and equity, we must point out what it is doing to some of the most disadvantaged people in this community. For the sake of $10 million a year the government is taking money away from some of the most disadvantaged people in this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not even Senator Zakharov, the Chairman of the committee, has come down to defend the government on this one. She was here earlier but she has now left. I was going to invite her to speak on this matter and get her to defend double HECS. As a matter of fact, Senator Zakharov let slip during the hearings that she was opposed to HECS. That is on the record. I said to Senator Zakharov, `If you are opposed to HECS, you must obviously be opposed to double HECS.' I do not think she has changed her mind on this matter. She should come in here and defend HECS. We would be interested in listening to her contribution on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the Labor Party has done to other people with regard to social justice, access and equity. Let us take the people who have come from overseas. They have obtained their initial qualifications at no expense to the Australian taxpayer. They come in and they find that they have to pay double HECS. They would pay double HECS if they admitted they had a degree from overseas. How would we know? People could have a degree from the University of the Ukraine, but unless they tell us that we would not know. The people who are more deceptive and sneaky will avoid double HECS and the honest ones will pay it. I do not think the government is setting up a particularly good principle there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former Prime Minister said that we were trying to become the clever country. Yet this whole measure works against the notion of lifelong learning, where people return to upgrade their skill.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These people are repaying the debt, often concurrently while they are trying to retrain and get their professional qualifications, perhaps holding down a job that is not particularly well paid and trying to maintain a family. We are penalising them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is great access and great equity! It was further argued that many who undertook a second degree did not anticipate receiving significant additional income through their employment as a result of that second degree and yet the government whacked them with double HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an impediment particularly to women who seek to re-enter the work force and retrain, having being absent for perhaps 10 or 20 years. They may want to retrain in a particular profession and the government whacks them with double HECS. We are talking about $4,500 a year and these are often some of the most disadvantaged students. How can they afford to pay that, particularly when it has been put on so suddenly? Professor Hall, of the National Tertiary Education Union, explained it thus and he gave a specific example that summed up very well what I have been saying. At the committee, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the classic example would be a woman who does a Bachelor of Arts degree at age 20-21. She then has a family, comes back into the work force 10 years later and finds that her original qualification is not going to get her a job or that she has now become interested in a professional occupation, such as social work, etc. This legislation will impose a penalty on her to train in a professional area that would be more suitable for her particular skills and talents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably one of the most tragic things about this legislation is the way in which it will disadvantage another group. I am talking about people who have suffered some sort of disability. They cannot go and work in the area of their original qualification because of their disability and they have to undertake some other training to work in another area. Double HECS hits these people very hard. It singles out these disadvantaged students. This is an unfair bill; it is an inequitable bill. Yet again we have another piece of legislation from this government for which it has absolutely no mandate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993. I will confine my comments on this bill to its effect on the priority country area programs, known in Queensland as PCAP. The National and Liberal parties will be supporting an amendment to this bill which disallows the transfer of funding in the equity component of the national equity program between the country areas program and the disadvantaged schools program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The status quo will be maintained without any financial impact. The National and Liberal parties believe that the education needs of country children cannot be met through pooling funds of two quite separate areas of need. It would not be fair to either isolated children or socioeconomically disadvantaged children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it now stands, PCAP is providing a much needed and appreciated program for 150,000 country students. Rural families are very concerned that any changes to the PCAP format will deny their children educational opportunities taken for granted in city areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training received many submissions from rural communities and country schools urging that PCAP be retained in its present form. The committee's majority report recommended only that it would monitor the operation of the country areas element. This is a bit like yesterday's child-care accreditation debate, where costs will be reviewed so many months down the track. Of course, the horse will have bolted by then. The CAP was reviewed in 1990 by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, which affirmed the value of CAP and recommended an increase in funding of $3.5 million to $15 million, which was implemented. So why change now? Why the backflip?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many parents are very worried about what will happen in Queensland should this bill go through unamended. The problem is that in Queensland we have a state government intent on purging services from rural areas. Once it got its hands on the PCAP money, it would not be long before some of those funds were syphoned off into the highly populated urban areas to shore up its election support. That is very similar to the Ros Kelly story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Assurances that the CAP would continue in its present form are only valid for the day they are made. The only legislative safeguard in this bill is that the Commonwealth minister may intervene if a program is compromised. This is little more than window dressing because, once the PCAP infrastructure is dismantled, the government would be most unlikely to recreate it to manage PCAP funding. Hence, there are no effective safeguards that would ensure that the PCAP program would continue in either its present form or with its present level of funding. It would be up to the Premier, and his record on rural services is not pretty. </PARA>

If the Goss government were to administer a combined PCAP and disadvantage schools program, it would not be very long before rural children suffered some more.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">PCAP attempts to close the gap between rural and metropolitan schools in terms of social, artistic and educational development.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PCAP has definitely enabled our children to access things they would never have otherwise experienced. There was a swimming camp in Julia Ck for Normanton children. None of our kids would have a chance without PCAP. Our generation had nothing like this and found it very difficult to go away from the bush, to go to boarding school, to make their way.

So the government that really counts in Australia&mdash;this government, the national government&mdash;is still in the hands of the Australian Labor Party until the next election, and we are only as good as our next election. I conclude my second reading remarks so that we can knock off.</PARA></TALK.START>
