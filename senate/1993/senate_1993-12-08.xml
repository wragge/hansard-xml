<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of the cost of implementing the guidelines for the accreditation of child care centres.</PARA>
<PARA>The decision by the coalition to move to disallow these accreditation guidelines is not one that has been taken lightly. But the flaws in these guidelines, in particular the decision to link accreditation to eligibility for child-care assistance, have moved the coalition to take the stand reflected in the motion before us today. The other motion before us today is for the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs to be given a reference to examine the costs of implementing the guidelines for the accreditation of child-care centres. This relates closely to the disallowance motion and, hence, my motion to have a cognate debate on these notices of motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only certainty about the cost impact of accreditation is that it will be significantly greater than the figure being suggested by the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley. I will return to that point later in my speech. In taking the stand to disallow the accreditation guidelines, no-one should lose sight of the fact that the coalition is strongly committed to quality child care. The opening sentence in the introduction to our 1993 child-care policy statement, released during the last election, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Affordable quality child care is a basic right of all parents. </PARA>
<PARA>Later in our policy, we state that we will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . encourage parents and the staff of centres to work together to ensure that the available services are of high quality and reflect a continuing commitment to the needs and aspirations of both parents and children.</PARA>
<PARA>So there can be no doubting the commitment of the coalition to quality child care. The coalition is also committed to a voluntary system of accreditation, but not to this version of compulsory accreditation put forward by the government. Let there be no misunderstanding. Despite what Senator Crowley claims, the government's version of accreditation is completely compulsory. It is compulsory because the guidelines say that the fee relief will be payable only to parents whose children attend an accredited centre. What message does that send? Obviously, the government is effectively holding a gun to the heads of child-care centres and, indeed, a gun to the heads of parents relying on that relief. If the guidelines are not followed then, as a consequence, no fee relief is obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the most outrageous aspect of the guidelines before us today is that they do not reflect what the majority of child-care centres want and nor do they reflect what the parents want. The guidelines before us today are not the product of a ground swell of parental concern about the quality of child care provided to their children; rather, the guidelines are the product of a deal which occurred at the time of the 1990 election campaign. I invite anybody to take the trouble to read the guidelines because only then will that person understand the parental concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, especially the minister. Mr Hawke, in his 1990 election speech, announced that fee relief would be extended to the private sector. However, this extension was bitterly opposed by the ACTU and many child-care activists. It is clear that the price for allowing this to go ahead was a commitment from the government to establish a national accreditation system for all long day child-care centres. In June 1990, the relevant minister, Mr Staples, established a national advisory committee of child-care industry representatives. As is typical of all the subsequent committees established to develop accreditation, this committee was heavily biased against the private sector. It was chaired by Mary Crawford, the honourable member for Forde. The committee reported to Mr Staples in August 1990 and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;included a recommendation advocating the attachment of quality assurance conditions to receipt of child-care fee relief.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1991 the government established the Interim National Accreditation Council, headed by Ms Jane Singleton. Again, the composition of the committee was totally unbalanced. The 16-member committee included just two representatives from the private sector and two parent representatives. The Interim National Accreditation Council presented an interim report to Mr Staples in June 1992 and a final report in November 1992. Just before the interim report of the council, the caucus subcommittee on child care reported to the government on its 1992 child-care consultations. The findings are very illuminating and are absolutely relevant to today's debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee states in its May 1992 report that the sole purpose of its consultations was to listen to the views of parents, child-care workers and the community and to report those views back to the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I tell Senator Zakharov that it found nothing like that at all. Let me quote some of the important views canvassed by the committee. Under a section headed `Key themes', the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a widespread feeling that the child-care system Australia has now is worth protecting, that we got it about right.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Speaker after speaker at public meetings pointed to the fact that Australia currently has one of the best child-care systems in the world. Australia's provision of quality child care is well in advance of many European countries and well in front of both the United States and Britain. In fact, Australia's approach is held up by child-care advocates in those countries as a model.</PARA>
<PARA>These were the views that were coming back to the government through its caucus subcommittee on child care. There was no widespread call for a system of compulsory accreditation, but the government ploughed on regardless. At the last election the government confirmed that, if re-elected, it would pursue a national system of accreditation. But what about the link to fee relief? There is no mention of it by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS> statement. He simply states, `We have decided to introduce a system of national accreditation of child-care centres'. There is not a word about it being compulsory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the ALP child-care policy statement say about it? It talks about establishment and operation of the National Child Care Accreditation Council, assessment of centres, development of the handbook and so on. The description of the accreditation system goes on for six paragraphs, but not once is it explicitly stated that accreditation will be linked to fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that this link was so clearly on the agenda coming up to the election, it is worth asking why it was not mentioned in the policy statement. The reason is that cabinet rejected it. There was no cabinet authority for including such a commitment in the policy statement. In fact, according to former Senator Peter Walsh, the attempt to link accreditation to eligibility for fee relief was rejected by cabinet on at least two occasions. We now know that it was not until April of this year, according to the minister, that the cabinet approved making this link. It took three attempts from the bureaucracy, which refused to take no for an answer, before the link actually got up through cabinet. I know that there are a great many people on the other side who are as disappointed with this decision as we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the election we have seen yet another committee established to oversee accreditation, and this is the National Child Care Accreditation Council. Once again, we find that that council is not truly representative of the child-care sector. There are presently no parent representatives on the council. The final version of the accreditation guidelines which we are debating today has passed through the council without a single representative parent being able to express a view other than those who happen to be parents who are on the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the council was appointed in July of this year, the two representatives of the private child-care sector have resigned. They resigned because they could no longer tolerate their membership of the council being used by the Minister for Family Services as evidence that the private sector was consulted and supported accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector, almost without exception, is opposed to the government's accreditation system and, in particular, the link between accreditation and fee relief. The importance of this resistance cannot be overstated because the private sector has the majority of long day child-care places in this country. According to figures based on preliminary 1992 child-care census data, supplied to Senator Newman by the department, around 104,000 long day care places are available in Australia. Of these, 53,920 are provided by private operators. Around 7,450 are provided by employer and non-profit centres. Community based centres provide around 42,800 places. This means that the private sector provides about 52,000 of all child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one notes that a significant portion of the non-profit sector is also opposed to the compulsory system being put forward by the government, it becomes clear that the majority of the child-care sector industry opposes these guidelines. That is not the only reason for opposition. I have before me a letter from the Creche and Kindergarten Association of Queensland that has another concern. It is concerned about the possible massive expansion of private commercial child-care centres in Queensland and has expressed concern to the minister about the lack of planning and control exercised by the government and the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services. I know that the minister will get up again and mislead the Senate by suggesting that the private sector is not unified in its approach on this issue. </PARA>

The minister has claimed that the private sector in Canberra and Queensland supported these guidelines, including the link to fee relief. This is absolutely wrong. I understand that the minister has received a letter from the President of the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations on behalf of, amongst others, the Queensland and ACT associations refuting the minister's claim. But as the minister finds herself in increasing trouble on these guidelines, as she buckles under the pressure from within her own party, the pressure from parents and child-care centre owners and the pressure from the media, we find that she is having less and less regard for the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in question time on 24 November and again during question time yesterday, in a very disingenuous way, tried to suggest that Senator Newman supported the government's accreditation guidelines. That is an outrageous and totally false claim. On both occasions, I am delighted to say, Senator Newman was constrained to come to the telephone and contact us immediately to refute those claims. On 24 November, she put out a press release refuting those claims. Yet the minister had the absolute gall to repeat those statements subsequently. To my way of thinking, that supports the previous statement that I made and the import of it should be apparent to all. She accused Senator McGauran of using the privileges of parliament and yet did the same herself on two subsequent occasions knowing full well that Senator Newman had refuted the claim that she put forward. It is outrageous and totally false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread community concern from parents, from child-care centre operators and, as I saw on television last night, from the Catholic church. There is widespread concern, no matter what the minister says. Only a few weeks ago bus loads of parents came to Parliament House to protest about the linkage. Senator Crowley and her arguments on accreditation were utterly demolished on Sydney radio by John Laws. I would recommend to anybody who wants a bit of light entertainment to read the transcript of that radio interview. I understand now why Mr Laws has a reputation for demolition because, if ever anybody got demolished, it was Senator Crowley. It took her virtually the length of the interview to even concede that, if a satisfactory standard is not achieved on all 52 principles, a centre will not be accredited and parents sending their children to the centre will not be eligible for fee relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the interview, she showed that she was not wholly familiar with the guidelines. More importantly, she showed that she has no faith in the ability of parents to determine whether their children are receiving adequate care. I notice that that was mentioned again today. Incredibly, the government seems to hold the belief that it knows better than parents. Under the present system, a parent can take a child out of a child-care centre&mdash;</PARA>

There will be more jobs for bureaucrats out of all this&mdash;I suppose that will be a spin-off&mdash;but it will do nothing for parents.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said previously, we support a scheme of voluntary accreditation in order to establish a benchmark against which to measure quality. But we will not support a scheme which is made compulsory by linking accreditation to fee relief. As we point out in our policy, parents are entitled to assume that all formal child-care services will meet certain specified standards which will guarantee adequate health and safety provisions, child/staff and space ratios, and staff qualifications. However, there can be no doubt that parents are the best judges of the quality of available services. Parents are the best judges of whether services are appropriate and adequate for their children. It should be parents who choose the quality of care suitable for their children&mdash;not some government-appointed agency which seeks to usurp the role of the parent through the state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument is sometimes put that the lack of available child-care places means that parents have very little choice in where they send their children. In some instances this may be so, but the availability of child-care places and the imposition of a compulsory accreditation system are two quite different matters. One cannot be used to justify the other. If there are not enough child-care places, the solution is not the introduction of a bureaucratic national scheme of accreditation but the provision of more child-care places. As I have mentioned previously, that is a concern of the Queensland Creche and Kindergarten Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer is not to engage in an elaborate system of social engineering. I could quote no better person than former Labor senator Peter Walsh. He put this point very well in a speech he gave on the issue of accreditation just last month. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>That came from the government side of the political fence. I know of others presently in the cabinet and caucus who would endorse his views. As Peter Walsh notes, the measurement of quality is an inherently subjective process. The difficulty of prescribing quality is reflected in the mishmash of the 52 principles that make up the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quality Improvement and Accreditation System Handbook</EMPHASIS>. It is bureaucracy gone mad. There are other more nebulous concepts. They are not the worst aspects of the guidelines.

I do not think anybody would disagree with this. I acknowledge that the opposition concurs that child care is so vitally important within our community that it deserves to be of the highest quality. The dispute is about the linkage between fee relief and accreditation and the fact that it is not a voluntary process but a compulsory one.

A decision has been reached amongst the Greens, following wide consultation, with people both supporting and opposing the system, in Western Australia and on the east coast, to support the government's child-care quality improvement and accreditation system as long as there is an undertaking to conduct a full review of the improved system before July 1995.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for good quality child care and accountability for government funding means that we will not support the opposition motion of disallowance of ministerial guidelines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley has delighted in rubbishing my colleagues when they sought only to relate what was in the handbook. The following are direct quotes from the handbook, and I defy Senator Crowley or anyone else in the Senate to say that they are not there. The handbook states that a child-care centre is unsatisfactory if staff make sex-biased remarks about appearance, such as `That is a pretty dress', or `You are a handsome young man'. Principle 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff provide stereotyped toys such as trains, tip trucks and bulldozers for boys, and dolls and tea-sets for girls.</PARA>
<PARA>Principle 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff use `no' and `naughty'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Principle 7 further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff interrupt children's activities, expecting them to conform immediately to staff demands.</PARA>
<PARA>Principle 21 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are stencils and colour-in activities, which do not foster creativity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a constant repetition of Christmas songs as background at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It states that a child's care is only basic if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . songs are only for special occasions such as Christmas and are culturally irrelevant for many children.</PARA>
<PARA>These are all written in the guidelines for everyone to see, and they affect whether a child-care centre will qualify for fee relief. Removing one or two of these guidelines will not fix the problem. The whole thrust of the handbook is calculated so as to control every aspect of child care from one particular point of view.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me illustrate for Senator Crowley the extent of the control by quoting from principle 17. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to plan sensitively and appropriately for each child, it is essential to keep written development records to which all staff can contribute. Detailed development records allow staff to set goals for each child, devise strategies to achieve the goals, keep track of the child's progress and plan appropriate experiences for further learning and development. Every week, staff should closely observe some children during different activities and make a record of their level of development. Useful methods of recording observations include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a diary of incidental and anecdotal record (that is, descriptions of particular incidents or events and of general behaviour);</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an individual development log, divided into development areas such as physical, intellectual, social/emotional and language;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a development checklist, listing skills that can be expected of a child of a particular age. . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The learning experience planned for individual children should be incorporated into the program for the whole group.</PARA>
<PARA>One would think we are talking about a postgraduate program for elite Olympic athletes, not infants, toddlers and preschoolers. Why not make them wear brown shirts and send them all to kindy and be done with it, Senator Crowley? This is cradle to the grave type indoctrination, and close personal monitoring that would not be tolerated even in North Korea. What next, Madam Acting Deputy President? If child-care fee relief is tied to compliance with such regimes, what will the family allowance be tied to in the future? That is something we should all consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the costs. The second feature of the handbook that marks it for disallowance is that the government says these 51 principles and their hundreds of sub-commandments will cost a child-care centre 88c a week per child. This is based on a costing analysis of an earlier handbook. The consultants came up with a cost of $44 per child for a seven-week pilot study. They simply assumed then that the seven-week pilot program on which these costings were based was equivalent to a first year in an ongoing program. So they spread the $44 cost over 50 weeks and came up with a figure of 88c per child per week. However, ongoing costs, such as the need to provide consistency of care, which involves employing additional staff on an ongoing basis, could not have been included in the government costings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that the guideline accreditation process was pilot tested in a large number of centres, by which she meant 32 out of 2,265 centres, or 1.4 per cent of the population. Senator Crowley's consultants acknowledged that the conclusions which can be drawn from the surveys are limited by the very small sample. So that admission was made by the minister's own consultants. There was no audit of responses. Four so-called extreme cases were excluded from the costings of unpaid time. Therefore, 12.5 per cent of the centres surveyed were left out of the costings because they did not fit into the expected parameters. That is not a rigorous methodology and casts further doubt on the credibility of the final results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to remind the Senate of the previous minister's election promise, made three days before the election to private child-care centres, in a letter dated 10 March 1993. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No service will need to be required to put on new staff, increase qualified staff, buy new equipment or in any other way incur costs because of accreditation.</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked the current minister, Senator Crowley, to give a guarantee that the 1992 costings of 88c a week per child are comprehensive and accurate, given that they were based on a different handbook from that which is currently before the Senate, and they were drawn from an unaudited seven-week pilot study of 1.4 per cent of child-care centres. Senator Crowley has not been forthcoming with that guarantee, and I believe it is not likely that I will get it. There are significant differences between the two handbooks. Principle 51 in the current book specifically states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where several staff members work together, each of them should care particularly for an agreed group of children, so that each child receives consistent care from only one or two staff members.</PARA>
<PARA>Previously, the study had this restriction only for infants. Applying such staffing restrictions to all children regardless of age places a greater staffing cost on child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA>The government and the private child-care industry have both done independent costings on aspects of the child-care accreditation system, which I seek leave to table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Those costings have come up with vastly different results. The government claims it would cost 88c a week per child, while the private child-care industry claims costs would increase by $30 to $69 a week. This is due to new expenditure on primary contact staff, contract staff, direct operational costs and other indirect overheads and capital costs. Due to these large discrepancies, and due to the need to reassure parents and the private sector, I asked the minister last night privately&mdash;and I do so now in the Senate&mdash;whether she would consent to appointing a professional mediator, perhaps someone from Coopers and Lybrand, to bring the two sides together and work through their differences in order to arrive at common ground. Only then, after she has done that, can she tell the Senate that she has done her best to provide a facility that would get the two sides together. To date, she has not done that. I await her response to that call when she makes her contribution to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to raise one final point which the minister might clarify. In answer to my question earlier this week about the government's costings and why they were at such odds with the private sector's independent costings the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The private child-care sector and the opposition must appreciate that the staffing arrangements are not included in these figures to any large extent. The relief staff for the accreditation process is incorporated but the staffing arrangement Senator Boswell is talking to is a matter for states and properly does not belong in the accreditation figuring.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely, it is nonsense to say that these accreditation guidelines do not impact on staffing because staffing is a state matter. If a child-care centre wants to qualify for fee relief, it must meet the federal government guidelines, which will require greater staff expenditure. Principle 51 has significant implications for staffing levels which would send child-care costs soaring when applied to all age groups and not just to infants, as was the case in the earlier handbook. The Association of Child Care Centres in New South Wales commissioned, at considerable expense, an independent costing analysis of the quality improvement and accreditation system handbook. Those are the figures which I have tabled. They remain the only up-to-date and comprehensive costings in existence. They show that child-care costs would rise by $30 to $69 per child per week. Contrary to the minister's claims in the Senate the other day, the association has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the handbook has a substantial impact on staffing levels, rosters and expenditure. The private child care sector has not been adequately consulted about the accreditation system. How can we have been when we have only three voices out of 17 on the interim national accreditation council and only two out of 9 on the National Child Care Accreditation Council? The two honourable women chosen for their expertise in private child care have resigned from the NCAC due in part to the misrepresentation on behalf of the government. We and the parents of children we care for are extremely concerned that the costs of implementing all of these open-ended guidelines will rob parents of their freedom of choice and promote elitist child care.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a ringing disendorsement of Senator Crowley's accreditation plans. Senator Crowley must get an independent arbitrator to bring these two sides together. If she does not do this, she is putting a wedge between the child-care organisations and she is not being fair and honest. I call on Senator Crowley to appoint an independent arbitrator to examine the government's costings and those of the independent child-care centres. Someone must be wrong and someone must be right, or there must be some middle ground. I say to Senator Crowley that, if she is right, I will apologise to her in the Senate. If she is wrong, I would expect her to apologise to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to begin where Senator Boswell left off, because this whole issue of costings, I believe, has been misconstrued and, indeed, misunderstood. What these guidelines are doing is saying what the existing staff should be doing if they are going to provide good quality child care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states do have their regulations, and set out in those regulations are various formulae and various requirements with regard to staff. We need more than just straight numbers of people on the ground if we are going to have good quality child care. We have to look at what staff are doing, what the children are doing&mdash;indeed, what the toddlers and infants are doing&mdash;during the day. So these guidelines are not saying, `You have to appoint X, Y or Z extra staff'. They are saying, `The existing staff, who by state regulations already have to be there, should be involved as follows'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can suggest is that some people perhaps have not been following their state guidelines. Perhaps we might find some centres out there that will have to look at staffing because they have been finding ways around the current staffing formulas. I am told it is possible to do that in one state. I leave that up to those child-care workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress here that it is not the department that will be looking at how all this fits together and at how the centres are operating; it will be child-care workers who will go out and look at each other's centres. The centres themselves initially will have to have done their own reviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the whole problem of costings will gradually work itself through. As we are partly debating the reference of this issue to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I do not see how it will be possible for that committee to have either the resources or the time before 1 February to move around the countryside and check up on the state guidelines, asking people whether each centre is abiding by this or that state guideline, firstly, regarding the number of staff they are supposed to have on duty at any one time and, secondly, regarding the qualifications that that staff is supposed to hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of costings obviously will be very controversial. It will continue to simmer until the middle of next year when centres will begin&mdash;putting aside the hype, which I will deal with in a moment&mdash;to look realistically at what is in these guidelines and realise that they are probably following them already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me back to the process. This document was not drawn up in the back rooms of the department somewhere; it was prepared by the child-care people themselves. While some of us, including me, may have phrased it in another way and may not have gone to such lengths to set out options and to make fairly clear and succinct statements, that is not the way those people chose to do it. Surely we would be in as much trouble now if we said, `Oh, the minister has had a go at this and rephrased it all'. This is the phrasing and terminology that child-care workers are used to and what they feel comfortable with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the inconsistencies. The opposition says, `Yes, quality child care is wonderful; it is just that no-one is allowed to check up to see if it is happening'. The opposition is saying to parents, `You have to live with the quality of child care that you have. We think it should be good child care, but we will not give you any assistance as to what that child care should involve. We aren't going to help you at all'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such nonsense as cutting out Christmas&mdash;which I will deal with in a moment&mdash;is what parents are having great difficulty coping with. Of course parents are confused, thanks to the National Party, about what exactly is going on. Many of them are contacting their child-care centres, and hopefully those centres are giving them a look at this document&mdash;giving it to them to take away and to go through. When that happens, people realise that a lot of nonsense is being talked about by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning now to the guidelines, I start with principle 3 which Senator Boswell referred to earlier. Instead of selectively quoting, I will go through the process of looking at what is unsatisfactory, the basic requirements, good quality and high quality on the issue of toys. In principle 3 it says that it is unsatisfactory if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff provide stereotyped toys such as trains, tip trucks and bulldozers for boys, and dolls and tea-sets for girls.</PARA>
<PARA>Under basic quality, it says:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff consistently provide equal opportunities for boys and girls to participate in all activities, play with all materials, play vigorously on outdoor equipment, express a range of emotions and contribute to discussion.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there are no barriers determined by staff as to what is the appropriate toy for you or what is the appropriate toy for somebody else. Now we get to principle 7, which was also discussed earlier today, on the question of saying no. Let us look at the age group we are talking about. It says it is unsatisfactory in relation to infants as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff use `no' and `naughty' often, especially when children's interests conflict with staff's needs to accomplish routine activities quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that we are talking about infants&mdash;not toddlers or preschoolers. Let us look at the basic requirement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff allow some opportunities for exploration and early independence; e.g. let a child hold one spoon while they use another to feed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff use playpens for brief periods only (if at all).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff remain patient with children who remove clothes and resist dressing.</PARA>
<PARA>To go on to what is good quality for infants&mdash;and again I stress this is for infants&mdash;under principle 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff provide carefully supervised, safe opportunities for children to explore their environment with their mouths and hands, and more actively when they are able to crawl.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff allow children to hold spoons and make some attempts to feed themselves, when they show this desire.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, normal processes of development are encouraged. High quality includes the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff are very sensitive to the varying levels of competence of children and know when to offer choice and when not to, when to offer help and when to withhold it.</PARA>
<PARA>Now I come to Christmas. Let us look at what is unsatisfactory in principle 21:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a red herring; it is a very smelly fish, and it has a very relevant smell to this opposition campaign. I have said before to Senator Boswell&mdash;and he suggested in his comments that I was not telling the truth about staff&mdash;and I indicate again to him that he does not have it right. Let me just explain so that this matter is beyond confusion. There are state licensing regulations in most states and territories which all centres must pass before they can open. State licensing regulations apply well before anything to do with accreditation happens. State licensing regulations determine the number of staff, particularly the number of staff compared to the number of students. They have nothing to do with accreditation; they have everything to do with state regulations. Our accreditation guidelines do not address them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that is clearly understood by the opposition. What is more, the state government has its own group of people who go around and make sure that those licences are being complied with. All of the terrible things that the opposition accuses this government of doing have been happening in the child-care area for years at the state level, and no child-care centre has raised a major protest about it. They understand those state licensing regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I have put that too strongly, I accept that that might be a misinterpretation on my part. I do not believe so.

I do not find it consistent with what I know about Senator Herron that he would say things such as this government has a plot, secret or otherwise, to close down private centres. I will tell him why. Firstly, we have actually extended child-care assistance or fee relief to the private child-care sector. That is an extraordinary extension by this government, and that is where the major growth in government outlays comes from. It is quite inconsistent to extend the child-care assistance or fee relief to the private sector one day and then say, `But we did not really mean it'. That is such a nonsense. I assure those opposite and anybody listening that the government welcomes the assistance of the private child-care centres in providing child-care places to meet the huge demand still out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in this last budget we have extended special supplementary assistance to the private child-care centres. They had an allocation for 12 months. They now have an allocation for a further two years, which actually extends to the private child-care centre special assistance to help children with disabilities, children from non-English speaking backgrounds and children from Aboriginal communities or other isolated or disadvantaged areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government does not extend that kind of support to the private sector if it is about to close down the child-care centres. Indeed, the government is doing exactly the opposite. It is so willing to work in cooperation with the private sector that there is an indication of it. We do not confine that special assistance money to the community based. We have now just extended it to the private centres, not for the first time but with an extension on the amount of money and the commitment: a one-year pilot has now become a two-year funding through the budget. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Crowley,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I am writing to you to express my support for your position on the introduction of the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System and its linkage to Childcare Assistance funding. In doing so, I hope this gives you some indication that groups such as the Association of Child Care Centres of NSW (of which I am a member) and individuals with vested interests who are choosing to `bury their heads in the sand' are not completely representative of the views of private child care operators. Like yourself, I am appalled at the nature of the criticism being levelled at you, your department and the NCAC.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot accept the paranoid argument of some people, that the establishment of the NCAC and the introduction of the Quality Improvement and Accreditation System is a plot, influenced heavily by the unions, to remove private child care centres thereby dismantling the private child care industry, and returning the responsibility for the provision of all centre-based child care to the government and community-based organisations. No rational and objective consideration of the situation would support that point of view. Given the complexities of government child care funding I consider it totally reasonable that Childcare Assistance should be linked to accreditation. It is a fair and reasonable means of accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>The writer of the letter goes on to set out the work he has been doing to transform his child-care centre from that which it was previously&mdash;more a child minding centre than a child-care centre. The letter finishes:</PARA>

In using the guidelines&mdash;not dictatorial requirements&mdash;the industry, both community based and private, is assisted in knowing what constitutes accreditation.

Those opposite do not want to hear about this. The report back from those centres is that it is a very constructive process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be fairly brief because time is running out on this debate after that very longwinded contribution from the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). The minister gave the game away&mdash;this will be the theme of my comments. If a centre bans something, the minister will be there and she will fix it. I do not know whether Australians want a minister to have that sort of power over child care. It goes to the nub of what I wish to say. There is considerable tension about these guidelines, which explains the concern parents have. A lot of press comment has related to the authoritarian nature of the guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walsh, in his column in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a good old, longstanding Labor man, not a supporter of our side by any stretch of the imagination&mdash;said that the most obnoxious thing about the guidelines is the pervasive authoritarianism. That is why I referred to the minister's comments. Whether or not people know what is good for them, the Interim National Accreditation Council will see they get it&mdash;whether they like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister and a number of other speakers, including Senator Lees, have said, there is very widespread concern amongst parents about these guidelines. It is true, as Senator Lees said, that probably the vast number of those have not had the opportunity to read the guidelines. What has come through to a lot of parents is a feeling that child-care specialists and the government are starting to impose something on them. Naturally, they are starting to express that concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a parent who has had children in child-care arrangements and who has taken an interest in these things. Perhaps the key point which should have been expressed in the documents we have before us is that parental values are the most important ones. The values of the parents, which parents do their best to impart&mdash;taking into account the good care of children&mdash;are the values which have to predominate. In our free society, which is made up of very diverse groups, parents wish to bring up their children in a variety of ways. Any sensible, structured child-care arrangements will reflect that diversity of values in this community. Hence, when we start to impose guidelines which are as prescriptive as these we start to bump into those key values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are child-care centres which cater for Moslem children and, as somebody pointed out to me today, Jewish children. Those child-care centres will want to reflect the values of the parents. There are many parents who, broadly defined, I would say have fairly traditional views on how children should be brought up. They are happy to see their daughters playing with dolls and their sons playing with trucks. They never feel any fear or concern when their children come home and sing Christmas carols. In fact, they take great pleasure in it; just as I have in going to a child-care centre to see my daughter in a Christmas play. The problem lies with the authoritarian nature of these guidelines, and that is what parents are objecting to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Labor senators have what I would describe as pretty trendy views about child care. I am happy for their respective child-care centres to reflect their views. I do not want to intrude into how their children are brought up. But, equally, I do not want those opposite to intrude into how I want my children and grandchildren brought up. We are an increasingly educated, free and tolerant society. Therefore, in that sort of society there will be a diversity of views. It is that diversity which we genuinely have to cater for in child-care arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who drew up these guidelines were aware of this problem. I draw the attention of the minister to principles 16, 31 and 48. Each of those, in varying ways, tries to tackle this problem of parental values versus the values of the child-care experts. For example, the introduction says that staff should consult with parents when there may be a conflict between the centre's philosophy and family values. Other guidelines say that the philosophy of the centre has to be worked out between the values of the parents and the values of the child-care providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly not opposed to consultation. I have met many people with long experience and expertise in the child-care area whose advice I have been more than comfortable in accepting. But, at the end of the day, there will be serious conflict between the values of the parents and the values of the child-care providers at a particular centre in relation to quite a few issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should have been able to say to Australian parents, `It is your values which are the important values in child care. To the extent we are able, we will encourage child-care arrangements to reflect your values. Child-care providers are there to assist in providing the expertise, experience and advice. But, in the end, they are your children and it is you who must have the final say'. If that had been expressed in a clear, unequivocal way in this document&mdash;I do not say there is not an attempt to do that on one or two pages, but it is a very equivocal approach&mdash;the minister would have had none of this angst from the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community is right to be wary of any authoritarian attempts by government to impose a set of views and a set of values. In the end, we on this side trust the people; we trust the parents. It is our job to make sure that their values predominate. That is the difference between the government and the opposition. I do not deny that those opposite have spoken to people. Senator Zakharov was kind enough to tell me that, in her experience, there had been a degree of consultation with parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the bottom line is that the government came down on the side of what I would have thought were some fairly trendy views on bringing up children. The government has incorporated those views in the guidelines. That is why parents are getting upset. Australians today will not be dictated to by governments or by experts&mdash;child-care experts or any other type. We are an intelligent, proud people. We know what we want for our children. It is the government's job to reflect our values, not to impose its values on parents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pick up one point in the debate before expressing a view in relation to the possible reference of the matter to a committee. Parents do have access&mdash;and are guaranteed the ability to have access&mdash;to the accreditation process. The opposition has expressed the great desire that parents should be part of, and have a say in, the way that their children are brought up, including the kind of care that they receive. That is a very important principle and a very important part of the accreditation process. That seems to be what a minority of child-care centres are concerned about because they do not necessarily want parental access to their processes. If we want to make sure that parents do play a part in the process and in the type and nature of child care, the accreditation process is one way of doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Greens do not support the motion of disallowance in relation to the accreditation process, we will be willing to support a reference to the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, provided it is not required to report by 1 February 1994. We do not have any real means of finding out what is required of some child-care centres in financial terms in complying satisfactorily with the guidelines until the process has started and is working. We would support a referral to a committee six months into the program, rather than before we have adequate information as to what will happen and what is required in relation to staffing and administration costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense, we would support that reference to the committee only if it is realistic and will have the information upon which it can make an adequate assessment and then perhaps make any necessary changes.

What we  have is a politically correct way of bringing children up in accordance with a left wing ideological position which could be&mdash;and I suggest is&mdash;at great variance with the way in which parents tend to bring up their children. That is going to sow absolute confusion in the minds of children because these guidelines actually prescribe a particular way of raising children. There is nothing magical about what has been suggested in the guidelines. There is nothing that is of actual truth in those guidelines. They reflect a philosophical position.

We can go from a completely libertarian philosophy, where we put no controls on children, right through to an authoritarian position. Many educators over the years have argued for those various positions. There is nothing magical about any of them; they reflect a particular philosophical position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is incredibly dangerous about these guidelines is that they reflect one philosophical position and a position which is at variance with what a great many parents want. Let me go through some of those guidelines and show the Senate how  far away they are from what parents would normally do. One of the guidelines, that is stated as an unsatisfactory behaviour, is to interpret the making of a mess with food or throwing objects on the floor as naughty. Let me use that to illustrate a very basic point in the philosophical debate which has been going on in this area for many years. Dr Spock would have agreed with that and, of course, this was the way children tended to be raised in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in the United States. After advocating for 25 years the sort of view that children should be given total freedom and no restrictions, Dr Spock actually recanted and said that he was wrong. It was a bit late to explain that to a whole generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is Spockism gone mad because the government is advocating this lack of restriction. Modern psychology tells us that a child feels psychologically comfortable in an environment which has boundaries, which has certain rules and restrictions. It does not have to be overly restrictive; no-one would advocate that. But there have to be a few rules and restrictions. These guidelines go totally against that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They try to be gender neutral. The minister and I had a little altercation on this one. Let me give the minister some alternative examples to what she was saying earlier on. We have a situation where there has been a great debate in education in the area of nature and nurture. What determines human behaviour? Is it nature&mdash;in other words, our genetic disposition&mdash;that creates the behaviour, or is it nurture, the way we are brought up? What is coming out more and more strongly in the research is that it is nature, it is genetic. There are massive differences between boys and girls in that genetic make-up. We try to correct this by bringing in a set of toys and having the boys play with dolls and the girls play with trucks. How is that going to work out? Are they going to continue to do that? Is that a great thing to do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give the Senate an example from my wife's experience. She is a child-care worker. She was working with a feminist who decided that her children would be brought up in this gender neutral way. She gave her boy a doll and she gave the girl a truck. When she came back about half an hour later, the girl was making beds in the back of the truck and the boy had taken the doll apart to see how it worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of politically correct view that is expressed in that sort of unsatisfactory guideline is a nonsense. But the more dangerous thing is the fact that all these guidelines do is reflect a particular ideological point of view and one that is not representative of the community. I cannot understand how the minister can stand there and say that the National Child Care Accreditation Council, that has made up these guidelines, is in any way representative. All that it is representative of is a few trendy left-wingers who have drawn up these guidelines that are most inappropriate. Let me go through the list of who is on the council in terms of their backgrounds&mdash;not their names, but their backgrounds. There are eight people on this council. One is a consultant; three are child-care directors; one is an academic; two are bureaucrats; there is a mandatory trade unionist; but there is no representative of any parent group. Let me emphasise that again, and perhaps the minister will listen to this instead of rabbiting on over there. There is no representative of parent groups on this council that drew up this guideline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How a minister can be in a position to be presented with guidelines such as this, have the letters that have come in&mdash;that she has selectively quoted from&mdash;heard the debate that is going on in the community and not say to herself, `Hold it, we are on the wrong track; we need to go back and listen to people, listen to parents, and get this right' amazes me. She got up here today halfway through the debate&mdash;which absolutely amazed me; I thought she would have waited until the end when everybody had made a contribution. I thought that we were going to hear some really serious rebuttal arguments. What did we hear? We heard her reading out a series of selective quotes from some letters. Is this minister so empty-headed on this area that she cannot come up with cogent arguments to refute the case that we are making? The case that we are making is extremely strong. It is supported by great many groups of parents. It is extremely important that what parents want happens in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jesuits have said, `Give me a child till the age of seven and then that child can go forward'. The Jesuits realise that by that stage children will go the way in which they have been trained. This is an area where children's future attitudes can be determined by what they are taught. By the age of five, children will have learnt half of what they will learn in a lifetime. It is therefore extremely important not to socially engineer what happens in these child-care centres. If parents are paying for these facilities, they must have the right to determine what happens in them and not be dictated to by a group of people who only represent their own left-wing, outdated political philosophy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of Senator Boswell to principle 17, of which he was very critical. This principle states that the program should incorporate learning experiences appropriate for each child as indicated by individual development records maintained by the staff.

Those rules are the means by which a professional knows whether or not children are meeting their milestones&mdash;whether their fine motor and gross motor abilities are up to scratch, whether their communication abilities are what they should be, and whether their emotional, psychological and physical development is what it should be.

It is important that a child-care centre can discuss with the parents whether the child's development is within the normal range. These are the essential tenets of child care and childhood development. Most parents have some idea of the range of normal behaviour and wish to be able to discuss that range, and where their child is in it, with the child-care workers. Unless the child-care workers have carefully observed the child and checked the developmental dates within these checklists, they will have no idea what the child is doing. </PARA>

As someone who has spent a considerable part of professional life working in the early childhood area, I have no problem with these principles. I might have some problem with the wording but I have no problem with the principles that state: staff interactions with children should be warm and friendly; staff should treat all children equally and try to accommodate their individual needs; staff should respect diversity of background; and staff should treat both sexes without bias. Those are the sorts of things that parents expect their children to receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health and nutrition principles state that staff should be alert to the health and welfare of each child; that staff should try to ensure that children are clothed appropriately for indoor and outdoor play and for sleep; and that staff should ensure that food and drinks meet children's daily nutritional requirements and are culturally appropriate. For example, it is commonsense that it is not appropriate to serve a Jewish child a meal that contains pork. That is the sort of thing that one would expect these centres to be sensitive to. Of course, in saying that I am not suggesting that people are not acting inappropriately at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken with people who work in child-care centres.

Although I cannot speak for the opposition members on the committee&mdash;they are probably quite happy&mdash;I can speak on behalf of the government and Australian Democrats members when I say that, for reasons of our occupational health and safety, there is no way that we could physically deal with this reference. Furthermore, for reasons of the occupational health and safety of the committee secretariat there is no way that those people should be expected to be involved in such a reference at a time when they should be getting some rest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These accreditation guidelines represent authoritarian government and political correctness gone absolutely mad. The title of these guidelines should be, `How to have a politically correct child care centre, because if you do not, the government will cut you off'. I do not think honourable senators realise how absurd it is that the national parliament is discussing trucks, trains, dolls, what children will eat, et cetera, in child care centres across the country. We have a situation where a federal minister is setting herself up as the commissar of child-care, dictating what children will sing or listen to in child-care centres all over Australia. That is an utterly absurd situation which Australian people would rightly reject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These guidelines have been quite properly condemned right across Australia. It is quite inappropriate for the federal parliament to be dealing with these guidelines. They are another example of what a former Labor minister, Peter Walsh, described as Labor allowing:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . its child-care policy to be determined by a self-serving symbiotic coalition of feminist networkers, non-market service providers and early childhood services educators.</PARA>
<PARA>The notion that it is only the coalition that is raising concern about this issue is negated by the fact that a former senior Labor minister for finance has been the most ardent critic of this whole scheme. The coalition has not taken the lead on this. Peter Walsh, the former Labor minister, has taken the lead on this issue. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 21 September under the heading, `Childcare Mafia do it again', in referring to the accreditation scheme, Peter Walsh made a point which has not been dealt with by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My inquiries reveal that not only is there no Cabinet authority for that policy, Cabinet rejected it this year as it has done on at least two previous occasions. But it keeps cropping up again.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears that the ideologues who run that dreadful childcare division in the Department of Community Services have decided again to ignore any Cabinet decision with which they disagree.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is any residual commonsense in government, it should be used to close down the public sector service-provider-inspired National Accreditation Council, saving the $11m it proposes to squander over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of a former Labor minister for finance. I could not agree more and nor could any honourable senators on this side of the house. But, of course, the criticism does not come only from within the Labor ranks. People in the child-care industry have risen up against this whole proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most compelling letter I received&mdash;if we are into letters, let us have a look at some&mdash;was from the Sydney Rescue Work Society, an organisation which cares for 1,500 children per day in Sydney. That organisation has asked us to vote against the guidelines, and I will vote against the guidelines just on the basis of what it has said. It summed it up in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has not provided satisfactory evidence that this proposal will not increase costs and cause hardship to the lower paid, most vulnerable and disadvantaged parents.</PARA>
<PARA>This government which professes to stand for the workers of Australia is in fact through this scheme going to hit them the hardest. The letter further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government schemes that affect the community and have resource implications must ensure affordability, equity and accessibility. The proposals do not satisfy these criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>This very good letter then set out all the reasons why these proposals should be rejected. This scheme has also been attacked by the Australian Confederation of Childcare. Mrs Ann Young, the President of that organisation said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we are against is the Government's provocative insistence on bludgeoning centres into being a part of the scheme by threatening to withdraw fee relief from low-income families who send their children to a centre which is not part of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>How do you answer that? As a South Australian, I feel compelled to quote the President of the Association of Child Care Centres of South Australia, Mr Hayden Trewethick. He made the very good point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the guidelines would impact heavily on centres of Greek Orthodox, Catholic or Anglican influence where children were sent for specific cultural or religion aspects. "That takes away the parents' choice," Mr Tremethick said.</PARA>

How are they going to be enforced? If we look at the guidelines themselves&mdash;what we have been referring to in these 52 principles is simply a schedule to the guidelines&mdash;clause 18 actually talks about enforcement.

<PARA>What is an authorised officer? The interpretation clause at the start of the guidelines provides that `authorised' means authorised by the minister for the purposes of these guidelines. This is a ministerial directive. Again we come back to the commissar of child-care centres. These are politically correct guidelines that are going to be enforced by the minister's PC police, who can enter any centre at any time for any reason to ensure, presumably, that people are not playing Christmas carols too often. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What staggers me is that we have had this minister stand up and say that next year is going to be the year of the family and that what we want to highlight is diversity in families.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my humble view, the minimum standards, which we do support for child-care centres, are not a matter for the federal government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is next? If this is taken to its logical extreme, we are about to have parent accreditation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has denied there will be a problem, but I think down the track we must fear that the child-care rebate scheme will be linked to this accreditation scheme and that parents will get a child-care rebate only if they send their children to an accredited child-care centre.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the government does not support Senator Crowley on this matter. She has rushed ahead of her supply lines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far back as last year, the very powerful Labor Party caucus subcommittee on child care stated that there is a widespread feeling that, with regard to the child-care system in Australia, now we have got it right and there is no need to change it. Senator Crowley does not even have the support of the caucus subcommittee. I notice that she is leaving the chamber.

We on this side of the house would prefer to see someone else take it up, someone like Senator Reynolds&mdash;someone in whom the community has some confidence. Senator Faulkner, if he sticks around long enough, could take up that challenge in 1994. It is a chilling prospect to know that Senator Crowley will be overseeing the Year of the Family in 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point again, Madam Acting Deputy President, now that you are in the chair, that I will be referring a matter to the President for his consideration. I know what I have seen, and Senator Boswell knows what has occurred in this chamber. I refer to Senator Crowley's adviser. I think the matter should be taken up by the President. I signal the fact that I will be referring the matter to the President for his consideration. If nothing else, I would like a ruling on such matters that can be sent to the advisers and the public servants and that they be severely cautioned about it because next time, if not this time, it will be a matter of misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that Senator Crowley's handbook was conceived by a very small clique, governed by the minister, which does not have the support of the industry today. In fact, I noticed in a newspaper today that in the last 24 hours she has cobbled together a small team of supporters. It is a bit too late, I would say, because the extent to which the industry does not support Senator Crowley's handbook has been on the front page of every newspaper in this country. But she has managed to cobble together a group called the Coalition for Good Child Care. That group has been put together in the last couple of days to try to turn around the perception, to turn around the media debate. They are not representative of the industry. The group is made up of an ABC reporter and academics from TAFE colleges. Quite simply, it is not representative of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleagues have said, this is the worst case of social engineering to come out of the government. The government really has gone over the top this time. All the evidence shows that Senator Crowley's department is seeking to snatch the minds of children away from their parents&mdash;from those parents who dare to instil in their children views which are different from those of this government. As Senator Kemp said, the succinct point to be made is that it is the government control that everyone is seriously objecting to. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, there is more than one way to abuse children, and Senator Crowley's department has found the other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worse, as I said before, is that this minister is overseeing the Year of the Family in 1994, yet she in no way understands or is in any form connected with mainstream thinking and values in Australia. She should know that those mainstream Australian family values are rock solid against this handbook, and they will not be moved from that position. This handbook does no more than prove that a gulf has opened up between the Canberra thinking and mainstream Australia. If ever Canberra has been isolated, this is the best example yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I am talking about a mainstream family, that family could be a married couple with two children, a married couple with four children, a single parent with a child, or a divorced couple with a child. Those examples all make up the definition of a family, but in regard to each one of those four examples none of those parents would accept the values embodied in this handbook. No parent, as we know, accepts any of the rules or principles embodied in this handbook so long as they are handed down from on high by the government. I am talking about the four basic examples of what can make up a family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very sad day in this country when children cannot listen to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silent Night</EMPHASIS> without a government dictum on the matter. It is a very sterile play yard in which boys cannot play with tip-trucks. Yet that will be the effect of Senator Crowley's child-care laws. We know that for a fact because of the English experience, where there is a very similar type of handbook. The handbook in England is in a far more advanced state. The London Preschool Playgroups Association spokesman has admitted that Christmas has been abandoned in many of the child-care centres in inner London. Quite remarkably, he used a very similar defence to that of Senator Crowley. He said, `It is up to the individual groups to interpret these guidelines'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So long as a child-care centre's funding depends on those guidelines, it will err on the side of caution and interpret them in the way in which Canberra and the public servants want it to; otherwise, funding will be at risk. It is as simple as that. The example exists in England. Quite frankly, examples already exist in my state of Victoria&mdash;in a Coburg child-care centre where Christmas has been abandoned. When a centre's funding depends on obeying government laws, of course it is not going to risk the employment of many of the teachers or, indeed, the viability of the centre itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley says, `If Christmas is not being celebrated in any of the child-care centres, call me; get me on the phone'. Yet Senator Crowley has made no attempt to withdraw the mention of Christmas from the handbook. If she had a point to make in the handbook, could she not have made it without the best case example being that of Christmas? She obviously has no idea of the sensitivity of the issue. If she has a point to make, she should pull Christmas out and make the point in another way. That would be far more acceptable. But she has given no commitment to take out the word `Christmas'. She is still going to approve this handbook lock, stock and barrel, with the word `Christmas' contained in it. She will allow the interpretation to be such&mdash;as it has already been in many child-care centres; the best example being in England&mdash;that Christmas will be banned so long as she hangs the threat of funding over those child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the handbook to give credence to the argument regarding Christmas. Senator Lees conveniently left it out. It did not matter how many times we attempted to interject and point it out to her; she was quite determined to leave out the crux of this debate&mdash;that is, the unsatisfactory column in principle 21. A centre which comes under this column heading will find its funding in danger. According to page 53, it is `Unsatisfactory' if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a constant repetition of Christmas songs as background at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Christmas is celebrated only at the end of the year. It is an exclusive celebration in this country as it has always been throughout the world. It is accepted in all countries yet, incredibly, this is placed in the unsatisfactory column. Any teacher or parent could draw only one conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the basic column, which is the next category up and one category down from unsatisfactory&mdash;which is basically unsatisfactory in itself, and again Senator Lees did not put this in perspective&mdash;Christmas is mentioned as being `culturally irrelevant for many children'. So Senator Crowley cannot tell us she is not trying to shape Christmas in the way that she, or her department, wants it. If Senator Crowley wants to make a point or an example, she should pull the references to Christmas out of this handbook and treat it in another way; but she cannot tell us that she is not trying to reshape and socially engineer Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley might care to know that many non-Christian children enjoy singing Christmas carols with their friends. Asian nations that are not predominantly Christian understand and indeed celebrate Christmas&mdash;perhaps not in the true religious sense; but they recognise it as a world, particularly a Western world, celebration. Not even in the darkest days of communism was Christmas eradicated. If Senator Crowley truly wishes to eradicate the concern about Christmas, I again challenge her to take the word `Christmas' out of the handbook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley also used the argument that the handbook is no more than a set of guidelines for child-care centres. That argument is false. It is a desperate attempt to slip-slide away from the original aim of enforcement of the guidelines. Firstly, the principles to be followed are placed in four categories: unsatisfactory, basic, good quality and high quality. The allocation of funds will depend upon an assessment of the categories into which centres are placed. Every child-care centre realises that the money trail leads back to the minister's desk. Such centres will not risk their funding, nor the employment of their teachers, and so will attempt to place themselves in the highest category. While Christmas is placed in the unsatisfactory category, child-care centres will err on the side of caution and will choose to abolish Christmas so as not to risk an unsatisfactory assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the fact that the accreditation principles are linked to funding was confirmed by the National Child Care Accreditation Council Chairperson and Chief Executive, Quentin Bryce. She was in conflict with the minister when she said that in order to gain accreditation a centre would have to achieve a good quality rating in at least 32 to 52 of the principles. She is basically saying that a centre would have to get all 52 right if it really wanted its funding. At the very least, it would have to get between 32 and 52 principles right. A centre cannot receive an unsatisfactory rating in any of the principles if it is going to meet Quentin Bryce's classification. If a centre is going to get between 32 and 52 principles right, it cannot get one unsatisfactory category at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Guidelines for Determination of Eligible Child Care Centres tabled with the handbook clearly states that there is a linkage between funding and the handbook.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before, since this matter has come under public scrutiny, the minister has really found herself to be alone&mdash;except for a small clique of social engineers&mdash;in her support of this handbook. Senator Crowley has espoused the view that the accreditation principles have been formulated by the industry&mdash;how many times have we heard that from Senator Crowley&mdash;after broad consultation. The opposite is true and I make these points in support of my case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Child Care Accreditation Council&mdash;which is held up as a body at arms-length from government and which it is claimed sought industry views in compiling the handbook principles&mdash;has exposed itself as being very much in with this Labor government in its drive to manipulate the social agenda. Quite frankly, it is no more than a government lackey. I notice that the minister quoted from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>. To show just what a government lackey the accreditation council is, I refer to the fact that two of its members resigned in disgust and disappointment because there had not been broad consultation with the industry about this handbook. That is enough to give that council away; we have the inside word on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about the inside word, we also have the inside word on the government and support for Senator Crowley. It comes from former Senator Walsh. Former Senator Walsh really gives Senator Crowley away in a manner in which only he can&mdash;as those who knew former Senator Walsh would know. I will quote from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 30 November 1993. In that article, former Senator Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Crowley claimed last week the "industry had asked for the system". Last year I asked the previous minister how many requests for compulsory accreditation had been received from parent/users or managers of private sector centres which provide more than half the services. Answer: No records have been kept&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Former Senator Walsh adds&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which translated means very few or none.</PARA>
<PARA>So the industry was really not consulted at all. Senator Crowley has felt the heat of public opinion on this matter. In desperation last weekend at a Canberra conference she even lashed out at Australian women. I do not know why she thought Australian women would come to her defence but, quite incredibly, she lashed out at them. This was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. She said that Australian women were vicious and were unpleasant, and she said how disappointed she was that Australian women did not support her in this matter. This is a good example of Senator Crowley believing everyone thinks like her. She seems to believe all Australian women think like her, but the truth is quite the opposite. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With just a short time to go, I would like to match Senator Crowley's points in regard to newspaper articles and public opinion. But, first of all, I think the challenge before Senator Crowley&mdash;and she made a most disappointing defence of the handbook&mdash;is to culturally explain the meanings and aims of the book. That is what we are really after: a cultural explanation of the meanings and aims of the handbook. What is the cultural meaning and aim of believing that it is unsatisfactory to say, `That's a pretty dress you have on' or `That's nice' or `No' or `Naughty', or that it is unsatisfactory for boys to play only with tip-trucks and girls to play only with dolls&mdash;or, worse, the abolition of Christmas carols, that being the effect? Senator Crowley has to explain what she means by that culturally, but she will not go into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge Senator Crowley to explain to the Senate the meaning behind the handbook. The grave danger is that, with what she is doing, she is presenting moral confusion between the values of the home and the government and government funded child-care centres.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely this move calls for mass rebellion.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is very succinct. Kathy Djoneff says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Linking childcare payments to a set of conditions under which children are to be raised is the most insidious form of blackmail.</PARA>
<PARA>We have heard from the parents, we have heard from the children and we have heard from the associations that predominantly represent the child-care centres, such as the Australian Confederation of Child Care and the Australian Federation of Child Care Associations. We heard from other groups which represent the poorest of families&mdash;the Sydney Rescue Works Society and the Catholic Social Services, which describe the handbook linking to funding as `despicable'. We have heard from the two members who have resigned from the accreditation council. We have heard from petitioners and we have had phone calls. All honourable senators, from both sides of the chamber, if they are honest, would say that their offices have been swamped with calls regarding this matter. We have also received letters in our electorate offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Senator Crowley do? She has the numbers on the floor. That may be the case today but this has a long way to go. She still has to get the cooperation of those child-care centres for them to sign an agreement in relation to this handbook accreditation. I can tell her that they will rebel against that. They have lost confidence in the minister. They will not accept this handbook. They will call something similar to a coalminers strike&mdash;which would be very tragic in this country&mdash;in that the child care workers will refuse government funding, but that is the situation that they are fast being pushed into. I would like to know whether the minister will withhold their funding if they do not sign the agreement in relation to this accreditation handbook. The minister is not listening. She has not listened for the last three or four weeks. I do not think we will get much satisfaction until she is removed from her position and someone with more competence is put in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because much of the ground that needs to be covered has been covered. I would like to make a couple of extra comments. I have in front of me a document, the first sentence of which says, `When I die they can write what they like on my tombstone as long as it's not "she meant well"'. I am not as unkind as some of my colleagues on this side because I believe that the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), with all her intentions, means very well in this situation with regard to child-care guidelines. I am quite sure that Senator Lees means well when she speaks in defence of these guidelines, and Senator Chamarette when she talks about quality child care. But it is not a matter of just meaning well; it is a matter of the political philosophy that lies behind one's support or otherwise of these particular guidelines and the effect that they will have on a young generation of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak as a parent of three children. I have to declare that none of my three children ever spent time in a child-care centre. There were two major reasons for that. Firstly, 100 miles from the metropolitan area there was no child-care centre for those children to attend. A second and even more important reason was that, when my wife and I decided that we would like to bring children into this world, we believed that the best child care that those children could possibly have was being reared in a home by two parents who loved them and who wanted to make sure that the best that they could get out of life was provided for them. One may say that that is all very well if one can afford it, because current economic circumstances would suggest that there are a number of parents who can no longer afford to keep their children at home with one of the parents&mdash;either the father or the mother&mdash;spending the time at home to rear those children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1960s farming was not a very lucrative enterprise. We could scarcely afford to raise our children to the extent that we wanted to. But the overriding factor was that we believed that if we chose to bring children into this world we should do everything possible to make sure that we  accepted the responsibility of rearing those children. If we get to the situation where parents put their children into child care either by choice or because of economic necessity, which is sometimes quoted as the case now, I agree with Senator Chamarette when she says that we must be sure that we have quality child care for those children. Senator Chamarette used the word `quality' quite often during her speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My three children, none of whom spent any time in child-care centres, are either working in or have worked in child-care centres over the past seven years. Although they did not benefit from spending any time in a child-care centre, they have all worked in child-care centres. We speak regularly and they tell me what they think is appropriate child care for children who are required to attend child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with a lot of the things in the guidelines because they happen at the moment. They are only a statement of what actually happens in child-care centres right now. However, there are many things in the guidelines that I could not possibly agree with. The guidelines try to get uniformity in what we expect should be available to all children. To think that we should tie fee relief to accreditation for those child-care centres that follow the guidelines that the government has sought to get approval for is the worst way of making sure that we have what we want by way of care for our children in child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been led to believe that the quality of child care in Australia is currently considered to be amongst the best in the world. That is without these accreditation guidelines. I cannot understand why it is necessary in the first place for these guidelines to be put into writing so that the bureaucracy can check up and make sure that they are being adhered to by every child-care centre in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the child-care centres not provide the kind of environment that parents want for their children? The parents who place their children in child care have many different wishes for the care of those children. As our children get older we are allowed to choose to send them to a Christian school if we wish. We are also allowed to send them to a Muslim school or a Jewish school if that is what we wish to do. Parents are allowed to choose where they send their children in their later stages of education, so why on earth are we looking at this sort of uniformity in child care?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a parent, I may choose to put my young children into a child-care centre which insists on a stronger form of discipline. This may be different from what `modern' parents may choose for their children. I would not like the idea of my child being allowed to throw food on the floor as a form of exploratory behaviour. I would not choose that, so why should I not be able to put my child into a child-care centre where discipline is considered to be important?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kemp so ably said&mdash;and he was supported by Senator Tierney&mdash;why should not there be a diversity rather than uniformity in our nation which encourages multiculturalism and encourages all the other things that are different? Why are we looking at uniformity when in lots of other areas we are encouraging diversity? I believe that it should be the parents' choice. If they choose to put their child into a child-care centre, then they should be able to choose the type of child-care centre that they want and they should still be eligible for fee relief without that child-care centre necessarily passing all of the guidelines that are in this document of uniformity which this government is now trying to force on child-care centres throughout the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I agree with lots of the things in the guidelines because I think they are put in practice right now. I agree with most of those things which we would consider to be the norm in a majority of child-care centres, but which, according to the guidelines, are considered necessary to be put down in writing. Some of the extreme measures have been mentioned by my colleagues. I am sure that when some are put in practice, they will not be quite as difficult as they perhaps appear to be on paper. But I am quite sure that there are enough extreme measures to disturb the parents and the families of young children who wish to avail themselves of the use of the child-care centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are going beyond the pale when we start talking about authorised officers going into child-care centres to make sure that the guidelines are being adhered to. I think it is going too far to have authorised officers who can go into a child-care centre and make sure that all of those things that this government thinks are good for rearing children, including behavioural situations, in child-care centres are being adhered to. I hate to think that we would ever get to the day when we have a commissar for child care. It seems as though these guidelines are heading in that direction and it is typical of the sort of bureaucratic involvement that this government would like to have in relation to the standards of child care in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to speak any longer because most of the issues have been covered, but I wish to stress strongly the idea of parents' choice. Parents should be able to send their children to child-care centres which give them the sort of care and control that they would wish to give them in their own homes. If that choice cannot be left to the parents, then I think that these guidelines for accreditation should be strongly opposed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the comments of Senator Ferguson. I have a couple of grown-up daughters who are working in the child-care industry. I also have grandchildren who attend child-care centres. I have taken the opportunity of discussing these guidelines and the quality improvement and accreditation system handbook principles with a number of people, including those whom I have mentioned, but the guidelines do not attract any support at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not criticising or questioning for one moment the genuineness or goodwill of the people who have drafted these principles. I am not questioning the integrity of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). I simply think the guidelines are foolish and, worse than that, I think they will impact adversely on the poor; they will prejudice the poor. Bureaucratic costs will necessarily be passed on to the child-care centres. These will be passed on to the poor benighted parents, many of whom are struggling because of the policies of this government. Many families are now unable to make ends meet on one income. Therefore, they do not have a true freedom of choice to do what Senator Ferguson was saying many desire to do, which is to have one of the parents in the home, nurturing and caring for the children full time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Survey after survey has shown that many persons are forced out into the paid work force when their desire is to predominantly involve themselves in the full-time care and nurturing of their children in their own homes. This has been denied to them by the actions of this government and successive governments. Of course, this is not the time to argue that case. These regulations are just another example of the costs being passed on to those families who need the services of child-care centres. That factor needs to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor that has been canvassed by quite a number of honourable senators is the need to distinguish between the desire to have top quality child-care institutions and the introduction of compulsory patterns of child care, tying them to the child-care rebate. Once we go along the latter track, we open the way for the bureaucratic control of the children of this country and we take away the rights of parents. That approach has been met by an absolute barrage of condemnation. That is why these principles that are contained in the document that is before us have met with such opposition. The very suggestion that the state will involve itself in the control of the children of Australian parents has met with a justifiably angry reaction by those parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the opposition, including Senator Herron, on moving this motion. I believe it is time that the government took a step back and reconsidered what it is doing in this area, reconsidered the principles that are contained in this document and reconsidered the tying of accreditation of child-care centres with the payment of rebates to parents. The government should distinguish between those things, but it has not. It has chosen to do it in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are quite a number of members of the government who do not agree with the tying of accreditation to the payment of the child-care rebate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, Senator Harradine. I want to address the Greens because they have a significant part to play in the determination of the vote that will occur. At this very late hour, I make a plea for them to consider their position. They have asked for and got the minister's agreement for a review in six month's time. Surely they realise that the horse will have bolted in six months time. Again, it will be the minister judging the minister's actions: Caesar judging Caesar. How can we expect an independent review under those circumstances?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have moved that this legislation be sent to the Community Affairs Committee so that it can look at the disparity between the cost per week per child of 88c arrived at by the minister and the cost of $30 arrived at by the independent consultant's review.

There are none so blind as those who do not wish to see, and she has taken no notice. A course has been set for her. I was screamed at by her adviser in the box because I implied that she did not know what was going on. I have reconsidered my position. It is not the place for advisers to engage in debate in this chamber. </PARA>

As all honourable senators would be aware, Australia's transport system is undergoing a process of fundamental reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deregulation of domestic aviation has produced significant positive results for Australia. The waterfront and shipping reform programs and the establishment of both the National Rail Corporation and the National Road Transport Commission are changing the face of transport in Australia. These changes, which followed decades of neglect by conservative governments in Australia, will now allow us to focus on the transport system as a whole for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is determined to improve the efficiency within and between each link of the transport chain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing the task force, the government was very conscious of ensuring that it was industry and user oriented and this is reflected in the paper.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask for all of those interjections to be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, Mr President! I am afraid that, essentially, this boils down to a semantic question, as so many of these things do. There was a clear assurance, for example, by the Malaysian High Commissioner as late as 4 December that Malaysia's earlier comments did not constitute a formal diplomatic protest. That was certainly our understanding of the nature of the communications at the time that they were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is the case that Dr Mahathir on 3 December characterised these earlier expressions and Malaysian views as having been a protest, and I guess we are obliged to accept his characterisation of it. It is the case that views can be expressed through diplomatic channels&mdash;either orally or in writing&mdash;in a number of different ways and at different levels of intensity. Hitherto, I think the understanding of what constituted a protest was that which was defined as such at the time that it was made, or which in some other way had that character very clearly about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expressions of concern are a lesser form of diplomatic communication. They are very common in this business, again, at varying levels of intensity, and it is really a matter of semantic choice as to how one chooses to go about it.

In those circumstances, why did the formal release put out on 2 December make no mention at all of the fact that, at almost the highest levels, there had been a former protest recorded?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that Senator Alston derived that impression, or says now that he derived that impression, from the press release is a matter for him. The fact is that we were making the point that there had not been, as we understood it, a formal protest lodged at that time, and we said so. It is not to be assumed from that that there have not been other diplomatic communications. Of course, in the circumstances of the situation, there was likely to be&mdash;and anyone who knew anything about the nature of diplomatic dialogue would have assumed that there would have been some communication about it, and certainly something in the nature of expressions of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project has been an outstanding construction effort.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague Senator Collins for his advice in answering this question. The question that Senator Jones raised is one that relates to a project by the Office of Multicultural Affairs which has already developed into a major success though it is relatively new. The project is one which, through poster form, through the avenue of the visual image, aims to reflect in a very simple and vivid way different aspects of Australia's unique cultural diversity. The government's position, of course, is that one of the major resources of this country is the diversity of our people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As any educator or advertiser would know, visual image is a highly effective and powerful way of getting across a positive message to the widest possible audience. In that respect, the poster series is aimed at getting across to as many people as possible the resources that we have and possess as a nation because of our diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The series started last year. The first poster was an artwork done by the Aboriginal artist Sally Morgan. The poster was commissioned by OMA and was launched in May 1992 by Minister Hand. A sign of the success of the project is that some 10,000 copies of the poster were produced. They presented a quite vivid image of our Aboriginal heritage and, of course, the vital contribution that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are continuing to make to our society. The posters have proved enormously popular not only with community groups but with individuals throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I had the opportunity to launch the second poster of the series at the National Gallery of Australia. This time the artwork was the work of the well-known artist Salvatore Zofrea, who migrated to Australia with his family from southern Italy in 1956. Once again, the same number of posters will be produced and made available from the Office of Multicultural Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as launching the poster and pushing this particular series to raise our society's awareness of our diversity and the resources that we have through that diversity, I was also able to present the original watercolour of Salvatore Zofrea's work to the Director of the National Gallery of Australia, Betty Churcher. That particular work depicts, as one would imagine, not only the participation of non-English speaking background European migrants to Australia but also how much and how many of their cultures they have brought with them and how those cultures have now been factored in to become very much part of Australia's everyday way of life.</PARA>

This position reflected a feeling on the part of the US that the resolution should have appointed a special envoy to supplement the mandate of the UN special rapporteur, Professor Yokota, called for a voluntary arms embargo and urged UN agencies to ensure funding does not support the SLORC. While Australia would have been prepared to co-sponsor a resolution  containing these additional points&mdash;we had no problem with any of them&mdash;we accepted that such a resolution stood little chance of being adopted by consensus, and adoption by consensus is important in the UN third committee context in that it sends a very clear signal to the SLORC about the breadth of international concern over the situation in Burma, including on the part of countries within its own region.

This represents the culmination of a relatively lengthy period of consultation between the 17 signatories in which Australia, I am pleased to say, has taken a leading role. It will result in the implementation and enforcement of more stringent and uniform ship inspection standards and emphasise the importance of training for regional ship surveyors and inspectors. It also provides for information to be exchanged between participating states and with countries participating in the European agreement.</PARA>

The article was, of course, badly crafted and appallingly researched. It was neither coherent nor informative and was factually incorrect on a number of points. I should observe in passing that the article referred in one paragraph to a senior Liberal. The anonymous senior Liberal, of course, was a thoroughly forgettable, inconsequential junior Liberal with a short political life expectancy.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Ms Crisp</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your article <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Numbers Man from the Shadows</EMPHASIS> November 16 was neither balanced nor accurate. The author quotes an outrageous smear of me made by former Senator Walsh under parliamentary privilege without reporting that he was subsequently censured by the Senate for deliberately misleading the chamber over another incident in which he sought to again falsely smear me. The motion was carried with the support of Don Chipp and the Democrats. One of Senator Walsh's colleagues, subsequently a senior minister in the Hawke and Keating governments, advised me he would not again vote to support Walsh on any future such occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your article speculates about whether John Hewson asked me to join his front bench and then proceeds to manufacture a rumour to the contrary. My invitation for your author to ask John Hewson was ignored. To have asked John Hewson would have put paid to your rumour and exposed the dishonesty of your source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not, as your article claims, mention contributing to Richard Court's leadership. I referred to my modest contribution to his premiership, a distinction not too subtle for most.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your account of Withers and McLean going north with membership lists and discovering "there were dead people, people who'd left town years ago, branches that never existed" is a total fabrication. It is not without significance that the source of the concoction is not named. The reason for that is all too obvious. The article implies that the proposition was put to me by the author but of course that is simply not true.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The article makes much of the Floreat State seat election without even an elementary understanding of events. Dr Constable was assured success at the last election, when the Liberal Party endorsed 64 year old Dr Jecks, a circumstance caused by one of the largest constitutional Liberal branches in the electorate being disqualified from sitting on the pre-selection, occasioned by the failure of the branch to provide the State Director with the branch's pre-selection delegates within the prescribed time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your reference to the former Liberal Senator Sim ignores the fact that, after 16 years of accepting Liberal Party endorsement, he supported Dr Constable in both the bi-election and general election against the endorsed Liberal candidate. He has not for some time been a member of the Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, your reference to suggestions that I used a private trust to win favour with branches through gift membership is both utterly untrue and libellous.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was referred to me over the lunch break, so I was able to prepare a statement. During debate on the motion of disallowance relating to the child-care guidelines, it was alleged by opposition senators that an adviser in the ministerial advisers benches had directed an interjection to opposition senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that any such behaviour by advisers in the advisers benches or by any person in any of the galleries is grossly disorderly and the chair may order the withdrawal or removal of any offenders. Past rulings on this matter are referred to at page 951 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>. Advisers who are assisting senators from the advisers benches have a particular obligation to behave with complete decorum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West, who was in the chair at the time, indicated that she did not believe that the adviser concerned had behaved in the manner suggested, and of course I am not able to say whether the incident occurred as alleged because at the time I was chairing a meeting of the Australian Political Exchange Committee. I am simply ruling on a question of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the same debate it was suggested that I should rule on a request made to Senator Herron that he withdraw a statement to the effect that Senator Crowley had made misleading statements. The relevant principle here is that senators must not make statements in debate which assert or imply that another senator has deliberately or knowingly made untrue statements. Rulings of past presidents and rulings made by Deputy President Colston, as he then was, on 15 October 1991 and by me on 9 December 1992 have made this quite clear. Statements that other senators' statements are not true or misleading are not necessarily out of order; for the chair to intervene there must be some implication that a senator has deliberately or knowingly made untrue statements. It is for the chair to judge whether this implication is present in any particular instance. The questions referred to me by Senator Panizza are matters for the chair and I hope that this ruling is taken note of. </PARA>

But it is important, when these things are drawn to the attention of the chair&mdash;as this was by a number of people on this side of the chamber&mdash;that the adviser at least be informed by the chair that such behaviour is out of order and be asked to desist immediately.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate censures the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his failure to take appropriate action to prevent the increasing and continuing damage to Australia's relations with Malaysia, Australia's standing in Asia and Australia's significant trade with Malaysia, arising from his intemperate remarks concerning the Malaysian Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion today more in sorrow than in anger. But it is the view of this side of the chamber that the Senate must protest the action taken by the Prime Minister, which has resulted in severe and ongoing damage to Australia's interests&mdash;particularly to Australian business interests, which have been working for years in a difficult environment to build trade and investment links with Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few days we have put before the Senate a whole series of complaints that have come in from concerned Australian businesses. I mention just a few of them without going through the details again: McKerrell Lynch, Champion Compressors Ltd of Victoria, SEAS Sapfor of South Australia, Voxson International of Brisbane, Jakab Industries of Tamworth, AWA industries, major power generation projects in Malaysia, soft furnishings interests, and Bufori Motor Company of Sydney. I could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our faxes are running hot&mdash;no doubt Minister Evans's fax is running hot as well&mdash;from complaints by Australian business men and women who are distraught about the damage that is being caused to their interests as a result of the irresponsible statements by the Prime Minister. It is a demonstration of his arrogance and ineptitude. He is an ego driven Prime Minister who put that ego ahead of Australia's interests and in Seattle decided, because he thought he had done pretty well out of the APEC conference, that it was time to take a slash at the Malaysian Prime Minister. It was totally gratuitous, as I said the other day. It was a gratuitous indulgence that has done nothing but cause harm to Australia's interests, and for that he should be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, he and his government should be condemned for the fact that they have taken so little constructive action since that default in trying to put the situation right. We would not be moving in this direction today if we had seen constructive, positive action from the Prime Minister, and from his Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), subsequent to this stupidity to try to put the matter right. But we simply have not seen that occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the Senate cannot stand by today and simply watch Australia's relationship with Malaysia deteriorate. It  particularly cannot stand by and watch Australia's business interests in Malaysia suffer without voicing its protest in the strongest terms. I remind you, Mr President, that this is the Prime Minister who said that it is in Australia's interest to engage Asia. This is the Prime Minister who said that it is in our interest to be accepted as part of Asia. He is the Prime Minister who said that this was a principal goal of his government. Yet we see this evidence of a total lack of understanding of the sensitivities relating to the region as demonstrated by him in Seattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it should not come to us as a surprise because  this was the Prime Minister who went to Indonesia and apologised for our constitution and the flag. This was the Prime Minister who said overseas, in the region, that we had to modify our attitude to human rights to fit within the region. Yet this is the Prime Minister who so conversely, nevertheless, feels that he can get away with a bit of personal abuse against the Prime Minister of one of our regional neighbours simply because it suits his political purpose of the moment. Reckless, insensitive, stupid: all these words must apply to the action that the Prime Minister took. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Prime Minister is disappointed about Malaysia's attitude to APEC. The facts are that Malaysia has a different point of view. It believes in the development of an Asian organisation and that that would be of greater benefit to Malaysia than APEC. We have a different point of view because we would be excluded from this Asian organisation. We believe that, if we could link Asia with North America in particular, then that is more to Australia's benefit. Both are legitimate points of view. So it is quite reasonable for the Prime Minister to be disappointed that the Malaysian Prime Minister did not turn up at Seattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what should he do about that? He can, obviously, if he had any sense at all, take the diplomatic path and try to work towards engaging Malaysia within the project that he sees as of Australia's interest, and so do we&mdash;encouraging Malaysia. As Senator O'Chee will know, the next meeting of the leaders of APEC was to be held in Indonesia and, because of the solidarity of ASEAN, there was every possibility that the Malaysian Prime Minister would attend in any event. So within a year or so there could have been a positive move in a direction that would benefit Australia. But what has he done?  He has ruined all opportunity of that occurring, and that is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made a statement that could only be seen as damaging Australia's interests, what action did we then see from either Mr Keating or Senator Evans? The first reaction, of course, was to simply dismiss it. When it was put that Dr Mahathir would have been disappointed with his attitude, the Prime Minister's response was, `He is in the business of feigned indignation'. How would that help a problem that was already on the table? Again, it is a typical response of Prime Minister Keating. He should have recognised that he needed to be conciliatory and that he had been in error&mdash;and hopefully his Foreign Minister was telling him that he was in error, that the relationship with Malaysia had always been a tricky one and it was in our interest to demonstrate sensitivity. That is what they do not seem to understand&mdash;it is in our interest to demonstrate sensitivity in building that relationship because we are seeking to gain advantage from that relationship. But instead of recognising that need to be conciliatory, he took another slash at the Malaysian Prime Minister and suggested that it was simply a case of feigned indignation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was the response of the Australian Foreign Minister?  It seems in the first instance that there was not simply any response at all. It is astonishing to those of us on this side of the table that it has taken until now before the Australian Foreign Minister has been prepared to pick up the phone and ring his counterpart in Malaysia and say, `We have to find a way through this problem'. It is disgraceful that the problem has to wait until all of these Australian businesses complain that they are now losing contracts and losing opportunities&mdash;today we heard that business visas are not being granted&mdash;before the Australian Foreign Minister is prepared to get on the phone and see whether he can do something about it. As I said, we really find this a depressing situation. If the Australian government had taken action after the stupid comments of Mr Keating and genuinely sought to put the situation right, we would not be here moving this censure motion today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I draw your attention to the press release that the spokesman for the Prime Minister put out on 2 December 1993. This was the statement issued after the Prime Minister had apparently written a letter to the Malaysian Prime Minister. In effect, in this statement he implies that it is equally Malaysia's responsibility to sort this problem out as it is Australia's. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Governments need to avoid a situation in which the media is setting the tone . . . We hope that both Governments will act in a way which clearly draws a line . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He is not recognising that he is at fault and saying, `I acknowledge that and I now want to put the relationship right again'. He is saying, `It's the other side's fault as much as it's mine'. Mr Deputy President, did you see the explanation? It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's remarks in Seattle were not calculated to give offence to Dr Mahathir. </PARA>
<PARA>Very good. It then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather, they were made to make clear that it was a decision for Malaysia, and Dr Mahathir, if Malaysia wished to absent itself from the APEC meeting and that Australia had clear design interests in the architecture of APEC, interests which it would defend vigorously.</PARA>
<PARA>What he is trying to do is explain away his personal abuse by saying that we have a right to defend our interests in APEC. That is not the way in which we seek to defend our interests in APEC. Even Mr Keating, I would have thought, should have known that&mdash;and, above all, Senator Evans should have known it. But Senator Evans has mysteriously kept out of it from the start. In effect, he was not prepared to say that he had done anything at all, until yesterday. Today, finally, under all the pressure, he is prepared to pick up the phone. Why has not the Australian Foreign Minister sought to help and get Australia through this very difficult situation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have agreed to a strict time limit of 10 minutes each and my time is just about up. As I said, we have moved this motion because we think it is important that the Senate registers its protest. It is important that the Senate say to the Prime Minister and his government that their conduct in this matter has been appalling, that they have let Australian interests down and that they must now do something about it. Instead of Prime Minister Keating locking himself away in his room and hoping that this problem will go away, he must genuinely do something about bringing it to an end. Unless we add our voice to the Australian business people who are suffering so much as a result of Prime Minister Keating's ineptitude, it would seem that little is going to be done. I trust the minority parties will support this motion&mdash;I know the government will not&mdash;and that we will send a clear message to Prime Minister Keating that he has let Australia down and that we now demand action from him to put right what he has done wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a misconceived motion of censure whose timing is absolutely appalling. We have a problem with Malaysia, and that is self-evidently so. Some commercial damage has already been caused as a result of that problem. A good deal more such damage is feared. As a government and as a nation, we are extremely conscious of that, but the point that needs to be appreciated is that we are trying very hard to solve the problem as a government. Diplomatic channels are open&mdash;they have never in fact been closed. Ministerial lines of communication are well and truly open through the presence of Senator Ray in Malaysia at the moment and just recently in the case of Senator Cook and through my own communication since I have been back from overseas this week. We are working overtime to try to contain the problem, to resolve it in a mutually acceptable way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing at this stage is to keep the atmosphere cool, not to inflame it. The important thing is to pause for reflection, not for breast beating, angst or political point scoring. This is the kind of point that I have sought to make to my Malaysian colleagues&mdash;the virtues of a pause and not to let the situation get inflamed and escalate out of control, as situations such as this so often do if they are contributed to by inflammatory statements. If that is a message that we want to deliver and have accepted and understood on the Malaysian side, it ought to be a message that is capable of being understood, appreciated and accepted  on the Australian side. This is not an occasion to be inflaming the debate. It is an occasion for cooling the debate. It is an occasion not for political point scoring but for reflecting on the nature and the value of the relationship that we have with Malaysia and the importance of that relationship not being disturbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to make again the kinds of responses to the opposition's point scoring that I have already made in question time. I think they speak for themselves. The truth of the matter, however, needs to be briefly recalled that at the time that Mr Keating made his remarks in Seattle there was an expression from the opposition side not of outrage, not of indignation, not of belief that something calamitous had potentially happened, but of understanding. Members of the opposition said that this was not the time to be making political capital. They said, `We understand the context in which these remarks were made and, in effect, we could have understood ourselves making them had we been there in that same situation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing that has changed since 23 November when those remarks from Mr Peacock and Mr Fischer were reported has been, of course, the fact that over recent days in particular the situation has rather deteriorated with Malaysia. There has been a perceived capacity on the part of the opposition to score a point or two against the government by berating us for all the things that are mentioned in the censure motion. Of course, that initial understanding that was so clearly on the public record about the circumstances of Mr Keating's statement has now totally evaporated in a cacophony of rather crude political abuse and point scoring that we are hearing from the other side. That is a matter for regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign policy is best conducted, if it is humanly possible&mdash;I know that it is not always&mdash;in a spirit of bipartisanship and genuine understanding of what the national interest of this country is. I repeat that the national interest of this country at the moment is not in having a self-indulgent political debate but in having a clear, reflective approach to this issue which effectively communicates to the Malaysian side how much we value this relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear on the record right now how much we value the relationship and all the different component parts of it. We value the defence relationship that has existed for so long. We have always been committed to the security of the country and we have demonstrated that through our involvement in and the reaction to the communist insurgency and by, of course, in years subsequently, our involvement and participation in the five-power defence arrangement. We are committed in the most fundamental way to the future security and existence of that country. We have demonstrated that in the past. We are perfectly prepared to go on demonstrating it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to the economic development of the country. For years we have made quite substantial development assistance support available, particularly through the education sector and, more recently, through commercial infrastructure developments as well. We are happy to keep on doing that so long as Malaysia remains a country with disparities in income and has a need for that kind of development support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a very strong commitment for over 30 years, through programs of one kind or another, to the education, either publicly scholarship supported or through private educational processes, of Malaysian kids coming to this country. More than 100,000 graduates of Australian educational programs are now living in Malaysia. There is an enormous reservoir of personal goodwill on both sides as a result of that heritage, and that is something we want to nourish, support and sustain.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 85,000 Australians who were actually born in Malaysia are now full-time residents or citizens of this country. That is a contribution to this country that we value and is a product of the value of that fundamental relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have these days a very substantial economic relationship with Malaysia. The size of the trade account is over $2 billion. The investment stock is growing all the time, particularly in terms of Australian investment in that country of significant measure, joint venture, or Malaysian activity, in Australia. It has been very much to the benefit of both countries that that economic relationship has developed as it has and, of course, it is a relationship that has been exploding in intensity and value and in the nature of the commitment over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter for reflection not just on the Australian side as to what will be lost in commercial and economic terms if our relationship should now deteriorate. It is also a matter for appropriate reflection on the Malaysian side. A point that needs to be borne in mind by our Malaysian counterparts as they consider their reaction to these circumstances is just what the implications of allowing this situation to further deteriorate will be. The Malaysians may lose future Australian investment, which is the kind of thing they have been very much encouraging hitherto in an environment where the investment targets that have been set in the last year or two have not quite been satisfied, not least as a result of the increasing competition for investment capital elsewhere in the region. They run the risk also on the Malaysian side of losing the transfer of Australian technology, which has been one of the fundamental advantages that have been derived so often from Malaysian business association with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the biggest risk of all, however, if this political or diplomatic disagreement is allowed to get to the point of fundamental deterioration in relations and economic embargoes, boycotts or whatever, the fundamental point that has to be contemplated on the Malaysian side, is the implications of this in terms of demonstration effect to other countries and investors in other countries who may well be minded to think very clearly about the risks of incurring really serious economic problems as a result of political problems arising in the relationship. That is not a message I think any country should be comfortable in giving elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention those points just in passing. I do not particularly want to dwell upon them or dwell in any other way on the possible disbenefits for the Malaysian side that might flow if we get forced into some kind of crazy tit for tat retaliatory situation in the future. It is something that in both our interests we should be wanting absolutely to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked only about the elements of the bilateral relationship. I have not talked at all&mdash;I could at considerable length but I will not, given time constraints&mdash;about the other kinds of cooperation that we have had with Malaysia over the years. I could talk about the way in which we have worked together to develop a new regional security dialogue, using in particular the mechanisms of the ASEAN consultative process, and the way in which we have worked together to establish the new ASEAN regional forum which will open up its first meeting next year. I could talk in terms of the way in which we have worked together in APEC, notwithstanding some of the difficulties that have been felt about full-scale embrace of that by the Malaysian leadership. As I have said in this place and elsewhere, there has been an extraordinarily constructive working role played by Malaysia in the development of APEC through the working groups, the committees and the other processes which have done the actual nuts-and-bolts work for the development of that emerging new regional organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had tremendously cooperative relations with Malaysia in response to a whole variety of regional problems of a non-security or non-economic kind: for example, environmental issues, narcotics trafficking, reaction to terrorism, piracy and, in particular, the treatment of refugees&mdash;unregulated population flows&mdash;in the region. There is an enormous body of shared experience through the Commonwealth that is part and parcel again of our relationship with this country. All of these things are very important to reflect upon at a time like this; to reflect upon in Australia  in a positive and constructive way and to reflect upon in Malaysia, I hope equally in a positive and constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances which led to the development of this difficulty are well known. The statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) under the tail of a Boeing 747 aircraft in the Everett factory in Seattle, in circumstances that I and the Prime Minister have been at pains to spell out, should be understood in the context of the particular occasion. As I said in this place earlier this week, the Prime Minister had in fact been asked on numerous previous occasions about his attitude to Dr Mahathir's non-appearance at Seattle. On each occasion he had replied in absolutely neutral terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 November, in the statement that this motion inappropriately characterises as intemperate, the question was put to Mr Keating in the form of a request for comment on a reported statement that morning in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> by Dr Mahathir that `perhaps you have to thumb your nose at people before they notice you'. Mr Keating's reply did emerge on this occasion perhaps a little more sharply than it had on earlier occasions. But if it did so, it was clearly in response to the particular circumstance with which he was confronted: repetitive, aggressive questioning and a particular quote which did have a whiff of provocation about it which I think would be acknowledged by even the most objective observer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our diplomatic response accordingly in dealing with this issue when it first arose and when it first became clear that there was some concern on the Malaysian side&mdash;although we thought not such as to be producing anything in the nature of a formal protest, a point that we talked about earlier in question time today&mdash;was to make clear, through statements that I made and the general messages that were delivered at a diplomatic level, that there had been no intention to cause offence on this occasion, that the context in which the remark had been made should be clearly understood and we hoped that our mutual commitment to the value of the relationship would be such as to ensure that no real problems ensued and that we could draw a line under this particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reply by the High Commissioner to the letter that initiated all this from the UMNO Youth Organisation was delivered in the first few days. We had hoped that that might be enough to restore normality to the situation. The response was a cautious, a careful, a low key one. It was not a negligent or negligible response, but it was certainly cautious and low key. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it became clear in the course of last week, the second week of this matter, that it was necessary to take some further steps to explain Australia's position, Prime Minister Keating did, in fact, write to Dr Mahathir. He wrote in a way that made very clear that what he said was not calculated to cause offence. That language was starkly clear in the text of the letter. It may be, as I said earlier this week, that the rest of the letter was not as fulsome as might possibly have been thought appropriate on the Malaysian side. If that were so, I think that should be understood against the context of the total situation as it prevailed by then, which had involved a lot of statements coming from the Malaysian side and which had been, in turn, felt by Australia to be less than totally helpful in resolving the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For whatever reason the letter, which the Prime Minister had hoped would resolve the matter, did not do so. It became clear that some expression of regret would be helpful in completing and rounding out the picture. Accordingly, the Prime Minister chose the opportunity of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program on the weekend to convey just exactly some such expression of regret. As a result of the content of the letter and the TV program, we have had a very clear statement of the Prime Minister's position from him, from his mouth and from his pen, on the public record&mdash;a statement which, in effect, says that there was no intention to offend and, if there was offence taken, then that was regretted. That has been combined with statements of expression of understanding of the significance of the relationship, of the warmth of the relationship and of our commitment to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the weekend, as the situation has further continued, and I have returned to the country and thrown off the fevers which made my life a bit miserable for the last few days, I have become fully involved in this situation over the last three days, with results that I have mentioned already in question time today. I do not propose to go into detail about the nature and extent of that diplomatic activity which is now occurring except to say that we are working very hard to try to resolve the situation. We believe the situation will be most helpfully resolved by a cooperative effort on the part of all Australians in this matter and with an absolute minimum of the kind of, with respect, vulgar and opportunistic point scoring that is inherent in the text of this motion, which we reject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think even the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) would acknowledge that, in the area of diplomacy, words are bullets. Those words were used by a relatively more distinguished predecessor of the minister's; nonetheless, they remain very valid. Therefore, it is all the more extraordinary that we should have had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 22 November not just showing his frustration and lack of self control by using that offensive term `recalcitrant' but saying that he could not care less whether Dr Mahathir attended the APEC meeting. Having considered the full consequences of his remarks, he then chose to go on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> and say that his remarks were merely part of the rough and tumble of international politics.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is extraordinary that again we have heard a very limp defence by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, who&mdash;for all his professed awareness of the significance of words&mdash;continues to misuse the word `fulsome', which means `flatteringly insincere'. I presume he does not intend those to be the words used to characterise the Prime Minister's choice of words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement put out by a spokesman for the Prime Minister could give offence because it should have been put out in the first person by the Prime Minister, not by some flunkey or lackey on his behalf, giving every impression that the Prime Minister would not condescend to speak on the public record about the matter. He did not release the terms of the letter. He just put forward a case of self-defence, saying the issue had been blown out of proportion. What message does that convey to the Malaysians? It says someone else is distorting the issue and the Malaysians are taking offence unnecessarily. It also says that the Australian media is to blame, the Malaysian media is to blame or the Malaysian authorities have got it wrong. I would not have thought that to be in any way helpful. </PARA>

Yet we have had no acknowledgment from the Prime Minister that that was the effect and no regret at his choice of words. Who can blame the Malaysians for saying, as Dr Mahathir did subsequently, that he could not regard or define the letter as being conciliatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had yet another confirmation that the government has been far too clever by half in this very delicate area. It received what was clearly intended to be a formal expression of displeasure. The Acting Secretary-General of the Department of Foreign Affairs rang the Australian High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur and made it very plain that the Malaysians were very unhappy about the remarks made by Mr Keating. A statement was put out by a spokesman but it did not in any shape or form acknowledge that the Malaysians had concerns. It tried to pretend they were unconcerned by saying the Malaysian government had made no official protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very clever and semantic, as has been pointed out today. But it is utterly disingenuous and misleading. If the Trade Practices Commission had jurisdiction, it would find this an open-and-shut case of someone trying to give the impression, by misleading and deceptive conduct, that the Malaysians had nothing to worry about and had not really complained in terms that ought to be taken seriously. But we have had confirmation today from the minister's mouth that they did take it seriously. It is only a semantic point to talk about official protests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the purpose of the exercise? Is it to make those opposite feel good; that on the Richter scale of diplomatic gaffes that is only about a six instead of a nine? Because it was not characterised by them as official; it was really a very strong and formal expression of displeasure. To go ahead and put out that statement inevitably would have the consequences it has had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even as late as today, Senator Cook&mdash;if ever there were a boy on a man's errand, it has to be the junior minister&mdash;is wandering around Malaysia saying there will be a change in the relationship between the countries but that Australia has done enough to try to heal the rift. I would have thought that everyone acknowledges&mdash;certainly the public opinion polls&mdash;that there is more that the Prime Minister can do. The Prime Minister should not say, like a schoolboy caught with his hand in the till, `I am sorry I got caught'. He should be saying, `I should not have used those words in the first place. Those words did not just have the effect of giving offence, but they were utterly inappropriate and should not have been used'. He should have acted much more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister thinks he can get away with this sort of conduct in the international arena just because he seems to be able to get away with it in the domestic arena where the press thinks he is very clever to use such terms as scumbag and all the other terms that have so endeared him to the electorate. He thinks he can go to Seattle, mix it with world leaders and use that sort of gutter talk. That betrays the Prime Minister's fundamental incapacity to exercise diplomatic skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore extraordinary that Senator Evans seems remarkably reluctant to put on the record any efforts that he has made to try to counsel the Prime Minister. One suspects that the real answer is that the Prime Minister does not want to know the views of Senator Evans. Senator Evans, in his quest to be the next Secretary-General of the United Nations, does not want to be tagged with the oafish behaviour of his parliamentary leader. Nonetheless, it is very surprising that, when the minister dealt with this issue last Monday, he said that we will do everything we reasonably can to keep the relationship warm and productive, but if a good relationship is to continue it must be wanted and worked for by both sides. He is again lecturing the Malaysians. He is saying, `It is not our fault. If you want to fix it up, you do it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then goes on to say that it would be helpful if the Malaysian side were to acknowledge the circumstances in which Mr Keating's original remarks were made. That is another attempt to avoid responsibility and to somehow suggest that not only is the Prime Minister not guilty but also, if we look at the context, we will see it in a fundamentally different light. We know that is not the case; it is not the way it has developed. It is not the approach the Malaysians have adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say, further, that Senator Evans discovered just a few days ago that the Malaysian translation of `recalcitrant' is extremely insulting raises the obvious question as to whether this was brought to his attention by his departmental advisers and diplomatic representatives in Malaysia. If it was and Senator Evans did not act on it, there is a case to be answered. If they were not even aware of it&mdash;even though there had been a recent spat in the Malaysian press&mdash;one wonders what they do with their time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that they did relay all this and the Prime Minister ignored that counsel and chose to tough it out. Senator Evans went on to say that the media and other key interest groups in Australia are much more likely to line up against a person or institution in question, assuming that if a criticism is made there must be some case to answer. The obvious implication of that assertion is that there is not a case to answer in this instance. All Senator Evans has done is compound the felony, making it clear that we will not take any further initiatives and that it is up to the Malaysians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is almost 2 1/2 weeks since this utterly undisciplined statement was made by the Prime Minister, yet events have indicated that the relationship is going from bad to worse. We can send as many Cooks and Rays as we want to Malaysia, but only one person can repair the damage; that is, the Prime Minister. But his ego stands in the way of any repair of the relationship. What we are stuck with is Senator Evans saying it is tough luck for Australian exporters. He said that if they are on the brink of losing hundreds of millions of dollars that is in the nature and hazards of business life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot expect people to factor in an avoidable and political risk of a Prime Minister running off at the mouth and fundamentally fracturing the relationship we have with one of our near neighbours. Only a few months ago, the Malaysian foreign minister was making it clear what a very good relationship we have. The deterioration since that time is the fault of one person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He can send his junior minister and his Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to Malaysia every day of the week, but everyone knows that there is only one person the Malaysians will take any notice of, and he is the person who not only cannot bring himself to acknowledge that his remarks gave offence but also shows not the slightest remorse or regret and has uttered no expression of conciliation. He seems to be perfectly content to see billions of dollars in contracts with Malaysia put at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom Australia is keen to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in the region. Malaysia plans to spend up to $10 billion through 1997 on telecommunications. This seems to be of no concern to the government which prefers to wriggle around and pretend it is everyone's fault except the Prime Minister's. We all know the facts of life. Even Senator Gareth Evans understands whose fault it really is. The sooner he starts to give some sensible and constructive advice&mdash;and better still, is listened to&mdash;the closer we might be to resolution. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . his failures to take appropriate action to prevent the increasing and continuing damage to Australia's relations with Malaysia, Australia's standing in Asia and Australia's significant trade with Malaysia arising from his intemperate remarks concerning the Malaysian Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very disappointing that a motion of this type has been moved because, essentially, it is so untimely, so unfortunate and so completely inappropriate. It is quite clear that such a proposition is ill-considered and, in my view, totally irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston said that words are bullets in diplomacy. Surely that is an adage that applies as much to the opposition as anybody else. The talk about an undisciplined response would surely also apply to the remarks of Senator Alston and the opposition in this whole issue. Senator Hill talked about the need to be sensitive to the development of a relationship with Malaysia. I would suggest that that is good advice for the opposition to follow as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government has tried to resolve these issues in a manner befitting the difficulties facing our relationship with Malaysia at the moment&mdash;that is, in a manner befitting the very serious interests that are at stake between this country and Malaysia, and in a manner that clearly points out that our intentions were, essentially, not to cause offence to Malaysian officials, the Malaysian government or the Malaysian people, but to understand how significant is that relationship between Malaysia and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can measure that significance in trade terms. We can point out, for instance, that currently the trade between the two nations stands at $2.4 billion. We can also point to the fact that the level of imports coming from Malaysia to Australia is very significant and growing&mdash;it grew some 17 per cent to $380 million in the last year. We can also indicate the very large level of exports from Australia to Malaysia, with Australia now being the 14th largest source of imports within the Asian region. It is also important to point out the assistance that Australia is giving Malaysia in education. As Senator Gareth Evans indicated today, the relationship goes far beyond mere trade matters; it goes to defence, to economic development, to a regional complexion, and also to a global complexion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the complexity of that relationship, one would think it would be appropriate for all members of this community, all aspects of government&mdash;I include the opposition when I talk about government apparatus in this country&mdash;to have some consideration for the national interest and not seek to use quite opportunistic, undisciplined, irresponsible and totally ill-considered actions to try to embarrass the government at a time like this in an attempt to score rather simple and cheap political points which only serve to exacerbate the dispute. If the intentions of those opposite were really sincere, they would be talking about ways and means by which this dispute could be resolved, not adding fuel to the fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also put those points about national responsibility to elements of the Australian media. There are times in any conflict when I believe that our national interest should be held above some of the more lurid aspects of our domestic political debate. There are times when it is the responsibility of certain sections of the Australian media to understand that their actions, in themselves, can inflame the situation. Just as it is the responsibility of all members of parliament to appreciate that their words are bullets, so it is the responsibility of journalists to understand that their words are bullets also.</PARA>

But there is no intention on the part of the Malays to treat this in a magnanimous way. We have to recognise those basic facts of life and we have to understand that, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> indicated quite clearly yesterday, perhaps now is the time for silence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this censure motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) moved by Senator Hill this afternoon. Malaysia is Australia's 11th most important trading partner. It is more important than many of the much bigger countries in the world about which we hear so much. It is a bigger trading partner for us than, for example, Germany, Italy, France, or even our close colleague and neighbour Canada. It is an even bigger trading partner than Thailand, which is one of the fastest growing countries in Asia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Malaysia is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Its average growth rate over the last five to 10 years has been between 10 and 11 per cent per year. As a result, some of our biggest companies&mdash;BHP, CRA, Amcor, Boral, Leightons and Transfield, just to name a few&mdash;have growing links with Malaysia. There are also many hundreds of medium and small companies about which we do not hear so much that are doing all they possibly can to build relations with Malaysia and the Asian region. We, and they, are so often lectured by the Prime Minister about the need to get closer to the region and build those relationships. They are sentiments with which we agree totally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have longstanding defence and security links with Malaysia and, through them, with the region as a whole. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, so rightly referred to this afternoon, there are very strong personal relationships between many Australians and Malaysians. When I went to the University of Melbourne in the 1950s I was fortunate enough to number Malaysian students amongst my closest friends, and I am sure many others can give similar examples. Anything that damages that very important relationship is therefore a matter of most serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have on our hands a situation where there has been a fundamental rupture in relations between Malaysia and Australia which should never have arisen, but has arisen for one simple reason: the loose mouth of an arrogant and irresponsible Australian Prime Minister who made his remarks in front of television cameras when he was basking in the glory of the Seattle summit meeting. There, in front of the television cameras, he publicly bad-mouthed the leader of one of our major regional partners. That has implications not only for our relations with Malaysia but also for our standing in the region as a whole and our relations with other individual neighbours and partners within that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do have a very big problem on our hands which has occurred for two reasons. I have mentioned the first. Both of these form the basis of the coalition's censure motion of the Prime Minister today. The first is the Prime Minister's intemperate, irresponsible and ill-judged series of remarks in Seattle when he not only offensively called Dr Mahathir a recalcitrant but also, at the same time, used other very dismissive language in referring to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason why we have this very serious problem today is that, having made that inexcusable mistake in the first place, the Prime Minister has then compounded the problem by his subsequent failure to take appropriate action to prevent&mdash;even to limit&mdash;the increasing and continuing damage to Australia's trade and other relations with Malaysia and the damage to our standing in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the rhetoric and pseudo-defence from Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Carr this afternoon in response to the coalition's censure motion, there is one fundamental point that cannot be overlooked: we have a problem that should never have arisen. Given that it arose because of the very ill-judged, intemperate remarks of Australia's Prime Minister, it could have been settled&mdash;very easily, we believe&mdash;by his taking early action to correct the wrong that he had done and the serious impression that he had left with Dr Mahathir. The fact that he did not do that is an enormous indictment of the Prime Minister and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this censure motion refers solely to the Prime Minister, Senator Evans is deserving of equally strong criticism for his apparent failure to act in relation to this dispute. He is, after all, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. More importantly, he is the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his basic responsibility is relations between Australia and other countries around the world, particularly those in our region. The failure of Senator Evans to do anything at all about this matter until today&mdash;that is what he said at question time&mdash;makes it apparent that he has achieved precious little. Even worse, he said at question time today that the Prime Minister could say nothing more to resolve the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Senator Evans appears to have either been mute or absolutely neutered in his role is a very serious matter in itself. It indicates a major rift between the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Senator Evans has been less than forthcoming in his defence of the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister's actions. I think that in itself sounds important warning bells about our ability to conduct our affairs in other parts of the world and our relations with other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given our ties within the region, the Prime Minister of this country should know, understand and operate within the accepted cultural parameters of our neighbours. We expect foreigners to respect our cultural beliefs and our attitudes to other countries; rightly, they expect us to reciprocate. The fact that Mr Keating did not follow this practice&mdash;apparently he did not really know what he was doing and the implications of it&mdash;is an indictment of him and his ability rather than another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media&mdash;as has Senator Evans in his attempts in this place in recent days to defend the indefensible&mdash;have made much of the fact that Dr Mahathir has not personally complained about the comments made about him. That is certainly the way the Prime Minister's office seemed to be briefing the press in recent days. Of course, that is very misleading. That is a nonsensical approach. Dr Mahathir could not say anything himself because&mdash;as honourable senators would know if they know anything about the culture of that region&mdash;it would be an admission that our Prime Minister had caused him to lose face. The fact that our Prime Minister does not know or understand that shows appalling insensitivity on his part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of those reasons, the coalition regards the censure motion as a very important, very serious motion. The Malaysian cabinet is due to meet in three days time&mdash;on 11 December&mdash;to consider this matter. It is absolutely imperative that the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Australian government take all necessary action before that meeting on 11 December to ensure that, at the very least, we will try to do all that we can to redeem a very serious situation. It should never have arisen in the first place, hence the censure motion today, which I hope this chamber will support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I acknowledge that we have high expectations about the behaviour of our Prime Minister as he travels and represents this country. We do not expect a lapse in cultural sensitivity. However, I make the point that we have been in this situation before. Back in 1991, Prime Minister Hawke conceded, through the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, that his remarks on the hanging of two Australians at that time had been `downright insulting'. Prime Minister Hawke accepted the blame for the rift in relations between Australia and Malaysia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are in the same situation in 1993. It raises a lot of questions. It raises questions about cultural sensitivities on both sides of the argument&mdash;for example, the fact that we are not to know the direct translation of the word `recalcitrant'. It raises the issue of the cost to both countries if the escalation of tension is sustained. There will be a loss of trade, a loss of investment, a loss of opportunity for technology transfer, and plain loss of goodwill, which takes a long time to build up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments made by Senator Evans in this debate so far have been quite helpful in pointing out some of the tensions and in alerting us, as much as he can, to some of the actions being taken behind the scenes&mdash;actions that we are not privy to. I agree with him that a cooperative effort is necessary, but I do not think we should spend all of this debate dwelling on who is most at fault. We should ask ourselves: in a cross-party constructive way, is there any way in which we can contribute to breaking the impasse, repairing the damage and sending the sorts of signals that are appropriate to the way in which we will conduct future relationships with Malaysia? This comes down to a couple of questions: to censure or not to censure, and what sort of signal will that send in this delicate stage of negotiations; to apologise or not to apologise, and what that will mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am proposing an amendment which I will now take the opportunity to move. The Australian Democrats, for reasons that have a great deal to do with the sensitivities of the moment, would prefer to scale down `censure' to `regret'. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Omit all words after "That the Senate", substitute "regrets that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has failed to take appropriate action to prevent the increasing and continuing damage to Australia's relations with Malaysia, Australia's standing in Asia and Australia's significant trade with Malaysia, arising from his intemperate remarks concerning the Malaysian Prime Minister".</PARA>
<PARA>The rest we can accept. I think the key point is that there has been a failure to act promptly in an appropriate way. We have seen the stand-off. We acknowledge there is blame on both sides. We also acknowledge the damage that that impasse can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have liked my amendment to have included an apology. It is possible for the Senate to say, `We can play a constructive role'. On behalf of the people of Australia, I am perfectly willing to apologise for the unintended offence given&mdash;because I think that it was unintended&mdash;but, for various reasons, that is unacceptable to both the government and the opposition. I simply make the point that we could have taken this opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: are we likely to revisit this situation? The Minister for Trade (Senator Cook) has visited Malaysia and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) is visiting at the moment. I am worried that focusing on the visits simply escalates the media attention. We should not exclude from comment in this debate the way in which the Malaysian Prime Minister, Dr Mahathir, singled out the Australian press, describing it as a naughty child who needed a spanking. In the circumstances, that was not a particularly helpful comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the opposition, by acknowledging the sensitivity of the ongoing behind-the-scenes negotiations between Malaysia and Australia and the need to break the impasse, will be willing to consider substituting the word `regret' for `censure'.

It brings to mind a firm in Queensland that both Senator Kernot and I know of, Voxson, which has had its Malaysian operation threatened. I referred to this matter yesterday.

He asked her, `Do you live in Malaysia or what? Do you have any idea of what goes on in Malaysia?', which reduced the lady to tears.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I received a phone call from Kowari Motors in Townsville, which has had detailed discussions with Malaysia over the last year on a major contract for 100 tow trucks at $41,000 each. That is $4.1 million. The company was in a very favourable position. It had a far superior specification but was told last week by its Malaysian agent that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Submissions from Australia would not be considered.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what is happening in the marketplace. This is what is happening to people who heeded the government's advice to go offshore and invest their money in Malaysia and in Asia, only to be sunk by the inappropriate remarks of the Prime Minister. Trade worth $2.4 billion is a lot of trade. It is hundreds of millions of dollars to the fruit industry, the sugar industry and the wool industry, which are all at risk because the Prime Minister has not got the ability to control his emotions. That is the problem: he has not got the ability to control his emotions. He has not got the mental discipline of a Prime Minister. For that reason, this censure motion should be carried&mdash;not because we are losing trade, though that is important, but because the Prime Minister cannot fill the high office to which he was elected with the degree of decorum that is required of a Prime Minister. If this is allowed to go on, he will offend someone else. He will offend another country. Therefore, I hope that Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats, and the Greens, will support this censure motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an absolutely enormous document which was not available until tabling. However, I think it is a very significant document. It is particularly significant because in this case one of the assistant commissioners to the Resource Assessment Commission, Commissioner Bob Graham, went to the extent of making a separate and dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It certainly seems to me that Bob Graham has gone a great deal further and into a great deal more detail than the other commissioners of the Resource Assessment Commission. This indeed is a very important matter. I think everybody in this chamber would recognise that the coastal management of Australia has been disastrous and that we have a large and increasing number of degraded areas around this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, in its main conclusions and in the dissenting report, identifies that a national perspective, a national strategy and a national approach are required. Therefore, this will clearly require an ongoing involvement of the federal government. It is not sufficient simply to leave coastal management to state and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues are common to the whole of Australia: problems of the development of frontal dunes, pollution of watercourses which flow down into estuarine and marine areas, stormwater disposal, inappropriate coastal developments, garbage disposal and the like, as well as the more serious and point impacts of mining for beach sands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report draws particular attention to the fact that the main report looks broadly at the issues. While the dissenting report agrees that the very broad issues are important and must be addressed, nonetheless a lot of the damage that is going on along our coastlines is being caused by a large number of incremental impacts. The main report does not deal adequately with that at all. We need to put appropriate strategies in place by which those incremental impacts will be adequately controlled. That means getting down to the detail of planning and what goes on at the local level, but it must be seen within the context of the big picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Graham, in one part of the report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I do not believe that the recommendations and proposals contained in the report of my fellow Commissioners provides a sufficient base to address the very real questions of managing the use and the development of Australia's coastal zone resources.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very important qualifier. Anybody reading this report needs to take that on board seriously. The main part of the report adequately deals with an address on the very serious problems on the coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry it became obvious that major differences had emerged over the approach to be taken in the report. As Bob Graham says, the report focuses on the big picture. However, it fails to recognise the seriousness and the urgency of the problems facing the coastal zone. Probably the most serious problem, as I have said, is the tyranny of small decisions&mdash;and they need to be picked up. Little by little, the integrity of the coastline is whittled away by incrementally small scale development which, over time, leads to major and then irreversible changes in the coastline ecosystem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need look no further than the eastern seaboard where now an almost seamless strip of residential sprawl has robbed us of a pristine and biologically diverse environment. If no action is taken to stem this spread of human settlement&mdash;the report itself points out that over 80 per cent of people live on the Australian coastline&mdash;then we will see the complete removal, outside of national parks, of a natural coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dissenting report reflects the critical situation that Australians face today to save our coastal zone. It presents an excellent account of management prescriptions for the area and notes that new and innovative approaches to planning need to be developed; policies need to be made to work, implemented and enforced; local communities need to be empowered so that they can participate in policy making and policy implementation; management practices need to be integrated across a number of areas; and a nationally based monitoring program should be established to evaluate the effectiveness of management and changes in resource use. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately I have not been able to read the 517 pages of the report of the Resource Assessment Commission on the coastal zone inquiry since obtaining it recently, nor the 87 pages of appendices, but I have had a look at some of the recommendations, particularly those concerning the economic and financial instruments to meet the objectives of the national coastal action program. I have also noted the commentary in the press on these recommendations and it was this commentary which raised my concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an AAP story today which indicated that, should this report into the coastal zone by the Resource Assessment Commission be adopted, it will require new pricing proposals for a levy on developers in all coastal areas to cover social, ecological and economic costs of their development, the imposition of an accommodation tax, and the imposition of a user-pays system for water charges on all users. As I say, I have looked at the recommendations as they appear in the report and the words used in the report are not quite as inflammatory as the language in the press comment. Nevertheless, the report does not quell my concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have very serious concerns about the prospect of a special new tax on coastal accommodation. This would be an absolute disaster for the tourism industry, particularly in my home state of Queensland with its coastal tourist attractions such as Cairns, Port Douglas, Mission Beach, Townsville, Mackay, the Whitsunday Islands and the Sunshine and Gold Coasts. These tourist operators are already coming to terms with increases in sales and fuel taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really concerns me is the prospect of a tax on the use of our beaches in Queensland. Can honourable senators just imagine, if this recommendation is adopted, a tax on using beaches in Queensland? It would hit the Australian way of life in a way that I would find very disturbing and quite unacceptable. Can honourable senators just imagine a beach tax and the images that that conjures up? Can they imagine beach tax collectors walking along the beach? Can they imagine barbed wire fences being put up to keep tax avoiders from the beach? Can they imagine gates to the beach? Can they imagine these sorts of things? Perhaps there would be a new industry for bathing costume makers. Bathing costumes would have to be made with little pockets so that money could be kept in them to pay the beach tax collector. I note the following comment in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . concessional charges or exemptions be applied to lower income groups to ensure that they continue to have access to such areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Does this mean that people wanting to use the beach will have to apply to the tax office for a beach tax discount or an exemption? What will a person have to show to prove that he or she is a lower income earner so that he or she can get a beach tax discount to use the beach? The thought of going through a means test at the gate of the local beach is a pretty distressing one, particularly to those of us who accept beaches as a fundamental part of family life in Australia. The whole concept of a beach tax is unegalitarian and un-Australian. If this government has its way, our children will not be allowed to sing Christmas carols. But under this proposal&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>I am delighted that Senator Richardson is present while I am speaking to the report of the Private Health Insurance Administration Council, because I commend the report to him. It will be of enormous advantage to him when he confronts cabinet with his recommendations. If Senator Richardson read this report, he would see that&mdash;to quote the Prime Minister (Mr Keating); Senator Richardson may quote it back to him&mdash;it has a beautiful set of figures in it which will bolster his debate with the Prime Minister and with cabinet itself. The report says that the decline in the proportion of the population covered by private insurance is a matter of ongoing concern to the industry. At 30 June 1993, 39.4 per cent of the population was covered at the basic table level compared to 41 per cent at 30 June 1992. That is a very telling statistic&mdash;one which I know Senator Richardson is aware of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has gone down even further. The projections are that the population covered by private insurance will decrease by at least one per cent per annum. But, contrary to Senator Richardson's arguments about the amalgamation of the health care funds, I see that financial trends from 1984 to 1993 show a flat level of management expenses, particularly over the last four years. So perhaps that might not be to his advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which is of interest, I think especially to Senator Ian Macdonald, is that there has been an increase in Queensland of approximately 22,000 members. That is quite interesting when one considers that overall the industry lost 52,000 members over the previous year, and in most other states the recorded membership decreased. The total membership was 77,000 but, with the increase in Queensland of 22,000 and Western Australia of 2,700, that figure is brought down to 52,000. The reason that has occurred is quite apparent. It is because of the failure of the public hospital system in Queensland to cope with the long waiting lists that are occurring there. People have no alternative but to go into private insurance. On page 16 the report mentions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Benefits continue to increase, particularly benefits paid to persons aged 65 and over and benefits paid to members who require hospitalisation for 35 days or more in a rolling year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Richardson knows, the people that are joining private health insurance are the people in the older age group, and they are taking more out of it. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reinsurance pool for the year totalled just over $1 billion, an increase of 13.3 per cent over the previous year.</PARA>
<PARA>When these figures are combined with the report from the Health Insurance Commission, which was tabled yesterday, we see another fascinating set of figures. They show that the average value of benefit processed per service has decreased by 0.3 per cent while, at the same time, the numbers of services processed has gone up by 8.3 per cent. In other words, because of the bulkbilling phenomenon, the number of services is increasing but the benefits have gone down. They have actually decreased per service by 0.3 per cent. They have progressively gone down&mdash;in 1989-90 by 10.2 per cent; in 1990-91 by 10.5 per cent; in 1991-92 by 1.1 per cent; and in 1992-93 by 0.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the benefits have been decreasing and Senator Richardson's great attempt to curb the cost of benefits just is not working&mdash;it is working all right, but doctors are seeing more patients because they are racing them through quicker, and the benefits are decreasing because he has decreased the amount of refund under the benefits table. What is more intriguing is that pathology has increased by 30.4 per cent. Senator Richardson's great plan of a few years ago has been blown out of the water. The figures for pathology were minus 14.5 per cent in 1989-90 and minus 2.5 per cent in 1991. Senator Richardson claims his plan was a great success, yet in 1991-92 pathology increased by 16.8 per cent and in 1992-93 it increased by 30.4 per cent&mdash;a blow-out from $30 million to $39 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Private Health Insurance Administration Council report to the Minister for Health. I am sure that there is a lot of great material in there. I commend to Senator Richardson particularly page 106 in the Health Insurance Commission report, as it will give him some added ammunition in his confrontation with the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make some comments about the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I have not had time to read the whole of the tribunal's report but I draw the attention of the Senate to page 7 of the document, where there are two very telling statements. The first one reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Appeals Tribunal was first set up by Ministerial directive on 10 February 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, it had only the power to make recommendations, which the Department was not bound to accept.</PARA>
<PARA>Then, further down the page, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1988 . . . the Government announced its intention to establish a new tribunal with powers of decision.</PARA>
<PARA>The report states that later on the tribunal was established, and it is now operating. As a member of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal back in the late 1970s, and as someone who is very disturbed about its operation in those days and who eventually was asked to resign from the tribunal, I must say that the operations of the tribunal today are far more significant, far more telling and far more satisfactory than when I was a member. On page 13, where there is an analysis of the tribunal's performance, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Tribunal changed the decision under review in 35.6 per cent of appeals finalised.</PARA>
<PARA>In my day, about two or three per cent of the appeals in Brisbane were allowed. In fact, it was almost impossible for an appellant to have his or her appeal upheld. I believe the figure of 35 per cent of appeals being finalised and upheld is about what it ought to be if such an appeals tribunal is to have any effect at all. So I commend the report to the Senate, and trust that honourable senators will read it. I also commend the Social Security Appeals Tribunal for the effectiveness of its work these days. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to see the annual report from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, an authority that does a lot of good work in relation to the barrier reef and an authority that is principally based in the area of Queensland from which I come. In the short time available to me, I wish to mention a couple of the matters mentioned in the report. The first one is the environmental management charge, which I refer to as the reef tax. There have been some difficulties with the implementation of the tax since it was introduced earlier this year. The amount set by the government by way of regulation is said in the report to translate to about $1 per passenger per day. As I understand it, it is really about $1 per passenger per day per operator. If a person is using more than one operator on the reef, or if that person goes out on a catamaran and then a different operator operates the barge, the pontoon to which the person is going or the kayaks, that person pays an extra fee and it becomes a very complicated fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a bit disappointed that the government went ahead with this fee. It is yet another tax on tourism. The government seems to think that tourism is a milch cow to be flogged at any time it is short of money. Admittedly, the money raised goes towards research on the barrier reef, but one has to raise the question of whether this should not come from the general revenue, bearing in mind the enormous contribution that tourism already makes to the general revenue. I have received some answers from the department to questions I raised at the estimates committee about the complaints and difficulties experienced by operators in facilitating this tax. There are quite a number of them, which I will make further comment on at some other time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see the report mention the very important issue of oil spill prevention, and I am pleased to see that there is a review under way to see whether ships should come inside or outside the barrier reef. It will be very interesting to see what conclusion that report comes to. I am pleased, as I of course would have expected, that the authority is very involved in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted in my brief look through the report a section dealing with tourism research and traditional hunting permits. A matter of some concern is that a tourist operator in the Cairns region has been prevented from proceeding with a tourism activity around&mdash;not on&mdash;Fitzroy Island off Cairns, one of the islands that has been claimed by Aboriginals pursuant to Mabo. Due to a mix-up between the two operators, a permit was not obtained a few months ago when the venture was originally put into operation. When they found this out they applied to the Queensland government for a permit and the Queensland government said to them, `We will be issuing no more permits in relation to any tourist facility, island, beach or foreshore on which any Aboriginal claim has been made because we don't want to get ourselves into a situation where we may have to pay big compensation for the extinguishment of native title'. This means that a viable tourist activity in the Cairns region can now not proceed, despite permits from various government departments, because of these Aboriginal claims. That is of concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, because I have only five minutes, I want to briefly mention the Magnetic Keys review. The authority issued permits for the development of Magnetic Keys. It was opposed by some radical and fairly irresponsible Greens and conservation people. They kicked up such a stink that the government spent a lot of money to put in a review to see whether the authority had properly conducted itself. The review showed that the authority had done the right thing. It is pleasing to see that reported on in the report and that the independent review that was conducted at some considerable expense came to the conclusion that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority acted properly in giving permits for Magnetic Keys. </PARA>

<PARA>Again, I really have not had much opportunity in the half hour available to me to do more than skim through the annual report of the Australian Institute of Marine Science, but I am aware of the very good work that the institute does. I had the pleasure recently to visit the institute at Cape Ferguson, just south of Townsville, and to inspect the work that the director and the staff are doing. It is good to refresh one's memory every now and again on the magnificent work that the institute does, not only in the North Queensland area and in relation to the Great Barrier Reef but also in all parts of Australia where marine science is important and an issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the institute has done a lot of work on the West Australian coastline and I think it has done work in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island. I was talking to the institute about where its expertise could be used to assist the people of Christmas Island in a wave problem that they have which makes it difficult for them to get goods in and out of Christmas Island at the high swell periods of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The institute has a magnificent facility at Cape Ferguson. The institute was set up during the term of the previous Liberal governments. It is something that the Liberal Party is very proud of. It was instituted while Mr Duke Bonnett and Mr Gordon Dean represented the federal seat of Herbert. It was a great initiative at the time. Those of us who live in North Queensland are very proud of the institute. We always get a little edgy when there are suggestions from Senator Schacht and his ilk that they might take the institute down and put it in some other place in Australia where the Labor Party needs to buy some votes at any particular time. We are always, as I say, just a little sensitive that it stay in North Queensland, where it is most appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had some discussions with the director and with the staff on Senator Schacht's proposal to rearrange marine science in Australia and to have it incorporated in the CSIRO. I will not divulge any confidences by saying what my discussions were with those people, although I will say that there were some parts of Senator Schacht's proposals which the current people at the institute have looked at with some interest. There is a thought with marine scientists that perhaps there should be a bigger unit that looks after all aspects of marine science and that it should not be fragmented. We will be pursuing that in the future when Senator Schacht is game enough, if he ever is, to bring whatever proposals he ends up with before this parliament. But I personally did take advantage of looking at the institute and discussing matters with the staff. I commend again the institute for the good work it does and for its annual report. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to refer back to the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993 and amendments circulated in respect of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely disgraceful what the government has done in relation to this Industrial Relations Reform Bill. Mr President, in an effort to expedite handling of this particular piece of legislation, you will remember that we had it referred to the Senate committee early&mdash;in fact, before it had reached this place. We thought that that would enable greater time for the committee to do its job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we failed to appreciate was that the government was going to move over 200 amendments to its own piece of legislation, including the introduction of a totally new part. So the work of the committee has been thwarted. The committee did a good job, I might say, under impossible time constraints and brought down a report, particularly a dissenting report, that was very informative. That was useful for the Senate in its debate. Presumably, senators on all sides of this chamber would like to see a well-informed debate. But that process has now been totally defeated by this current abuse&mdash;that is, since consideration by the committee, the government has moved what must be a unique number of over 200 amendments to its own piece of legislation. We are not talking about all the amendments of the Democrats, or some of our amendments, or those of the Greens; this is the government amending its own piece of legislation even before it goes through the final legislative process. What a shambles. What an unprecedented shambles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have known occasions when government members have sought to amend their own bills before they have been debated in this place, but never have I come across a situation where they have sought to move 200 amendments to their own bill. It is an embarrassment. They should be humiliated by this. It is a total abuse of process that they now expect this Senate to debate a bill with over 200 amendments when the committee was not given the opportunity to consider even one of those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the worst part of it is that they have the nerve at 11 o'clock today&mdash;and bear in mind that they wanted this debated last night&mdash;to bring in an amendment which introduces a totally new part to the bill headed `Paid Rates Awards'. There are pages and pages that list the objects of it. There is the heading, `Paid rates functions and powers' that sets out all the rates and powers. There is the heading, `Certain disputes to be referred to Bargaining Division'. There is the heading, `Certain disputes to be referred back to relevant Presidential Member'. There is a new division 3 entitled, `Making, varying and cancelling paid rates awards'. It has a heading, `Commission to consider whether paid rates disputes should be settled by an agreement under Part VIB'. Nobody had seen any of this until today. There is the heading, `Making or varying paid rates awards'. I go over page after page. Other headings are `Commission to maintain existing paid rates awards', `Party acting inconsistently with award's status as a paid rates award' and  `Paid rates awards to be identified as such'. One could go on. This is a total abuse of process. As this debate is about to start in this chamber, government members bring down such a substantial change to their own legislation. They ought to be embarrassed by that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Harradine are not going to tolerate this process. They know that this chamber is a house of review. They know that it has a responsibility to do its job properly. They know that it is not going to be abused by this sort of cheap shot. They want this chamber to be able to consider legislation after due thought and due consideration. I say confidently that they will join with us and send this back to the committee in order that it might be properly dealt with and the Senate can then conduct a properly informed debate. Therefore, I have moved for the suspension of standing orders in order that I might move that substantive motion in the hope that the legislation can go back to the committee, the committee can do its job and then we can have a proper debate on the legislation in this place. </PARA>

But there is no doubt that these 177 amendments have been known of for a long time because they were dealt with by the House, so that is at least two weeks ago. When did the House finish sitting? The House did not sit last week. So let us get it clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at what happens when a new bill is introduced. People get a week's notice to deal with it. So why is it that the Senate cannot consider amendments with two weeks notice? I realise that some may only be half as smart as some people in the House of Representatives, but it is unreasonable to propose that giving the Senate two weeks notice of amendments is not reasonable if giving everybody a week's notice is reasonable. That is the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether any new issue of principle is involved. Effectively, this matter has been debated since 1987&mdash;certainly since the election, and in detail since April. There have been some nuances of variation since the last election, but the issues have been substantially the same for at least six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who says that this bill has to go back to another committee is doing nothing other than deliberately seeking a way of defeating a bill which they do not have the numbers to defeat. It is another attempt to re-run the election. The opposition ran this in the election campaign and, sensibly and intelligently, the Australian people rejected that position. Since we have had a division on the second reading, the opposition knows the legislation has majority support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That support does not extend to every dot and comma that the government wants. Undoubtedly, during the committee stage some amendments will be carried which we would prefer not to be carried. But 40 senators are ready to proceed&mdash;40 senators have had a fortnight to look at the amendments and they know what they are about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Hill's motion and to set a few things right on the record. When the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training met, it did not have these amendments. If my recollection of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is correct, the committee was told that approximately 100 more amendments were to come&mdash;and we have officers sitting at the table who were present at those hearings of the committee. While I do not have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of that hearing before me, that is my recollection of what the committee was told.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate now has to consider whether it will properly scrutinise legislation of this magnitude&mdash;legislation which has been changed month by month, day by day and minute by minute. As Senator Hill said, the opposition was handed more amendments at 11 o'clock this morning. Yesterday we were also given additional government amendments. These amendments have been a moveable feast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Reform Bill is quite different now to what it was when it was dealt with by the committee. The opposition did the right thing in moving for an early hearing of the bill by the committee, and those amendments should have been put before the committee. I cannot believe that the government has been as incompetent as it has been with this legislation. The government has brought forward not a small amendment that will effect marginal change but a whole new series of amendments that affect an entire section of the Industrial Relations Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where have these amendments been? Did the ACTU telephone government members at 5.30 this morning and say, `You had better change it again. We want this bit in.'? What has been going on? I ask Senator Harradine, Senator Bell and Senator Margetts whether they believe that major legislation should be properly scrutinised and analysed. This is a major test of whether they believe that the Senate should work in the way it is intended to. They have to look in their little mirror and say whether they will allow the government to push through these various amendments and changes or whether they will allow the work of the committee to become superfluous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to those honourable senators to carefully watch what they are doing because their actions now will have long-term ramifications on how legislation is handled in this place. That is what this debate is about. It also challenges the seriousness of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee took evidence from a significant number of witnesses and dealt with 27 submissions put forward on the legislation as it stood at that time. These amendments were not part of that consideration. Does the government intend misleading all those people who invested their time, resources and effort in coming to Canberra? Will the government mislead those people through this final product? That is the important question the government has to ask itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is demeaning the work of the committee. If that committee is expected to analyse the various bills that come before it, the government has to ask whether it will mislead those people who gave evidence. Undoubtedly, had the committee had all these amendments before it when it considered its report, that report would have been quite different. Senator Murphy is shaking his head. He would not have changed his mind because his opinions on this matter are set in concrete. So we do not have to worry about his changing his mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat my appeal to Senator Bell, Senator Harradine and Senator Margetts to ensure that bills continue to be properly scrutinised and analysed in this place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the committee had had these amendments before it, it would not have reported back to this chamber in any different way than it already has. Senator Crane accused me of having my opinions set in concrete, but his dissenting report would be no different from what it was. It would be a waste of time to refer this bill back to the committee. The opposition argues that, if the bill were referred back to the committee, all of us would be better informed and the bill would supposedly not need amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not been here very long, but I know that nearly all the bills I have seen come into this chamber have been amended in some form or other. Those amendments can happen right up to the time that the bill is finally passed. What about the amendments, proposed by Senator Crane, by the Australian Democrats and by the Greens, that we have not seen and that the committee did not have? Was there any attempt to refer those back to the committee? No, because we would debate those amendments in this chamber. That is what we would do and that is what we should do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the government's amendments, whether there are 100 or 177 does not really matter because in the main those amendments are about general matters such as correcting the bill in terms of its technicalities. Indeed, the one that Senator Hill refers to as a new amendment&mdash;a brand new amendment&mdash;is nothing but an addition to what is already in the bill. If those opposite understood industrial relations and understood what the bill is about then they would know that. </PARA>

The essence of these faxes was a complaint that there had not been sufficient media coverage of the matters being covered by the bill. I contacted several of the people who sent me these faxes because I believe that they deserve to be considered seriously. I rang about 10 today, and about 15 yesterday, and my staff also contacted another couple of dozen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked one person, who had contacted me complaining about a lack of media coverage, whether he would be interested in receiving the 50 pages of media coverage which were actually kept only because they mentioned the Australian Democrats&mdash;one does that. He did not seem to be particularly interested in receiving the 50 pages. I suggested that if he had looked at any couple of weeks during the past 18 months he would have been able to compile a similar dossier. But he really was not interested in that. He wanted to know why it had not been in his local paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read him a list of where it had been expounded, but still there was no acceptance of the need for his local member to contact him. I, in fact, asked this person whether his local member had taken the trouble during the past 18 months to contact him to find out his views on the matter of the industrial relations reform&mdash;whether he was concerned about any particular matter or not&mdash;and I got another no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then said, `What about your local chamber of commerce? Has it consulted with you about this matter?' Again the answer was no. I said, `Why is it then that over the past year we have received at the Senate committee of inquiry into two related matters&mdash;sections 45D and 45E and the Industrial Relations Reform Bill&mdash;representations on your behalf by industry representative groups, employer representative groups and in fact members of parliament? Would you be interested to hear what they had to say on your behalf?' The person I was speaking to was absolutely astounded that he had been represented but not advised in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here is a lack of capacity to properly represent people. How dare anybody come to this place&mdash;take the trip to Canberra, as described by Senator Crane&mdash;sit in a committee, represent somebody and then claim that that person has not had the opportunity to be heard. That is the function of a Senate committee of inquiry&mdash;to hear those who represent others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry came to this place representing so many thousands of small businesses. We heard the Business Council of Australia and the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia telling us how many thousands of small businesses they represented, yet we have got a couple of hundred faxes here from those businesses claiming that they know nothing of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would accuse those representative bodies of a total lack of representativeness if they have not informed those whom they claim to represent of the nature of this legislation. The nature of this legislation, as has already been said, has been discussed, I think, ad nauseam. That is one reason why I initiated the Senate committee of inquiry into sections 45D and 45E&mdash;to get this matter aired in public, to provide a public opportunity for discussion of the substantive issues. They have been discussed. The matters before us have not changed in substance.

One of the very reasons why we are opposing this legislation&mdash;so much of the evidence that was presented at the original committee hearing related to this aspect&mdash;is that the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to the Institute of Directors on 21 April bears absolutely no relationship to this legislation.

The minister has admitted that we did not get those amendments until after the hearings commenced. Yet those hearings were undertaken on the basis of submissions that were put to the committee before that first hearing on 11 November.

The fact is that those opposition amendments arise out of our committee hearings. They arise because of the very evidence that we heard in the committee. Therefore, it is quite legitimate for those amendments to come forward. The government's amendments have nothing to do with what was heard in any evidence to the committee and so they ought to go back to the committee for further hearing and further consideration. There is enormous concern in the community about the impact of this legislation and the amendments which have not had adequate consideration by the Senate and by the members who have taken a particular interest in the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan also said it was irrelevant to refer this matter back to the committee because we have dealt with a number of bills in this chamber&mdash;even today, he said&mdash;that have had amendments put to them and they have still been considered by the Senate. The fact is those bills were never referred to committees. This bill, because of its importance and its complexity, was referred to a committee for consideration. We have had subsequent amendments brought in, as we say, more than 200 of them and, as late as this morning, a completely new section which that committee, which was supposed to give detailed consideration to the effect of this bill, has simply not had a chance to consider. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with these amendments, there are a number of things I would briefly like to bring to the attention of the committee. I will not revisit the previous debate, but I think I should highlight the importance of looking at the complexity of the changing material that has been put before us over the last two or three weeks regarding this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To follow it through, we actually have to deal with some 10 separate pieces of legislation&mdash;that is, the Industrial Relations Act 1988; the Remuneration and Allowance Legislation Amendment Bill 1992; the Superannuation Guarantee (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992; the Superannuation Legislation (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Act 1992; the Industrial Relations (Legislative Amendment) Act 1992; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill 1992; the Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992; the Qantas Sale Act 1992; the Coal Industry Legislation Amendment Bill and the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we are to deal with the Industrial Relations Reform Bill of 1993. As has already been stated here, since this legislation was introduced into the House of Representatives we have seen 177 amendments there and an additional 23 amendments in here from the government. That is the latest count, and I presume it is the end&mdash;I presume so, but I would not bet on it. Of course, there are another 50 amendments from the Greens, the Democrats and ourselves regarding this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say that this is an absolutely ridiculous situation. We can go back through all this legislation, yet matters dealing with industrial relations have not yet been consolidated into a single document with which we can logically and sensibly follow this through. It begs the question: what hope has the public got of following what this government is trying to do? The answer to that is: absolutely and totally none. It is a most unsatisfactory position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know who we are supposed to blame in this exercise. Is it incompetence by the government? Is it lack of resources in the department or is it incompetence in the department? Why is the Senate put in a position whereby it cannot get these various bits and pieces consolidated into one act?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, we now have a significant increase in the reliance placed on international conventions. We have a totally confusing picture. Linking it back to these other acts will create more confusion in the mind of the public. I have no doubt that, when we have worked through these amendments and completed the task before us, when it goes out into the public arena the constituency out there will be very confused and not know where it stands on a whole host of matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important, in fact it is crucial, that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and also the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) take the necessary steps, immediately this legislation is completed, to get these matters consolidated into an act that is available not only for our consumption and for our use but available for the consumption and use of the very people it affects. Of course, it affects businesses out in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that I have heard what I might call some unfortunate comments in this place today with regard to some of the letters that have been received. I have now received over 500 letters from very concerned people. I certainly believe that the people who have sent those letters to me have done so because they are very concerned about what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin, there are people in the work force who also have a right to be able to get hold of a consolidated piece of legislation, or their organisations have, so that they know exactly where they stand as far as the industrial relations law is concerned and no situation is created whereby individuals find themselves breaking the law through no fault of their own. I make this statement at the beginning of this debate in the hope that the government will address this particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I make is that, in dealing with these amendments either en bloc or clause by clause, at the end of the day opposition members will be opposing this legislation because we do not believe that it will deliver what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) promised back in April of this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Bell's understanding of the rules of this chamber are about the same as his understanding of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. I am making some preliminary comments on the amendments that we will deal with in committee. I also indicate my concern about the number of amendments that have come in&mdash;and come in so recently. This is, as I think all honourable senators acknowledge, one of the most important pieces of legislation that this chamber has had to deal with in my term. This legislation is important in that the wealth and health of our nation are at stake. We all know&mdash;I think it has been acknowledged&mdash;that small business is the backbone of this country in the same way as it has been the backbone of England in the past. Without small business, we do not have wealth and we do not have employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will severely attack small business. That is the reason, as Senator Crane has mentioned and as others have mentioned in the second reading debate, there has been an enormous, perhaps belated, ground swell of concern about this legislation. A lot of submissions have been made to us about various aspects of the bill. People are seeking amendments to be made. All the amendments that have come through have made it practically impossible to deal with this bill. It is fairly clear that some of the minor parties, such as the Australian Democrats&mdash;even ourselves and certainly the government&mdash;still cannot grasp what amendments should be moved where and how this is going to be dealt with. We are going to make mistakes. I have no hesitation in making that prediction. The government makes mistakes on even the most simple of its legislation. But this is a bill of such importance that very careful and considered opinion is required on the whole myriad of amendments that are coming up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the Democrats. They were formed to make sure that legislation was properly addressed, that these sorts of mistakes did not happen, that everyone had the chance to have their say and that, where there was concern about a bill, at least it would be put off and looked at properly. Their founder formed the party on that basis. I know he is so concerned at the way the people who carry the name of the party he formed are dealing with this piece of legislation. It requires the utmost consideration. I fear that we will not be able to do that because of time constraints, the absolute mismanagement of this bill and the way it is to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) whether he would indicate to the committee the clauses relating to the heads of power utilised by the government for the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. I think it would be useful to the committee to identify the clauses for which certain specific heads of power are used for their validity. I know that might be a strange request, but I think it is relevant, having regard to clauses 1 to 3 of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may have noted that I have not entered this debate thus far. I have done that quite deliberately. I am somewhat concerned about the implications of the use which is being made of certain heads of power for the validity of certain clauses of this bill. Of course, it is not that I am not interested in this subject. I have been involved for almost 40 years in the industrial relations arena. As honourable senators know, next year is the 90th anniversary of the first arbitration act, which relied for its validity on the conciliation and arbitration power in the constitution. I understand the pressures that are being applied to the government to make an amendment to the Industrial Relations Act to allow greater flexibility. I am also conscious, however, of the fact that we have very high unemployment and that, whereas the bargaining boot was on the foot of employees some 20 years ago, it is now on the foot of the employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall very well opposing strenuously those of the extreme left who, some 30 years ago, rallied to the call of `Smash the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; destroy it'. They sought to do that because they believed in the survival of the fittest. That is not a philosophy that I subscribed to then and I do not subscribe to that philosophy now. There were innumerable battles within the trade union movement over that particular aspect. I am somewhat concerned&mdash;although I realise we have passed on&mdash;that in this bill the government is relying more extensively than heretofore on heads of power other than the conciliation and arbitration head of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a double-edged sword, of course. It is the extent to which these powers&mdash;I will not call them precedents because I suppose the corporations power and the external affairs power have been used in other circumstances&mdash;are being used, the validity of this measure, that concerns me. I am fully aware of the need for flexibility and modernisation, as it were, of the processes of industrial relations. But the rights of all concerned&mdash;both the employer and the employee&mdash;must be upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The founders of our constitution, the drafters and the approvers, were also very well aware of that. Those principles have not changed. The need for protection of the interests of the participants in the industrial relations system has not changed. In order to have industrial progress, the parties to any system must desire to see that system work. I am a little afraid that we may be going along a path which might see that desire dwindle and we might end up with greater problems than the ones we are trying to solve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in rising at this stage is to ask the minister whether he can identify now, or at some stage, those heads of power that have been used for the validity of this bill. Specifically&mdash;if it is not too much trouble&mdash;could he identify the clauses and the heads of power that are utilised to establish the validity of each of those clauses?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments are fully in line with those of my colleague Senator Harradine. Therefore, it is probably best if they are tackled together. I think Senator Harradine has pointed to a very important feature of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. The issue arises as to how the government acquires these very extensive powers to intrude into areas which have traditionally been the preserve of the states. There will be a philosophical difference between people in this chamber&mdash;I do not know whether that is a good thing or a bad thing. Nonetheless, the constitution, as it has operated in this country, has served to restrict federal powers in this area and preserve certain rights for the states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not purport to answer the questions that Senator Harradine has raised, but my understanding is that this bill relies on at least six ILO conventions, which will provide, in effect, heads of power for quite a number of these clauses&mdash;including some of the more controversial ones. I think Senator Harradine is right to point out to this chamber that, in heading down this road, the government is setting up a whole host of dangerous precedents; precedents which may ultimately come back to haunt those who are so blatantly&mdash;and, I believe, so wilfully&mdash;using international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will perhaps refine this issue a little, because I think there is a very interesting example in one area of this bill regarding the termination of employment. It is my understanding that this relies very substantially on ILO convention No. 158, which was ratified by the government during the election period. My first question is with respect to that section of the bill that relates to termination of employment. Am I right in assuming that it relies very heavily on ILO convention 158? Secondly, am I right in assuming that this was in fact ratified during the caretaker period of government, which is not a time for governments to make very serious decisions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is my understanding that ILO conventions typically go through a number of processes, such as consultation with states, consultation with various officers in departments around the states and consultation with employers and unions. I want to make this point very clear because I suspect there will be High Court challenges relating to what I believe is the wilful attempt to use the external affairs power. Was there any consultation with the states? If so, what was the nature of that consultation? Did the states agree with the ratification of the ILO convention?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding&mdash;I would like this to be confirmed&mdash;that an ILO convention is not ratified until we ensure that a nation's laws reflect that convention. In other words, the convention comes after the changes have been made rather than preceding the changes. I would like Senator McMullan's comments on that because my understanding is that in no way, given the wording of the convention, do Australia's laws currently come within the ambit of ILO convention 158. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, am I right in saying that only three industrial nations&mdash;France, Sweden and Spain&mdash;have ratified this convention; the other countries which have ratified it being essentially African countries, the lesser developed countries? I put this question very seriously to Senator McMullan because I believe this is one of the clauses which will cause enormous trouble for industry. None of our major competitors have ratified this clause, particularly those in the region of the world with which we now find ourselves trading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contributions to the debate on this clause fall into three groups. There were those that were, in effect, expanded speeches on the second reading. I am not being critical; that is standard when speaking to early clauses of a bill. I do not intend to respond to them, but that is a legitimate part of the process. There were questions from Senator Harradine. While they are not specifically about this clause, they could not have been asked at any other time; so I will endeavour to respond to them. Then there are those questions by Senator Kemp which actually belong in the committee stage debate on subsequent clauses. I will happily deal with those questions when we come to debate those clauses, but I will not take up the time of the committee by answering them now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Senator Harradine's questions, to make sure that I answer them in the detail that he wants, I will come back tomorrow morning with answers clause by clause. I do not think I am about to tell him anything he does not already know, given his knowledge of, and experience in, this area over a long period. But I put on the record&mdash;because he has asked the questions&mdash;that the three heads of power relate to conciliation and arbitration, corporations and foreign affairs. To some extent, those heads of power&mdash;at least, obviously the conciliation and arbitration power&mdash;underpin, and have underpinned since Federation, the Commonwealth industrial relations legislation. The corporations head of power has dealt with the secondary boycott provisions until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the new elements that are dealt with under the heads of power other than conciliation in the broad&mdash;this does not go to Senator Harradine's request about clauses, which I will provide to him tomorrow morning just to make sure that I have had the chance to double check&mdash;the corporations power underpins those sections of the legislation that relate to enterprise flexibility. The foreign affairs power underpins those sections relating to minimum entitlements and the sanction free bargaining period. That is the factual response in general, but I will get a detailed response to Senator Harradine tomorrow morning. </PARA>

These amendments also seek to insert sexual preference, age, physical or mental disability as grounds on which dismissal is prohibited. These provisions will also be reflected in enterprise agreements which will be concluded. I will quote from a magnificent and detailed opinion that I have received from Anthony Morris QC, who has advised on the constitutional validity of these provisions. After discussing why people with a particular sexual preference should not be discriminated against and why in past years they have been discriminated against, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, one returns ultimately to the most compelling question whether there is any justification to discriminate against a particular group of people in society simply because their behaviour is different from that of the majority, in so far as they have a predisposed sexual attraction to persons of the same sex. Our society has matured to the extent that other forms of discrimination, sexual, racial or ethnic, religious and so on are widely regarded as unacceptable and are prohibited by law. No thinking person can seriously argue that discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference is any less odious than any other form of arbitrary discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other points, age and physical or mental disability, I went into some detail in the second reading debate, citing numerous cases in employment of complaints being lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, on a state by state basis, about discrimination in employment suffered by people purely on the grounds of age or a particular disability. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the Civil Aviation Authority board made an announcement that the decision on the selection of the preferred tenderer for the TAAATS contract had been deferred. This contract goes back quite a few years, and I am not proposing to involve the Senate in a detailed explanation of the history of the contract at this time. Anyone interested in that can look in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> at some of my previous speeches, particularly those I gave through last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this contract provides for a new air traffic control system on a national basis at a projected cost of around $270 million to $300 million. The tenders were evaluated last year after the tender list was refined. The administrative selection process was so badly conducted that it led to a public outcry which, in turn, led to an inquiry. In essence, it recommended that the Civil Aviation Authority start again. It did this in March this year with a new evaluation team. It was announced quite some while ago that at 3.30 p.m. on Monday, 6 December the decision would be announced as to who the preferred tenderer would be, together with the tender price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can recall last week seeing in one of the papers notification to the effect that the announcement would be made on Monday. Monday came, but no announcement was made. Tuesday came, and it was at the end of yesterday that an announcement was made that the decision had been deferred to 23 December this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lack any personal knowledge as to what is going on in the tender evaluation process. I did have a very active interest in the contract evaluation last year. I took a leading part in the debate in the Senate about the way that that decision was being arrived at. But from the time that the inquiry into the TAAATS affair made its report, I have had no contact at all with anyone associated in any way with the tender evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not had any contact at all with any member of the Civil Aviation Authority who has been involved in the evaluation cell within the authority for the TAAATS contract. I have had no discussion at all with anyone in the Civil Aviation Authority about TAAATS, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Roser. He raised the matter with me when he was acting chief executive officer in the early part of this year. He told me that Mr Hider had been appointed as the chief of the division doing the tender evaluation, and there was no further discussion of the matter beyond the fact that Mr Hider had been appointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had no contact with Thomson-CSF, one of the two tenderers, in any form. I have had no contact with Hughes in any form whatsoever. I am not aware that I have had contact in any way at all with anyone associated with the contract. But, as someone who is interested in aviation, I put on the public record that I have heard from diverse sources throughout this year that there have been no complaints at all from any of the parties involved in the contract evaluation. Finally, I am not now entering into&mdash;nor will I in any way at all enter into&mdash;any debate about the selection process until the preferred tenderer is named. I reserve my right to make any comment, if I so choose, after that selection has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But tonight I want to voice in a responsible manner my concern at the fact that the decision was not taken at the promulgated date of Monday, 6 December. I can only go on what is on the public record. I would think it is a matter of grave concern for the two tenderers that the decision was not taken at that time. I think it is also a matter of regret that the board could not come to a decision at that time. There is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of today which is in accord with other articles which have appeared in a variety of newspapers. It quotes the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Doug Roser, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Following extensive discussions involving the independent auditor and formal briefings by staff of the TAAATS project office, the board has asked for more detailed information about the CAA's internal plans for the management of the project prior to making a final decision on the contractor."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say: "Basically the board has said we now know what the two contenders are offering, but what it needs to understand more about is how the CAA management team will manage the internal processes to ensure we get it right."</PARA>
<PARA>This evaluation started in March. It is the second time around for the evaluation, so I presume the evaluation team was a bit more efficient. The preferred tenderer must have been known to the board some while ago. It is quite inconceivable that when the board members met on Monday they would have been presented with papers which required them to make a decision on the spot; that would hardly have been good management practice. If the board knew some months back, it is difficult to see why it did not look at how the contract should have been, or could have been, implemented within its own division. Board members must have thought that through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final concern I have about the deferment is that selecting the date of 23 December&mdash;which is the Thursday before Christmas&mdash;means it is a time when any public comment on the decision will be difficult or quite impossible. I accept in good faith that the board has acted in a proper way. But I do think it has placed itself in a very unfortunate position. Having declared quite a long while ago that the decision would be made at 3.30 p.m. on Monday, 6 December, it is unfortunate that it could not organise its affairs in such a way as to make that decision public. It is a very important decision not only for the aviation industry of Australia but for the whole of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put on the record something that was denied to me at lunchtime: I wished to move to take note of an answer that was given by Senator Schacht on behalf of Mrs Kelly's office regarding a question I asked on Monday about concerns I had over the handing out of moneys associated with the one billion trees and save the bush programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted that the written answer I received from Mrs Kelly's office said that 64 per cent of the grants were given to areas where the coalition had seats. It sounded, not only from that but also from other press statements that have been made, that she had the feeling that perhaps I was accusing her of bias&mdash;like the sort of bias that was involved in the sports grants. I had no intention of doing that. My major concern was that instructions from her office that were given to Labor Party electorates in Tasmania and also to the conservation office, which was handling the money in Tasmania, said that the cheques would be handed out by the Labor Party politicians to gain the maximum amount of political advantage. I suppose one would expect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the net effect was, because two cheques were sitting in the office of the honourable member for Bass, Silvia Smith, and had been there for quite some time&mdash;and I believe five or six cheques have yet to be distributed by the honourable member for Lyons, Dick Adams&mdash;that the money going to these land care schemes was being delayed. In the case of the East Tamar scheme, I know that one of the people involved paid moneys out of his own pocket. With these land care schemes, particularly the ones where they are sowing trees by direct seeding or planting young seedlings, it is important that the work is carried out as quickly as possible before summer. I know, from discussions I had with some officers in Western Australia, that because of delays over there&mdash;I am not saying that they are political delays, but delays through bureaucrats and one thing or another&mdash;a lot of the projects have been delayed by 16 months. I do not think that is the aim of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The landcare scheme is probably one of the best things that has happened in the bush for a long time. It has brought the country people together with the city people, and they are working towards environmental outcomes that are good for Australia. It is a wonderful scheme. I was just concerned that Mrs Kelly's effort to politicise this particular matter did, to a certain extent, delay funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of what I said on Monday, there was a press release in Hobart about how the money had been held up. Surprise, surprise, a small item appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> today entitled `Landcare cheques are in the mail'! A spokesman for the federal Labor member for Bass said that the cheques were sent yesterday. How wonderful! They have been sitting in an office since 11 November. In regard to the one particular scheme that I was concerned about, all of the paperwork was completed and the acceptance was signed on 20 September. Up until today, the people still have not received their money. I think it is quite a coincidence that, after I raised this matter on Monday, the cheques were put in the mail yesterday. Hopefully, these people will receive their money and so will the others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to take note of that answer of Mrs Kelly's office today also, because I noticed the answer said that it had received only two calls on one of the programs and 10 calls on the other.

I can assure honourable senators that I know the office of concern in Hobart has had more than two calls. So that statement was a bit of a furphy. My major concern was, as I said earlier, the fact that Mrs Kelly was trying to get the maximum political benefit out of these grants and that has had the net effect of delaying money going to these deserving landcare schemes. I just hope that next year we do not see a repeat of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rarely speak on an adjournment debate, and I will be very brief tonight. Honourable senators may recall that yesterday I raised the issue of a South Australian company which had suffered a considerable loss because of the loss of a consultancy in Malaysia resulting from the current situation that has developed between the two countries. We heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) both yesterday and today in his answer talk about the hazards that face companies which wish to operate overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that most companies can anticipate many of the hazards that may be placed in their way. One of the hazards that they cannot anticipate is the intrusion of an intemperate remark by a Prime Minister, which has put a lot of their overseas contracts in jeopardy. Having raised that issue yesterday with regard to SEAS Sapfor, I received a letter from another South Australian company which has written to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and I think it highlights the situation of many small businesses in Australia that have been encouraged by this government to become involved in trade with South-East Asia and have spent a lot of time trying to develop these contracts and these export markets. Now they have found that, within a very short period, all of their hard work has come undone through an intemperate remark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to read into the record this one letter that I received today, because I think it says it all and I think it should be on the record. This letter is from the South Australian Horticultural Export Co. Pty Ltd, and it is addressed to the Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a telephone call from Kuala Lumpur today I am writing this letter to you, asking you, no, begging you to formally apologise to Dr Mahathir Mohamad for your recent remarks that he was "recalcitrant" for refusing to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation conference in Seattle last month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having worked extremely hard to build up a market in Malaysia for our produce, this year we exported apples to the value of $1.7m which is half our total apple exports this season. We certainly do NOT want to lose this market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst this may seem a small amount to you, to us it has been extremely important and beneficial to our company, the SA Horticultural Export Company Pty. Ltd, also very beneficial to the growers in South Australia and the South Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You and your government have been continually telling us to make export happen which will in turn help your balance of payment decrease, and we have got off our butts, gone overseas, made contacts with buyers overseas and sold produce and built up a good sound trade with markets throughout South East Asia and now with one word from you, the head of our country, these markets will come to a sudden stop.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I spoke to our agent in Kuala Lumpur today as we have been very worried by this whole incident. We have eight sea containers of apples about to reach Port Kelang today, and our agent tells me that he could not take them into Malaysia now as the buyers in the market place have put a boycott on all produce from Australia!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what happens now to those containers of apples? That is 4,000 cartons of beautiful South Australian apples!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been through a really tough time in business made tough because of your outrageously high interest rates several years back, now when we finally thought we had it sorted out and we are on the way back, a really bright light ahead of us due to the growth export markets in Malaysia, YOU stuff it all up for us with one word.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I returned from Malaysia just two weeks ago and met with buyers and agents there and they were extremely happy with the product that we have been sending to Malaysia and, in fact, were talking of increasing the volume to over $3m for next year. This may not sound a lot to you, but to the growers in this state it means expansion, money in their pockets, a return for their many hours of hard work and a little recognition for the gamble they take in planting new orchards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had a small problem in Kuching, the only way we could fix it was to go there and talk to the buyer. We did this and now there is no problem, in fact, he increased his commitment to us for next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only way to fix the problem you have created with the Malays is to do the same as we did. Pick up your phone and talk to the person, or better still go and see him and apologise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are our Prime Minister, for goodness sake!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are supposed to set the example for all of us to follow!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">YOU are the only one that can fix this problem, and I implore you to do so before it is too late. Unfortunately, a lot of damage has already been done to the "Australian image" in Malaysia and it will take a long time for them to forget your comments, but PLEASE do something before this gets out of hand completely!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the benefit of all people who do business with Malaysia, PLEASE, PLEASE APOLOGISE!!!!!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours Faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bruce Plummer.</PARA>
<PARA>He is one of the representatives of that company. Some people have suggested that the appropriate thing to do is to apologise. Only tonight, as many honourable senators did, I heard televised interviews with the Malaysians. One Malaysian made the most appropriate comment, that the Prime Minister would not lose face if he said, `I meant no offence but if my comments offended you then I am sorry'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To justify this? I do not think so. I rise to address one matter that Senator MacGibbon raised in the adjournment this evening. I am pleased to acknowledge Senator MacGibbon's statements about the scrupulous way in which the board of the CAA has conducted the selection of the air traffic control system. Like Senator MacGibbon, I believe that the sooner a decision is taken and the actual work starts the better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator MacGibbon is aware that the board has scrupulously adhered to all of the recommendations and suggestions of the Macphee report. The board's scrupulous approach is evidenced by the very detailed consideration it has given the report and the additional information it has sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only implied criticism by Senator MacGibbon concerned the date that has been set. Senator MacGibbon might be surprised to hear that I was obviously concerned about having to wait that long. I am sure that Senator MacGibbon, as a member of a number of Senate committees, is well aware of the problems that committees here have in getting everybody together at the same time. I can inform Senator MacGibbon that the chairman of the board of the CAA, General Gration, contacted me after the board meeting, simply to let me know that the board required additional information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board was concerned that when a decision is taken&mdash;as I am sure it will be&mdash;at its next meeting, a full complement will be present. I am sure that Senator MacGibbon will recall that, on the last occasion, unjust criticisms were made about the absence of two board members when a decision was taken. I very justifiably criticised the Macphee report in one area, namely, the failure of the report to acknowledge that for those two absences&mdash;absences to which the report attached some moment&mdash;proxies had been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the board is rightly conscious of the desirability of having a full complement present when its decision is taken. One board member at least was leaving immediately to go overseas, and indeed has done so.
