<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL EDUCATION (SUPPLEMENTARY ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill represents a continuation of the Commonwealth Government's commitment to the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy (AEP) which addresses the inequality of education opportunities between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act was enacted in 1989 after obtaining joint agreement from all State and Territory governments and the Commonwealth. The Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program (AESIP) which underpins the Policy was introduced in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The policy sets down 21 agreed goals for Aboriginal Education to be pursued by all governments. The Policy Statement included a commitment by the Commonwealth to supplement its normal provisions of recurrent and capital funding for education in the States and Territories with a dedicated commitment of funds on a forward triennial basis for assisting the implementation of the AEP through the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Funding provided by this bill will provide the means to continue to build on the gains achieved since 1990. Since that time the Commonwealth has funded strategic initiatives directed at improving the educational outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this second triennium of the AEP which covers the years 1993 to 1995 the Commonwealth has nominated three National Priorities. These priorities are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Responding to the relevant recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Implementing the National Aboriginal Languages and Literacy Strategy, which provides for specific initiatives for the advancement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages and literacy; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Implementing the National Reconciliation and Schooling Strategy which provides for specific schooling strategies which promote the reconciliation process between Australia's indigenous and non-indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In responding to the findings and recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, the Commonwealth Government recognises that a thrust of the recommendations is the elimination of significant social, economic and cultural disadvantages faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through a process of increased self-determination and empowerment. There needs to be continued impetus given to increasing the self esteem and confidence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specific recommendations of the Royal Commission which are addressed by funding under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 relate to the increased employment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Workers from 1993 and an expansion of pre-school services from 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1991 Budget a range of initiatives were announced as part of the White Paper on Australian Languages and Literacy. Significant elements of the White Paper are initiatives directed towards the advancement of Aboriginal Languages and Literacy, by the implementation of the National Aboriginal Languages and Literacy Strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Language Education Strategy (ALES) commenced in January 1993. ALES supports strategies geared at teaching Aboriginal languages in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Literacy Strategy (ALS), which also commenced in January 1993, supports special initiatives to improve the standard in English Literacy of Aboriginal primary and secondary students, particularly those students whose first language is not English.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third priority of the Commonwealth for this triennium is the National Reconciliation and Schooling Strategy. This strategy aims to increase the understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture among school-age children in support of the process of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much more needs to be done to ensure the continuation of efforts towards achieving our set goals, and to address the vital national  issue of ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are equally as well taught, well educated, highly motivated and successful as any other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major review of progress in implementing the AEP since its implementation in 1990 is currently underway. I hope to complete the review in time for consideration, in next year's budget, of funding for the 1996-1998 triennium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Amendment Bill 1993 provides for a modest increase in Commonwealth funding of the Aboriginal Education Strategic Initiatives Program for years 1994 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the bill is to appropriate funds to enable the Commonwealth to continue to enter into bilateral education agreements with State and Territory governments, non government school systems, Aboriginal education institutions and Aboriginal Education Consultative bodies for the provision of Aboriginal education initiatives consistent with the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has allocated some $244 million as its commitment to the AEP in the current triennium. This amount includes $17.3 million in response to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, specifically targeted to provide additional preschool places and additional Aboriginal Education Workers. In addition, an amount of $16.8 million has been included for Aboriginal Languages and Literacy initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for the appropriation of $82,966,000 in 1994 and $83,919,000 in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to four amendments to veterans' entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first deals with the government's budget announcement concerning eligibility for benefits under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme. Children of veterans who receive Extreme Disablement Adjustment will now be eligible for assistance under the Scheme. This measure will align the benefits available to children of Extreme Disablement Adjustment pensioners with those available to children of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three remaining measures are non-budget amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed to extend the sunset clause which governs the operation of Advance Pharmaceutical Allowance. These provisions allow a lump sum payment of pharmaceutical allowance of up to seven payments to be made to chronically-ill pensioners who have a high prescription drug use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without this extension, the sunset clause would repeal Advance Pharmaceutical Allowance from 1 January 1994. The proposed amendment will extend the operation of the advance payments for a further 12 months. This will enable a review to take place on the pharmaceutical requirements of chronically-ill persons who access these payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second of the non-budget amendments deals with the assessment of allocated pensions and annuities. These types of investment are similar in structure to a managed investment and can be drawn upon by the purchaser at a rate and amount desired, until the balance of the account is exhausted. An allocated pension or annuity gives the purchaser some control over the amount of return and when it is received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Veterans' Entitlements Act does not expressly provide the rules under which this form of investment is assessed. The proposed amendment will align the assessment of allocated pensions and annuities with managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will ensure consistency in the method of assessing allocated pensions and annuities with similar provisions in the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last of the three is a minor amendment to the definition of `shares and listed securities'. This definition was inserted into the Act to provide that the income and asset value of shares were assessed in accordance with the managed investment rules. It defined shares as only those listed on a stock exchange in Australia. Concerns have been raised that by limiting the application of the definition in this manner, it may be seen as an incentive for pensioners to divest themselves of their Australian shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This initiative proposes an amendment to the definition of `shares and listed securities' to ensure that it applies to both Australian and foreign-sourced shares. It will align the treatment of shares and listed securities with similar provisions in the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 was last the subject of extensive amendment in 1987 when provision was made for State law enforcement agencies' use of interception. After some experience had been obtained in the administration of the amended provisions, the Act was reviewed by the Attorney-General's Department. The review looked at the experience of the various agencies which are given specific roles to perform under the Act and also took into account the need for the Act to reflect developments in the provision of telecommunications services arising from either technological innovations or the implementation of the industry reforms contained in the Telecommunications Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1991 a discussion paper was published and comments were invited from the public. Copies were sent to organisations that had expressed an interest in the subject. Although few comments were received the review team had regard to those that were in framing its recommendations to the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill contains amendments to the Act which the Government believes are desirable following its consideration of the review. The amendments address some current practical problems with the Act without disturbing the Act's present balance between privacy interests and law enforcement. While many of the Bill's provisions are of a technical or administrative nature, designed to rectify some minor defects in the scheme of the Act, there are some significant aspects which deserve to be brought to the attention of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant change relates to the manner in which warrants are executed. Currently, the sole responsibility for executing warrants issued to a law enforcement agency&mdash;State or Federal&mdash;lies with the Telecommunications Interception Division (TID) of the AFP. That Division's role was developed in 1987 as a means of strengthening privacy protection and ensuring that there was federal control over interceptions. It is for the same reason that the Act also currently requires that, subject to a limited exception, interceptions may only be done as a result of action taken by employees of the carrier operating the service specified in a warrant, rather than directly by the police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act's requirements that the TID of the AFP execute all warrants has led to the development of a cumbersome and costly set of arrangements. These arrangements require all intercepted signals to be routed from a target exchange, wherever it is located in Australia, to the TID's facilities in Canberra where the signals are recorded at the same time as they are re-routed to the monitoring centre of the law enforcement agency which applied for the warrant. This process can result in loss or corruption of signal quality, involves considerable expense and gives rise to some risk to the security of interception operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposes to replace these arrangements with a new system which will resolve most of the current deficiencies. As is the case at present, the new system will ensure that a law enforcement agency will only be able to receive intercepted signals as a result of the AFP's taking action for the purpose of giving effect to a warrant. The AFP will also retain the ability to disconnect an interception directly when, for example, a warrant has expired. The technology by which this is achieved is a computer controlled cross-point switcher, which was developed by the Victorian Police. Its advantages include better signal quality and reliability at a lower cost. The new system will also provide greater security since intercepted signals will no longer be diverted through Canberra. Existing reporting mechanisms will be enhanced by a requirement for a register of warrants to be kept and regularly submitted for ministerial inspection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides for the Australian Federal Police, or the police force of a State or Territory, to monitor or record telephone calls without a warrant in certain emergency situations. To respond to certain emergencies, such as sieges, kidnappings or hostage-taking incidents, the police usually communicate with the perpetrators by telephone and often need to provide facilities to allow a second negotiator or medical professional to monitor conversations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a general rule, the Act prohibits a person from recording a conversation without the knowledge of the person speaking. Subsection 6(2) of the Act already provides an exception to that rule in cases where a person uses customer equipment for which AUSTEL has issued a permit authorising connection to the telecommunications network, but AUSTEL's usual practice is to authorise such equipment only where the  equipment emits at regular intervals a pip-tone that helps to put people on notice that a recording is taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the potential adverse effect on the rights of individuals, the Government does not believe that it is appropriate for the police to record telephone conversations in the types of emergency situations I have described without clear statutory criteria. Accordingly, the Bill provides that the authority to record conversations without a warrant will only arise in specified circumstances, namely, where a police officer is a party to a conversation in situations of emergency involving actual or threatened loss of life or serious personal injury or damage to property, or with the permission of a person who is likely to receive ransom or extortion demands. In the former case, a test to be satisfied by the police is that, because of the urgency of the need to record the relevant conversations, it was not practical to apply for the issue of a warrant under the Act. This test does not have to be satisfied in the latter case as the consent of the innocent party is a prerequisite. Police use of this authority will be reported to the minister and will be recorded in the annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Government accepted two Opposition amendments moved in another place. The first extends the requirement of urgency to participant monitoring with the permission of a person who is likely to receive ransom or extortion demands. The second requires the police to seek a warrant as soon as practicable after engaging in participant monitoring in emergency situations. If a warrant is not given, any continuing monitoring must cease. The Government accepts that these proposals will confirm its commitment to the protection of privacy without detracting from the capacity of police authorities to act firmly and quickly in emergency situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment made by the Bill is to remove the current restriction which confines a State agency's ability to seek a warrant to telephone services located in its own State. The Government does not believe such a restriction is appropriate since important investigations may be frustrated by a suspect's moving inter-state. The removal of the restriction means that a State agency will still only be able to seek the issue of a warrant for the purpose of investigating an offence in the course of performing its functions. That means that a State law enforcement agency could only successfully apply for a warrant authorising interception of a service outside the relevant State if it could persuade the issuing Judge that there is a reasonable nexus between the service specified in the warrant application and the agency's investigation of an offence for which it has responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for a number of other amendments, such as the inclusion of offences against Part VIA of the Crimes Act 1914, dealing with computer crimes, in the category of offences for which an interception warrant may be sought, the inclusion of the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission in the list of State agencies which may, subject to meeting certain statutory pre-conditions, become entitled to apply for warrants and the inclusion in the annual report made under the Act of additional information relating to the costs associated with the performance of interceptions by law enforcement agencies. Details of cost have been included in the 1991/92 annual report in anticipation of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is anticipated that the Bill's financial impact will be to reduce the overall cost of interception by about $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL TRAINING AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL (No.2)1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes some minor amendments to the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to insert a new provision in relation to the transfer of certain programs from the Commonwealth to the Authority and to correct an unrelated drafting oversight in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Training Authority was established formally in December 1992 following an agreement between Heads of Government in July of that year. The planning and funding arrangements for the new National Vocational Education and Training System, outlined in the agreement, come into full effect from the beginning of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the new arrangements, the Authority will assume responsibility for administering certain Commonwealth programs, currently administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which `support training activities and services which are national in scope and purpose'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth-State Ministerial Council which oversees the Authority agreed, in April this year, on the programs to be transferred to the Authority. These `National Programs' provide catalytic and ongoing support for implementation of key aspects of the national training reform agenda. They include measures to support the development of industry-relevant, nationally consistent competency-based training; to encourage involvement of the industry parties in the planning and provision of vocational education and training; and to improve access and equity in our training system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Council also agreed that, as the transfer of programs will take place mid-way through the financial year, the Authority should take over responsibility for current grants as well as uncommitted funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give effect to the Council's decision it will be necessary to transfer to the Authority responsibility for relevant agreements which the Commonwealth has entered into with grant recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides a simple mechanism for the transfer which will result in minimum disruption to program clients. Under the new provision, the Minister or his delegate may declare that a specified agreement is to become the responsibility of the Authority. Once the declaration comes into effect, the Authority replaces the Commonwealth as a party to the  agreement. The declaration cannot take effect until a copy is given to the other party to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of this bill is minor. There will be some administrative costs involved in processing declarations made under the new provision, and transferring relevant documentation from the Department to the Authority. However, the mechanism provided by the bill is expected to be more cost-effective than the alternative of renegotiating or varying a large number of individual agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also corrects a drafting oversight in the Act by providing that the definition of `year' in the Act does not apply to Section 27. The definition of `year' as `a calendar year beginning on or after 1 January 1994' was clearly not intended to apply to this Section, which provides for members of the Authority to be appointed for a period of up to three years. The purpose of legislating to create the Authority in late 1992 was to permit it to undertake the planning necessary for full implementation of the new arrangements in 1994. The members were, in fact, appointed shortly after the Act received Royal Assent in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments which I have outlined will allow for the Australian National Training Authority to assume responsibility for National Programs and related agreements from 1 January 1994. The Authority, with these and other important responsibilities, will play a key role in the development of a more effective national vocational education and training system for the benefit of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">  SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT BILL   (No 2) 1993</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Amendment Bill (No 2) 1993 gives effect to a number of measures that were announced in the 1993 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a $3 a week increase in the rate of Newstart Allowance paid to certain single recipients aged 21 and over without dependent children. The rate increase is an acknowledgment that the relative position of this group has fallen compared with other income support recipients. This increase will take effect from 20 March 1994 and will be additional to the indexation increase that has already occurred on that date. It will not apply to single recipients who are aged 60 or more, don't have any dependent children and have been in receipt of social security benefit continuously for at least 6 months as they already receive a higher rate of Newstart Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income and assets tests have previously been introduced for basic family payment to ensure that financial assistance is targeted towards those families with the greatest need. Given the current fiscal situation, the Government decided that the relatively generous limits should be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that on 1 January 1994, the income ceiling limit for basic family payment for families with one child will be reduced from $64,938 to $60,000. The additional amount allowed for each extra child will be reduced from $3,249 to $3,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also on 1 January 1994, the existing assets test limit for basic family payment will be reduced from $607,250 to $550,000. However, the hardship rules that allow the operation of the assets test to be waived in certain circumstances will continue to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families receiving a prescribed educational scheme payment are currently exempt from the basic and additional family payment income tests and from the additional family payment assets test simply because they receive a prescribed educational scheme payment. This means that a family receives family payment or additional family payment even if their income exceeds the relevant income test limit or may receive additional family payment even if the value of their assets exceeds the additional family payment assets test limit. The bill removes this inequity from 1 January 1994 by placing such families in the same situation, in terms of their total income assistance and support package, as other families who do not receive prescribed educational scheme payments such as AUSTUDY.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social security clients must comply with notification requirements so that their payments can be administered efficiently. There can be complications, especially for the regular family payment review, when clients change address without notifying the Department and cannot therefore respond to notices sent to them. To overcome such complications, highlighted by the cases of O'Connell and Sevel, the act will now make it a requirement for a family payment client to notify a change of address. There will also be a new discretionary power to suspend family payment if a person has been informed about having to notify a change of address but fails to respond to a notice because of a change of address. The current limitation on arrears provisions, should a decision to cancel or reduce payments be subsequently overturned on review, is also to be reinforced in light of the O'Connell and Sevel cases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a number of issues with the minister in regard to some questions that affect a number of the consequential amendments that are currently being proposed by Senator Hill. Of course, these reflect the impact this legislation is going to have on transport and on the delivery of services in remote and rural parts of Australia. People in remote and isolated rural areas pay disproportionately more now for consumer goods. I have seen various estimates given as to what the impact will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it has been argued that an average basket of groceries will increase by the order of $3 if the full costs of the diesel excise and sales tax are passed on to consumers. Secondly, it has been argued that higher transport costs will threaten the viability of value added processing in regional areas of Australia, as `every stage in the production process receives more expensive transport costs'. Thirdly, it has been argued that the impact of this legislation will undermine regional development, for example, through increases in transport costs, which will reduce the viability of locating industries outside the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact is certainly going to be quite significant in all of these areas. It is very interesting to note a quote by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, when he was the shadow minister for minerals and energy in 1980. Mr Keating said at that time, `It is a shocking thing that every petrol pump has become an office of the Tax Department'. That quote, of course, must now be coming back to haunt the Prime Minister in relation to the impact of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first set of questions I expect the minister to address relate to what studies have been undertaken on the impact of this legislation and the effect on transport costs and how they have been taken into account. The second issue I wish to raise relates to those amendments that will impact on mineral processing, and particularly the mineral processing operations dependent on fuel oil with no alternative energy source. For example, in the Northern Territory, Nabalco's Gove alumina plant&mdash;the largest Australian consumer of fuel oil&mdash;faces an extra cost of $25 million to its operation. Additionally, the higher coastal shipping costs will reduce Australia's international competitiveness across a range of minerals processed in Australia, whether it is alumina from Nabalco or manganese from the BHP Groote Eylandt plant in the Northern Territory on its way to the BHP plant in north-eastern Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pose again the second round of questions. I think it is important for the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) to address them. The questions specifically relate to the impact on the Gove project. Given the evidence that was presented to the Senate committee by Nabalco on this matter, I would like to ascertain from the government what further discussions and consultations have been undertaken by the minister, by the Treasurer, by Senator Collins and by Mr Snowdon with regard to accommodating the major impacts that were highlighted. I also highlighted them in my speech at the second reading stage. Further on this particular matter, I ask the minister, and the Greens, to address this issue with regard to the impact the costs will have at Gove. The unintended consequence is that those costs are going to flow through in a very significant way to the Aboriginal community of north-east Arnhem Land</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that point on two grounds. Firstly, the mining royalties that flow to Aboriginal people are very dependent on the profitability of this particular project, and the chairman of the Northern Land Council&mdash;indeed, one of the traditional owners of the Gove area&mdash;Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, has substantially argued this. He accused the federal government of duplicity. I am referring to a media report about the $25 million oil tax increase. Mr Yunupingu argues that, while the Commonwealth has increased the tax with a stroke of a bureaucratic pen, Aborigines are being cheated of royalties. The impact of that increase is going to be very direct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Aboriginal community of Gove&mdash;where the power is generated by the Nabalco operation, which therefore affects the cost to the Aboriginal communities&mdash;will be very closely affected. In Yirrkala, and in Mr Yunupingu's own area and the township of Nhulunbuy, where some 3,500 people live, consumer costs will be directly affected. As I said, the questions I expect the minister to address relate to the transport surveys, to the costs, and to the impact this legislation will have on Nabalco. We have argued before about the sovereign risk and a number of other things. More importantly, what has the government done to alleviate and address the impact this is going to have at Gove? In particular, how will the government compensate, and how, therefore, will the Greens compensate the residents of an isolated and major community?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate and accept that Senator Tambling is trying to facilitate the debate on the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill and I have had a discussion with Senator Hill in the same way. I am not sure that we will totally succeed in that by being able to discuss simultaneously all the matters before us, but I am prepared to cooperate for as long as it looks as if we are actually achieving that purpose of expedition. Senator Tambling would not be stunned to know that I think that was a series of questions scarcely getting to the question but rather full of rhetorical flourishes. Fine, there is nothing wrong with making rhetorical flourishes in the committee; that is part of what we all do in making our points more effectively and I am happy to respond to them. I will try not to be lengthy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no proposal, however, for special studies into the impact of this particular change. It is not qualitatively new; all that is changing is the amount. I am not saying that that is irrelevant. I am saying that the studies that have gone on in Australia for decades about transport economics and the implications of fuel prices on transport are as relevant to these changes as to any of the other changes that governments of both political parties have made over the last 20, 30 or however many years one would like to take. There is not anything new that would require a whole new series of studies to learn things which are qualitatively different from all that has gone before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the remote communities and the Aboriginal communities, I do not in this matter distinguish between Aboriginal communities and others. I understand that Senator Tambling thought he might dangle a carrot in front of the Greens by saying, `Shock, horror, some of the people who will lose and who will have to pay this tax indirectly by lesser return might be Aboriginal people', but they are still Australians. The situation is that we have the same application of the law to everybody. There is nothing in any proposals we might have in which we seek to assist Aboriginal Australians by saying that, if there is a business they have got some benefit from, we are going to give it special tax treatment to make it a more successful business so that more of the profits can go to Switzerland. We are not going to do that. That is a bit of a red herring. </PARA>

We were going to initiate an amendment of that sort; when Senator Harradine did so, we indicated in the second reading and by our vote in the committee stage that we supported his amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would also oppose this amendment to the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill but for somewhat different reasons. We are very worried that the opposition repeatedly sees the world in terms of the 1950s and 1960s and assumes that the world of tomorrow is going to be exactly the same. As I pointed out yesterday, the indications both from the bureau of resources and from the petroleum exploration industry itself are that we have seven years supply of petroleum left in Australia and that the prospects and hopes for new oil have been very much downgraded in recent years. We have not found oil in the Timor Gap as we expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs to Australia of imports will rise from $4 billion in the current year to $9 billion by the year 2000. Simply to keep the price of fuel low in order to give some assistance to a transport industry that is based on old technology might be of benefit now but in the long term it will be disastrous for this country. For quite different reasons, we are supporting the government's increase in the excise&mdash;to make more economic and to bring on-line more quickly the alternative fuels, which are non-polluting and which will be derived from indigenous sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope&mdash;it is a forlorn hope, obviously&mdash;that the opposition will look somewhat beyond just this year and next year and will see that, if Australia is going to have a future at all in the very areas which are of concern, it must accept the fact that we have to write into the costs of the use of resources the proper costs of those resources, which include the pollution costs and the fact that the resources being used are non-renewable. We have to write in a factor which relates to the legitimate demands on those resources by future generations of Australians and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, petroleum is grossly underpriced, and we need to shift the balance for environmental reasons and for very sound longer-term or mid-term economic reasons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should probably make one further point at this stage. It is not exclusively relevant to this request but it relates to many of the requests moved by the Greens and the coalition in the form&mdash;this is the first one we have come to in this form&mdash;where we are defining the rate to be imposed on a particular good or category of goods by their use. In both those instances, it starts to raise potentially tricky constitutional questions. If we are proposing to base the rate of tax on actual use rather than intended use&mdash;intended use is what happens at the point of sale and actual use is what happens at the point of consumption, and they are quite different, on my advice, in terms of what form of tax it is that we are imposing; if we are in this bill mainly imposing taxes that operate in that first category but we are seeking to add to it taxes the rates of which are determined by the actual end use of particular goods, I think we have a potential problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the clause immediately before us, if it is carried&mdash;I am confident from what I have heard that it will not be&mdash;it probably will not have any immediate effect because there probably will not be a rate differential particularly for this use. But if we carry some of the subsequent amendments, where it seems that the Greens' position and the coalition's position overlap, I think we are starting to get into a potential constitutional problem with regard to combining excises with consumption taxes. I was not aware of this. It has just been drawn to my attention, so I do not want to put a definitive view. Given how conservatively the Senate has up until now wished to pursue any potential constitutional concerns I flag it as a point of concern, but I do not at this stage want to exaggerate it out of its proper significance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought Senator Hill might say that. The most appropriate immediate option is one of the reasons why the government will be opposing all of these amendments. That is not the only reason. We are opposing them for other reasons, which we have articulated plenty of times&mdash;I am not going to waste the committee's time doing it again&mdash;which have to do with both environmental consequences, as Senator Coulter mentioned, and revenue consequences. I do not blush about that. It is a revenue measure. Potentially serious constitutional concerns have been drawn to my attention and I think we need to consider them. It would be irresponsible not to put them on the table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators can see the distinction I am making. It is possible to interpret all of those clauses as saying that they are about intended use. Senator Hill's amendment refers to `automotive diesel oil other than for use in rail or road transport services'. I am told that in the past it has been quite possible to interpret that as saying that the intention at the point of sale was that they were for rail or road transport services and therefore it is constitutional and does not raise a problem. But it raises an enormous administrative problem then because it is hard to see who would buy any automotive diesel oil and say that the intention at the time of purchase was to use it other than for rail or road transport services. I think that the use for any other purpose would be nil; that was the intention at the time. Afterwards the person might have changed his mind and used it for some other purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not on its face unconstitutional, but once it is interpreted constitutionally&mdash;that is to say, as to the intention&mdash;it raises some serious questions that I felt obliged to draw to the committee's attention.

But, wittingly or unwittingly, in the way he has put his argument&mdash;I am sure it was unwittingly&mdash;he has tended to imply that renewable resources are preferable to non-renewable resources on the basis that somehow or other people get something for nothing. As the honourable senator knows very well, the first law of thermodynamics is that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can be changed from one form to another.

My understanding&mdash;this is the point I was making about the distinction between intended use and actual use&mdash;is that where such for-use distinctions apply at the moment they are interpreted as being on the basis of intended use and they operate within fairly limited categories where the intention is discernible by the nature of the product. For example, kerosene particularly for use in aircraft is a product discernibly different from others and so the intention is discernible on the face of the product. That is my advice, but it is part of further information I will seek for the committee if we get further discussion on this matter. Without either the desire or the possibility of restricting people's right to comment on this, I think it might be more fruitful if we do it at a subsequent stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think Senator McMullan was trying to draw a parallel between his concerns over whether the terms should be in relation to the use of a good or the intended use of a good and our concerns in relation to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bills Nos. 1 and 2. With the greatest respect to Senator McMullan, I point out that there is a distinction. Passage of those bills by the Senate meant that they required only assent to become acts of parliament, whereas the passage by the Senate of a resolution requesting an amendment does not necessarily change the bill and does not flow immediately into law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could, that is a thought. Yes, I could start making them as well. But I think I can give Senator Margetts the message enough in here. I put this on record yesterday, and I remind her today, that it is totally unfair to put an extra tax on road that is not on rail. As I said yesterday, sea transport is different. But it is going to start increasing those costs on roads and it provides further unfair competition between road and rail. As I said yesterday, it will not transfer those goods back on to rail simply by doing that, with the safety angle and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that a lot of people reckon there should be fewer heavy vehicles on roads, that that would make it safer for the motorists. But it has to be worked out whether the roads were made for transporting goods in the first place, or whether it was simply for cars, for people getting to work or for pleasure. People have got to work that out in their own minds. One cannot differentiate between road and rail to give transporters an unfair advantage over each other. I am sure Senator Margetts has slept on it. She has received those phone calls and I think she will vote accordingly, or change her amendment accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 is going to raise an extra $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion, something like that. After all, this levy was originally imposed in the Malcolm Fraser days, to be spent on roads. But, of course, the government has used every bowser as a tax collector. They are not my words; they are the words of the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer. But with this extra money that has been raised, the money allocated to roads in the last budget has gone down by about $550 million as against what it was last year. I know spending on roads was boosted a certain amount, as Senator West should know, in the One Nation package. But now it has dropped in real terms. I would say we have dropped road spending in Australia by 20 or 30 per cent. So if the government wanted to increase the diesel fuel levy&mdash;a levy on all fuel&mdash;by a certain amount, the 2c we are talking about now plus what we have already done with 3c now and 2c next year in two stages, then I thought they would have allocated more for roads. With the demand on the road system around Australia, the standard is going down. Senator Woodley should know what the standards are, coming from Queensland. The roads of New South Wales are fortunately picking up, because there is a Liberal government there, aided by the Nats, of course. </PARA>

But one would think that the government would allocate more money for roads out of this. No, they increased the fuel levy and, by the same token, they have brought the roads down. I believe that the government should look at increased spending. It is the only one that can control this, especially with this increased take. With the sales tax legislation that raises $1 billion extra, that affects road transport as well because sales tax is paid on tyres; sales tax is paid these days on oil, on parts and everything with transport. Yet none of that extra is going back to roads, and I believe it should.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think I heard him say that Australia has only seven years reserves of crude oil. That might be known, publicly declared reserves; no companies in their right mind, but especially the ones that want to keep the price of oil up, would tell the whole world exactly how much oil reserves they have. I know from the few people I talk to that in the Timor Sea they discover a lot of oil, wells are put down, and then they are simply plugged for another day, when they need it or are looking for higher prices or something like that. So there may be seven years of declared, known reserves, but there are also the unknown reserves, as well as  a  lot  of  exploration  in  the  next  seven years. </PARA>

He said that he was told by this professor&mdash;I cannot remember his name&mdash;that by 1992 the only oil in the world would be used in medicine. Remember that this was in 1973.

I remind the committee that diesel excise was introduced as a means of collecting the necessary road funding but, while road freight has trebled in the last 20 years&mdash;more than twice the growth rate of the economy, with major benefit to the Australian economy&mdash;road expenditure has reduced.

There are other ways in which the assistance should be provided to rail. It should be extended through systems which recognise that differential in the energy efficiency. That is more likely to be realised through increasing the cost of energy overall, which, as I have argued consistently throughout this debate, should occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of energy from fossil fuels should rise because the true costs, the full costs, the costs in relation to the fact that these are non-renewable resources, the costs in relation to the pollution effects and the costs in relation to greenhouse gases have not been properly factored in. While the motivation of the government in putting an excise in there is not to factor in those costs, nonetheless that is their effect; and that is the reason we support them. To the extent that the cost of fossil fuel increases, then the greater efficiency of rail in terms of its use of those fossil resources will be realised quite naturally. The market itself will recognise that. That is the appropriate way, I believe, that government should operate. It should set the parameters and then the market should determine, and one of the parameters has to be an increase in the cost of fossil fuel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. The government opposes this request. I did not get up merely to state that because it is obvious, but we are trying to expedite proceedings today. We do not want to have innumerable divisions. This is a situation where the arithmetic of the chamber appears to indicate that the government may lose and that this request may be carried. It is a request that has very significant revenue implications. There are a couple of others that we are concerned about, but we are not going to call divisions on all of them. If, on the voices, this goes against us, we will call a division simply to make it clear that we cannot allow this level of impact on the revenue to go unremarked. It will be the only division that we will call on this. This is just to establish the point and to prove the arithmetic. We are trying to cooperate in the expeditious handling of this, so we will call this division but no other.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The request that has just been carried related to automotive diesel oil for use in rail services. This one relates to automotive diesel oil for use in road transport services. For the very convincing arguments that have been put particularly by Senator Panizza, it seems logical and sensible for the Senate now to pass this one also. I do not want to repeat the arguments but we have to consider the comparative advantages if the costs on one are reduced or maintained. Bearing in mind the hundreds, if not thousands, of small haulage vehicles around Australia, small businesses which are critical to employment, it is very important now that this request also be carried. So for the argument of competitive advantage and for the argument of simply creating economic growth, jobs, expansion and new opportunities in this country, it becomes equally important that this request be carried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of a few minutes ago, it seemed to me that we did not have the numbers on this. I would particularly like to ask the Greens to reconsider. It seems to me that on these matters the Australian Democrats are past the point of no return. Senator Coulter's argument in relation to the last amendment, which was about reducing the excise for rail, I found astounding. If ever the Democrats would come into this chamber and vote yes, I would have thought it would be to give a comparative advantage to rail. But this is just another example of the illogical stances they seem to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was the Democrats that had the nerve to embrace the government's deficit reduction strategy. I can only remind the committee that this is the government that before the last election was talking about tax cuts being l-a-w, not a promise. Members of the government said, `There is no way that this will be changed'. Of course, immediately after the election, they abandoned that stance and they have brought legislation into this place to demonstrate that breach of promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the government has said to us in the budget, `Do not look at it as just this budget. We have now put down a four-year strategy. Take us on our honour in relation to four years hence'. If government members cannot keep their promises between immediately before the election and immediately after the election, what real credibility can we give to a strategy that this lot brings down that is supposed to take place four years hence, in the unfortunate event that they are still in government? I am amazed that the Democrats are prepared to embrace that argument to help justify their illogical position on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now dealing specifically with the issue of road transport. In one of the road transport amendments I feel that I must test the numbers in the chamber because it is such a critical industry to Australia's economic welfare.

The government rejected that. The situation is that this is the government's budget. The lack of passage of the budget is clearly doing damage to Australia.

<PARA>As Senator Hill said, this is basically the same request for amendment that was foreshadowed yesterday in relation to diesel fuel used for the generation of electricity by people in remote areas who do not have access to electricity coming from either an electricity power station or substation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This request for an amendment is basically to catch those people who live with no reasonable access to electricity from a power station or substation. The number of people so affected is quite small. Those people are predominantly in northern Western Australia and northern Queensland, and we understand that there is a very small number in South Australia, the Northern Territory and the western districts of New South Wales. The greatest number are concentrated in the area of Queensland north of the Daintree River and west of the Northern Territory border. These are predominantly people who cannot get access to electricity because environmental constraints at the moment prevent the introduction of electricity through certain World Heritage areas. These people do not live in World Heritage areas but are affected by them and would be severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the number of users is very small. I was asked yesterday by Senator Woodley outside the chamber what my estimate of the cost of this is. I repeat for Senator Woodley's benefit and for the benefit of all honourable senators that my understanding is that the cost would probably be less than $2 million, but in any event not more than $5 million. We are talking about roughly 5c a litre, so I think $2 million is probably quite generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is basically one of geographical equity. Do we discriminate against people who are already suffering a higher cost burden for the basic amenities of life by virtue of their geographical isolation? I think most honourable senators would accept that we should not discriminate where people have no other reasonable access to power. In many cases, alternative power sources are of no substantive value, for either geographical or climatic reasons. I understand that there are some areas where solar power is feasible, but it is certainly not feasible in some areas of Queensland, because of the wet season, and there are similar constraints on the use of wind power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would address the very real and pressing need those people have. It was indicated to me yesterday that we have the agreement of the Democrats in relation to the amendment. I hope we will receive in the chamber today the support of other honourable senators, notably the Greens and Senator Harradine. I am not sure of the position of the government, but I assume that, consistent with its position in relation to other amendments, it is not disposed to support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope honourable senators will recognise the importance of this matter because of the grave disadvantage these people suffer and the need for some of the burden to be alleviated, especially as the cost to the Commonwealth is very small and the cost to these people is very great. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to support my colleague Senator O'Chee on this amendment, although I have not seen the wording. I am quite surprised at the small figure Senator O'Chee has put on it. Perhaps the minister can tell us later on exactly what difference it is going to make to revenue. It is an important issue. Power generation is dear enough when one has to generate one's own power, without having an increase in the price of fuel. Taking into account the depreciation of the plant, especially the smaller ones, per unit of power it is far more costly than SEC power. It is not only the small, isolated areas Senator O'Chee referred to that are affected; a lot of the farming areas in Western Australia as well as in the rest of Australia are not on the grid. I am therefore a little surprised at the figure Senator O'Chee has given. There is also an effect where power is generated for mines in remote areas. I know that there is a rebate on diesel fuel for mining, although not as much as for farm use.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am coming to that. I am glad Senator Watson reminded me of that. There is a rebate for mining but it is only in the operation of the mine&mdash;the transport of ore and making the mining pit. Everything in the pit uses diesel, whether to power the trucks or to generate power for the electric shovel. But when we come to the treatment plant, which is part of the mine but is a separate entity, whether it is on the mine site or in a central site for other pits, there is no rebate. The power for those pits has to be generated by diesel, and there are umpteen of these pits, including at Karratha in Western Australia, the chief mining state. All the power in Karratha is generated by diesel, unless I am mighty wrong. If I am wrong, please tell me, but that was so last time I was up there. That has a great effect on the cost of power, including the cost of power to households.</PARA></TALK.START>

It might help my case if I thought everybody did understand it to mean that, but I am sure that it does not. It is designed to be more limited. If it were possible, given both the constitutional question I mentioned before and the procedural question I am about to go to, to draw the boundary in the manner Senator O'Chee outlined, it may be an argument, but it is not. It may well be a moving argument, because all Australians have a natural concern for the problems of people living in remote areas. It touches all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I heard her correctly, Senator Margetts interjected about alternative energy sources that might be very useful and worthwhile in those areas.

It is certainly a powerful argument that maybe we should be providing encouragement for them to do more innovative things in the generation of their electricity than use industrial diesel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with the request is twofold. One is merely to reiterate the potential constitutional problem I referred to before. Secondly, after the end user purchases this diesel and says, `I am going to use this to generate electricity', how do we ensure that that is what happens, unless we have an army of inspectors running around checking?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But that is not what this says. It is a matter of what sort of encouragement we should give to people in these circumstances, people whom most, if not all, of us would like to assist in some way, although not necessarily through their electricity costs. I am not sure that that is the best way, but that is a different argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, on balance, we did say that these people warrant our assistance and the rest of Australia's taxpayers should in some way provide them with more assistance, it would be safer, better policy and administratively more manageable if we were to do it by way of a rebate of the sort that applies in other related circumstances. So we do not support this request. It would be impossible to argue passionately that these are people not worthy of assistance, but it is a bit arbitrary in the choice of how the assistance is provided, and is not the appropriate way of providing it. So we oppose the request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody raised a question about the cost. The reason we cannot give a figure is that use would just spill over the definitional boundary and would be incapable of being constrained.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for his comments. He is quite correct that the intention of the amendment is not such that it catches communities where a council runs a generator for the purposes of providing power to the whole of the community. All of us on this side of the chamber would support that. This amendment, however, is not designed to catch those situations. We were mindful of the concerns of some in the chamber in relation to the cost blow-out and that is why this particular amendment was drawn quite narrowly. The fact that these people have to generate power themselves is of importance because it means that they have no communal means even of generating the power. So we are talking about quite isolated and limited groups of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan raises two points in relation to the request for amendment. The first is the constitutional point, which I do not want to labour too much. I repeat my comments before, that this is merely a request for amendment and does not immediately alter the bill. Upon the Senate's agreeing to this request for amendment, if it is so minded, the passage of the bill does not occur automatically. In fact, the bill has to go back to the House of Representatives; so it would not automatically become law. There is ample opportunity to further examine that constitutional question and maybe find ways to rectify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Senator McMullan's second point, he has concerns about how this is administered. This scheme really is governed by the same administrative principles as applied to other schemes which have been agreed to in this chamber this morning in a successful request for amendment by Senator Hill in relation to similar exemptions. In any situation it can be asked: how is it administered? It is obviously administered on the basis of reasonableness. These are not people who are farmers. This would not apply to farmers who would purchase the fuel and then put it in their farm machinery, because they are already caught by the farmers' diesel fuel rebate. So they are not going to be utilising this means as a way of avoiding fuel excise because, in fact, this gives a lower return than if a person claimed it under the diesel fuel excise rebate as a farmer. I suppose that is the principal concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about other people, I am really at a loss to work out who we are referring to. If one is referring to people using vehicles, I think the category is very small. In fact, there is a fairly easy way to tell. They are either going to put the fuel in a drum, or they are going to put it in the tank of the vehicle. While Senator McMullan's concerns are honestly held, they are probably a little inflated in terms of the possible cost to the revenue. I think the level of difficulty with this is quite low, given the matters I have already outlined. Therefore, the Senate should not be concerned that it is going to place an enormous cost burden upon the Commonwealth.

Those farmers and miners who use diesel fuel get a rebate for the use of diesel fuel for farming and mining and, as I understand it, that does not apply to use for generating power.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also my understanding&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that there is no excise on fuel for generating if you are using coal or hydro power. There are some communities&mdash;the minister should be aware of this&mdash;which are too remote to get their electricity from the mains electricity supply. In those instances, and this is where I have come across them, shire councils run the electricity scheme. It seems a bit unfair that people in those smaller communities have to pay an excise, or a tax, on the fuel that is used to generate their electricity, whereas people who are living in the capital cities, and other parts of Australia, do not have that same tax on whatever fuel they use to generate their power. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very sympathetic to this amendment, but the Australian Democrats have some real problems with it. It is causing a fair amount of confusion for us. I would like to make an appeal to the Opposition, in this instance, to not go this way but to go another way. I believe it would be much easier for the Democrats to support this proposition if the amendment were to be to the diesel fuel rebate scheme so that the compensation could be made at that point. My problem is that, in the party room, we discussed the amendment that we had before us yesterday, and this morning, which spoke about fuel oil and not about industrial diesel fuel. Fuel oil is a different kettle of fish altogether. We had real problems because we could see fuel oil applying to a whole lot of uses and not applying to the generation of electricity through small generators, which do not use fuel oil. Honourable senators can see that we were a bit caught out by the change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us, even if we are excluding pastoralists&mdash;they use the diesel rebate scheme to compensate their uses of diesel fuel&mdash;that small remote communities, and Aboriginal communities, would also use industrial diesel fuel to run their four-wheel drives and tractors, et cetera. I am assuming this, so I am happy to be corrected on that at this point. Aboriginal communities have all of this equipment, as well as generators. Therefore, we have still got the same problem. The amendment certainly says, `for consumption by commercial and private consumers'. It seems to me that the amendment is still so general that it is difficult for us to support it in this form. However, I think we would be prepared to look at an amendment to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to allay some of Senator Woodley's concerns, which I think were twofold. The first was in relation to the possibility of misuse by, for example, Aboriginal communities or people who had four-wheel drives or tractors. The use of a tractor would be principally for primary industry anyway and would therefore be caught by the existing diesel fuel excise rebate scheme. In relation to four-wheel drives, in any scheme there is always the possibility of a little bit of slippage, but it is fairly easy to work out exactly how much fuel people are using for what purpose. We are talking about isolated communities and their fuel consumption is fairly normal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do apologise for the change that occurred overnight. It was brought to my attention only this morning when I came into the chamber. The diligent staff that we have had been looking at it overnight to check that everything was right. Honourable senators would recall that last night the whole debate became very complex. Those on our side sought to make sure that everything was thoroughly in order and had made a number of changes to various amendments; this was one. The whole purpose was to clarify the issue and to alleviate the possibility of misuse of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley has concern about the word `commercial'. I will explain why the word `commercial' has been inserted. If, for example, one has a small outback store, one needs to run a generator to provide electricity for the store as well as for the residents, particularly in very hot areas. The electricity is needed to run the refrigeration systems and so on. That is why that is included. There are a number of very small motels that would also have their own generators&mdash;again for very good reasons. Because they have no other access, they need to be able to provide electricity to service the guests in the motel and also to meet the other needs of the motel. Again the number is very small and the use by motels and the like would be less than the use by private consumers, because of the way in which this has been worded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that there may be some benefit from having a rebate scheme, but we are talking about 5c a litre being reduced here. We are not talking about the whole of the excise on fuel. This is only the 5c a litre increase, which we feel is at this point in time an unreasonable burden on those communities. That is why we proceeded to do it in this way. The administrative cost to the Commonwealth of running a rebate scheme would probably be higher than the cost of going in this fashion. Certainly substantiation and so on by private consumers who are claiming only small amounts would be a little difficult to manage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not rule anything out but what we say to the chamber is that this seems to be, at this point in time, the best way to alleviate an urgent need. That is why we reiterate our request to the Senate for its support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are considerable difficulties with this amendment. As circulated last night, the amendment talked about fuel oil for use in the generation of electricity. That has been corrected. The very fact that the words `fuel oil' appeared in there seems to indicate that the opposition has not got clearly in mind whom it is trying to identify in this group. My understanding is that absolutely no-one in the group the opposition has identified this morning would use fuel oil at all. Some would certainly use industrial diesel fuel, but the fuel oil would probably not even be used in any of the remote larger communities. It would only be used in quite large power stations. One was suspicious that the opposition was trying to address the problems which have been raised in relation to Nabalco and its fuel oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has corrected that to read `industrial diesel fuel for use in the generation of electricity' and then it goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where there is no reasonable access to electricity transmitted from a power station or substation for consumption by commercial or private consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>I have read that amendment without any intonation or stops because it seems to me that is the way it should be read. In other words, the phrase `commercial or private consumers' is qualifying the generation of electricity transmitted from a power station or substation and not the use to which the electricity is actually put. One has to ask the question: at what point does electricity generation become a power station? If two or three houses in a community decide to share the generation of electricity and that is then transmitted from what is in my view a power station to those various homes, it falls outside this definition anyway. Is the opposition simply trying to capture only those farmers who individually generate electricity through the use of diesel fuel? If that is the case, it seems to me that the opposition needs to define the particular group in a rather different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second difficulty I have with this, and I think Senator Margetts has already alluded to it, is that it is precisely in these remote regions, because of the high cost of diesel, that the alternatives are coming on line. I refer to the alternatives that use renewable energy, particularly wind and solar photovoltaics. I remind honourable senators that Australia leads the world in terms of the efficiency of its photovoltaic cells. Because of the high cost of diesel, hybrid schemes are coming in which use part diesel, part photovoltaic systems and so on. That is leading Australia into the wider use of these alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have difficulty with this amendment because it is taking us blindly down a road where we continue to use a fuel which inevitably is running out and which is polluting. If the price is kept artificially low because these other costs are not written into the costs of the diesel fuel, we are simply holding back the inevitable switch which must be made to renewable sources. So I have difficulty with both those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the amendment is still very poorly drawn and does not clearly identify the people to whom the opposition appears to be trying to direct it. Secondly, I think, it moves us in a direction in which we should not be going. We should be going in the other direction, towards the use of renewable sources, particularly in remote regions. If, as Senator Panizza indicated earlier, the opposition is indeed looking towards larger communities, I again remind honourable senators that in Tennant Creek there is currently being built a two-megawatt station, which is a solar thermal station, which avoids the use of industrial diesel altogether. That is the way we should be going in those remote regions. We have a very sunny country and we should be attempting as far as possible to use these alternative sources, not simply going backwards to a continuation of old technology. </PARA>

Having diesel fuel around and transporting it and so on is an enormous difficulty for those concerned. I would love to see a new-tech or low-tech solution to the problem, but none has emerged to date.

The third point I want to make is simply an indication&mdash;not in any way designed to be a criticism&mdash;of the difficulty of trying to amend on the run in this way. There is a view that specifying industrial diesel fuel might not achieve the purpose. Many people in these circumstances might use automotive diesel fuel or automotive diesel oil. I do not want to be too adamant about that, because the amount I know about the practical application of various diesel fuels to generation is very small, but the advice is that there is quite a substantial possibility that in some circumstances people otherwise covered by the amendment might miss out because of the use of the word `industrial' when they might actually be using something else.</PARA></TALK.START>

As I have explained, coastal shipping competes on the long haul and, of course, competes with rail across the continent. We have already removed that from rail, so to remain consistent&mdash;since they are in competition with each other&mdash;it should be removed from seafaring also. I still maintain that it should have been removed from road, but I suppose we must accept any relief we can get for taxpayers and other people around Australia that are affected.

Senator Hill replied, I think, that he is a solicitor and not an industrialist. Perhaps I can fill in for the industrial side of the equation. There is a difference between industrial fuel and automotive fuel, and to my knowledge railway engines use all industrial fuel rather than automotive fuel. Whether it is industrial fuel or automotive fuel, it goes on what is called the cetane number. Automotive fuel used in road vehicles and diesel cars has a high cetane number and the other one, for industrial use, is determined as a low cetane number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diesel engines that are used on road and lighter ones use a higher cetane number because with the smaller cylinders they rely on compression ignition to ignite it. Petrol has octane numbers and it does not immediately ignite, in other words, it ignites when the spark goes through to the cylinder. Diesel relies on the compression. So the industrial diesel fuel is used in the massive engines in the railways and in the ships and in the big power generators. They are all big engines with cylinders that I can stand in compared with the small ones in an automotive situation. That is the difference between industrial and automotive. I think that when we have an excise we should not really differ from one to another because they can virtually be used in the same industry. </PARA>

It is consistent with our overall approach that excise increases are really the last thing that the country can afford at the moment. What we should be looking at is building more competitive industry, not less competitive. The further that government forces up on-costs on business the less competitive Australian industry will be.

That is what these increases are all about.

It might be academic; nevertheless, we ask that it be voted on in those terms. While I am on my feet, I might say to Senator Coulter that higher taxes do not necessarily lead to better services, either. The one thing on which I do agree with Senator Coulter is that services, particularly in the mental health area he mentioned, are unsatisfactory in this country. If, for example, this government had decided to put the $200 million it is putting into a new foreign affairs department building towards mental health services, then I think the nation would have been better off.

<PARA>The cost of this amendment is estimated to be in the vicinity of $1 million. It affects the 26c a litre excise component. The purpose is to exclude the diesel component from the increase in terms of coastal shipping. I believe that the amendment complements the Harradine amendment as far as the coastal shipping side is concerned. The committee agreed to that yesterday when it removed 11(E)(2) and 11(E)(3) from table 2, which related to fuel oil. We are concentrating here on the diesel component. The amendment is designed to remove marine diesel from the table but to retain automotive diesel and industrial diesel in the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a significant amendment because Senator Collins, to his credit, has spent a lot of time in reforming coastal shipping. What did worry us was that, within five days of signing an agreement to bring down the manning levels of Australian coastal ships, the government turned around and put these imposts on coastal shipping. So what we are doing is removing part of that increase in terms of coastal shipping. There is absolutely no incentive there for people to go out and try to bring that level down to less than 18 per ship if the government is going to take all those cost benefits back into its own revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very significant in terms of the message it sends to the shipping people and to the unions about their preparedness to negotiate to bring down the costs of coastal shipping when the government turns around and puts on an excise of this manner which effectively removes all those savings. So this amendment is introduced for consistency with what was done with the Harradine amendment and it is done to acknowledge the special circumstances in relation to the negotiations and what has been signed and achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, within five days of Senator Collins signing that arrangement, the government turned around and put this on.

At least there will be a recognition by the Senate of some of the work Senator Collins has done. I think it is a small price in terms of lost revenue, but the message it sends is important.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to an industrial relations system which recognises that the bargaining power between employees and employers is unequal and the support of a system which establishes and maintains basic standards and protections for employees. That is the position of the federal government, which runs counter to the WA Workplace Agreements Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian bill ostensibly sets up an alternative to the current state award system by providing for individual or collective workplace agreements. The pre-election statements which were made in relation to the bill suggested that employees would be free to remain in the award system if they wished. The reality, as exposed by a number of eminent industrial lawyers, is that employers are free to force employees out of awards and into inferior contracts with diminished conditions and with no redress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disadvantage to employees is further compounded by the absence of any independent body to set minimum conditions of employment. Under other legislation, minimum conditions will be determined by the minister: a minister who has shown that he has little sympathy with workers by the statements he has made frequently; a minister who has plucked the figure of $275, for example, out of the air as a minimum weekly wage with no flexibility about it. That minimum weekly wage would apply to anybody in a rural area; it would apply to somebody living in Karratha just as it would to somebody living in Perth. It is a ridiculous concept with no flexibility and no understanding of what it actually costs to live these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professional opinion and an informed reading of the legislation shows clearly that the apparent protections contained in the proposed bill are illusory; they will not provide the protection they appear to. Let me give some practical examples. Where, for example, a prospective employee's work is covered already by an award&mdash;that is, the area in which that person works is covered by an award under state law&mdash;the employer can offer the job on the basis that wages and conditions will be those set out in a workplace agreement. It is the concept of take it or leave it&mdash;the contract or the job. The second example is where an employee is already on a contract&mdash;they are starting to become known in Western Australia as Kierath contracts or Court contracts&mdash;and that is up for renewal, an employer can ask the employee to accept inferior conditions in the new contract and can threaten dismissal for refusal to sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apparent protections&mdash;the protection against intimidation under section 66 of the act and the prohibition of dismissal for refusing to sign it under section 68 of the act&mdash;are overridden by section 71 which provides exceptions to sections 66 and 68. It provides employer immunity from those clauses via sections 73 and 75. In other words, the threat of dismissal or notice of dismissal following an employee's refusal to sign a contract on terms laid down by the employer does not give rise to any right on behalf of the employee to pursue a case for unfair dismissal. The employee is forced to sign or resign or be sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal opinion also states that the bill would allow the employer to sack award employees and refuse to re-hire them unless they are prepared to sign a Kierath contract on inferior terms. It is not just an oversight that employers have these powers. It is not just an oversight that the bill is dressed up to look fair even though, as I have already pointed out, the fair parts of it are undermined by other parts that are manifestly unfair. It is a thin veil deliberately placed over the vicious intent of the bill. Neither of these things are oversights because the bill was prepared in consultation with leading anti-employee solicitors&mdash;union-busters&mdash;and the WA Chamber of Commerce. It is an employer instrument designed to reverse the long history of protections enjoyed under Australia's unique and fair award system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just me saying this. There are far more eminent and more knowledgeable people than me and, in a sense, less biased people than me. I quote from a joint opinion by Rene Le Miere and Ian Viner. Ian Viner was a minister in the former Liberal government. He was minister for industrial relations at one time. I quote from the summary of that opinion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We answer the questions asked of us as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The legislation does not protect prospective employees who wish to be employed pursuant to an award rather than a workplace agreement in circumstances where the prospective employer requires that they enter into a workplace agreement as a precondition to employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The legislation does not protect employees who have entered into workplace agreements in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept less favourable terms and conditions of employment in a new workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The legislation does not protect employees in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept the terms and conditions of employment in a workplace agreement proposed by the employer, except in the situation where an employer has not previously entered into a workplace agreement. Whether the employee is actually protected will depend upon the particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The legislation does not protect employees if their employer dismisses all its workforce by notice, advertises their jobs and then employs only those persons, including the former employees, who are willing to enter into a workplace agreement on the terms and conditions specified by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is, as I said, from an opinion by Ian Viner QC, and Rene Le Miere&mdash;Ian Viner being the minister for industrial relations in a former Liberal government. The bill is disgraceful in my opinion and a denial of basic industrial rights. I believe also, and this has not been tested yet, that it is a contravention of International Labour Organisation conventions which have been ratified by this country and by the state of Western Australia itself. In contrast, the proposed Commonwealth legislation will protect employees who do not have access to independent tribunals or who have no redress against unfair dismissals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state minister has proceeded with legislation in the full knowledge that it will be overruled by the Commonwealth. This is a good thing for workers, of course, because they will get the protection, denied to them in the state act, under Commonwealth law. But it makes the exercise in Western Australia a cynical exercise. There is no rational basis for the legislation. The whole thing is ideologically driven by the Court government in consultation with union busting lawyers and WA Chamber of Commerce zealots. It does no credit to any of them. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Ian, the great universities of Oxford and Cambridge, their student unions or guilds were really . . . they were the basis of those universities in some respects, and why try and do away with that? I mean, the university vice-chancellors also hold that view . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I argued with Ron on the radio. Since that interview I have found out from my friends in the Adam Smith Institute in London and from contacts in the United Kingdom government that the secretary for education in Great Britain is introducing student reforms in England which will ensure for the first time in hundreds of years in Great Britain that our friends in Great Britain will have the same freedoms as Norman Moore, the Minister for Education, is hoping to allow the students of Western Australia to enjoy. So the student bodies at those great universities of Oxford and Cambridge will, in a short time, enjoy the same freedoms as the students at campuses in Western Australia will enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to read a summary of the government's proposals for the reform of student unions in Great Britain. There is a similarity to the objectives of and motivations for introducing voluntary student unionism in Western Australia. Let me quote briefly from a July 1993 summary paper from the Department of Education in London. One of the motivations which is specifically put forward is `to avoid public funds being used for affiliations to external organisations such as the NUS'. Great Britain is blighted with its own NUS, I understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter which I will refer to in the debate on states grants. One of the problems we will face if we have public funding of student unions, which Mr Dawkins and Mr Beazley have now put into legislation, is that we will see taxpayers' money going to fund bodies like the NUS but the taxpayers will have no choice as to how those funds are spent. That is something we need to avoid. This is why, when the states grants legislation comes before the Senate, we will be trying to convince the Australian Democrats that we should avoid the situation occurring where taxpayers' money will be given to organisations like the National Union of Students without the taxpayers having any control over how that money is spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to one other point made in this British government document. Point 3 of the objective of the act states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reform package means that all students will for the first time be able to choose whether they wish to be aligned with their campus union's activities outside the core.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a crucial thing. Students across the globe should have the freedom to decide whether or not to join a student union. That is an objective that the Western Australian government shares and an objective which is very much at the core of the federal opposition's philosophical basis and part of its policy for the 1993 election and, I am sure, for the 1996 election or any election before that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another initiative of John Major's United Kingdom government which also seeks to enhance students' rights and which is very similar in intent to the reforms being proposed by the Hon. Norman Moore, the Minister for Education in Western Australia. That is the document published by the Adam Smith Institute in London called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Students' Charter</EMPHASIS>. It is a part of the citizens' charter initiatives of the United Kingdom government which seeks to guarantee to the consumers of government services some minimum rights and minimum expectations when they go to receive a government service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting initiative which is being pursued in the United Kingdom and which I have a specific interest in because I think it has great application to government service in Australia, where many taxpayers go to government departments and get shoddy service. There are many government departments which will give good service, but there are many citizens, I am sure, who have gone to government departments from time to time, be they federal or state government departments, and received shoddy service; and they feel betrayed as taxpayers, having paid good money to government only to see the services delivered in a shoddy manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the United Kingdom government has set out to do is to create a charter of consumers' rights for those who consume government services. One of the charters that has now been published&mdash;and it has been published by the Adam Smith Institute in particular in this case&mdash;is a charter for students which sets out the sorts of rights that students should be able to expect when they go to a university or a tertiary institution. Under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Students' Charter</EMPHASIS>, again student unions are referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What hit me when I read this charter was the incredible similarity in the objectives of trying to make student unions voluntary. On page 6 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Students' Charter</EMPHASIS> document, authored by Peter Yorke, Mr Yorke says that student unions play a significant role in campus life at UK universities and colleges&mdash;again agreeing with the former member for Stirling, Ron Edwards, in that respect. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many places they are responsible for the running of the student bar and the welfare of students. The provision of these services is laudable and shows what they are capable of.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is the situation on university campuses in Western Australia. The guilds, the student unions, provide many services, some of which are essential, some of which are not so essential, but all of which provide good services to students. Indeed, we argue that, when student union membership is made voluntary, many of those services will absolutely flourish because they will become more responsive to the needs of the individual members and the student unions will have to work a lot harder to ensure that the service provided is good, that they attract membership and that, indeed, the membership is not just given to them of right and they just do not receive the fees, or receive the memberships, without having to work to achieve them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Yorke, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Students' Charter</EMPHASIS> document, goes on to talk about the problems of compulsion. One of the problems referred to, of course, is what he calls the `unnatural swelling of the National Union of Students funds'. That is one of the problems we have in Australia. People are compulsorily required to join student unions and, therefore, pay a compulsory fee to the National Union of Students on those many campuses where they are affiliated to the National Union of Students. That is unnatural because the National Union of Students ends up with a treasury of funds from students who may not necessarily want their money to go to the National Union of Students. They may not, in fact, want their money to go to any student union at all. They have no choice in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other problem, which I have already referred to, is the closed shop. I quote again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the closed shop causes the union to fall too readily into the hands of a small number of extremists. As most of those compelled to join a student union have no interest in politics, the likelihood is that they will take no part in the way things are run and take no interest in the decisions made by the controlling group.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that that is the case on campuses around Australia. Whenever there is a referendum on affiliation issues or things like that, there are extremely small voter turnouts. A hell of a lot of students go to university just with the objective of&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;being educated. Some of us go to campuses and are interested in taking part in student political activities, and that is tremendous to see. The more people get involved in student political activities, the better for politics in Australia and the better for education, I believe. The point at issue, of course, is whether or not these student unions should be funded by those who wish not to be members; and that is most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude my contribution with a quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wealth of Nations</EMPHASIS> by Adam Smith, of course, where he refers to another instance where the funding of a body is remote from the performance. Specifically, I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The endowments of schools and colleges have necessarily diminished more or less the necessity of application in the teachers. Their subsistence, so far as it arises from their salaries, is evidently derived from a fund altogether independent of their success and reputation in their particular professions.</PARA>
<PARA>The importance of that principle, espoused by the great economist and philosopher, is that, where the derivation of a body's funds does not depend on the performance of that body, then the performance will not be what it should be. It is the opposition's argument&mdash;this relates to either a student union or a trade union&mdash;that the funding needs to reflect the performance of the union, and of the management and the office bearers of that union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the union can rely on the same funding year in year out, regardless of performance, it will not be motivated in the correct way. That is the opposition's argument. We will be pursuing that argument in relation to the states grants bill, which comes before the Senate next week. I certainly hope that we are able to use these sorts of arguments to convince our friends and colleagues in the Democrats to support the view that Commonwealth taxpayers' money should not be channelled into student unions in this way. In the end, it will ensure those student unions become unrepresentative, and bureaucratic, and that they do not have the proper incentives required to ensure that they represent the students. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my grave concerns about the upheaval and trauma which have been visited on the remote South Australian town of Woomera in recent months. The drama now being played out at Woomera is a litany of retrenchments, of wage cuts, of workers being stripped of their accrued benefits and effectively evicted from their homes. The effect on the town has been devastating. Morale and community spirit have plummeted. Families have broken up and others have been strained to breaking point. Children have been forced out of school mid-term as their families join the exodus of up to 300 people from the town. All of this may sound melodramatic, but it is an accurate picture of what has been going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited Woomera on 22 and 23 September to see for myself. I spoke to workers, to union officials, to the town doctor and to the chief Defence employee. For hours I listened to the grievances of people whose lives have been torn asunder. The anger was so strong you could almost touch it. Woomera is a defence town. It exists for virtually no other reason than to service the US/Australian base at Nurrungar. All jobs at Woomera are directly or indirectly funded by our Department of Defence and the United States Air Force. Almost all housing is owned by Defence, and to lose your job in Woomera means losing your home. So you get hit with a double whammy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The citizens of Woomera have vastly fewer democratic and economic rights than other Australians. There is no local council, like most Australian communities have. The Area Administrator Woomera, who heads up the Defence Support Centre at Woomera, runs the town with the powers of a feudal landlord. He has extraordinary control of peoples' lives and livelihoods, and he cannot be voted out of office. In Woomera, town services which would normally be provided by a local council are instead supplied by private contractors and the Defence Support Centre Woomera. This is where the current saga begins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last 17 years, the private contractor has been basically the same firm, which now goes under the name of SERCo. Its most recent contract expired on 30 September. Tenders were called before that date for the new contract that began on 1 October. The range of services to be provided under the new contract was expanded under the commercial support program. In other words, some services previously supplied by Defence were commercialised. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want, however, to contradict claims made by Senator Ray when I recently asked a question on this subject. The Democrats do not object to cost reductions through improved work practices, nor are we opposed to the commercialisation of selected defence functions. What we do object to is the callous way it was done at Woomera. The contract handover has been a classic example of how not to implement change. It is a saga of grossly insensitive management, serious conflict of interest and a repudiation of the industrial relations principles which this government claims to stand for. I am not going to give all the details here&mdash;I have supplied quite substantial details to Senator Ray and I believe he will respond to those in due course&mdash;but I do want to outline the main problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence Support Centre Woomera has had an unacceptable conflict of interest in this affair. On the one hand, it monitored the old contract and drew up the requirements for the new one, in its role as town administrator. On the other hand, it bid for and won parts of the contract. It does not take a genius to realise that DSCW was in a hopelessly compromised position. It could not and did not impartially administer the previous contract, when it had a commercial interest in containing costs under the new contract. The information passed to DSCW in its role as town administrator gave it a commercial head start in bidding for the new contract. Evidence that I was given suggests strongly that DSCW won a transport contract in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major problem is the way in which workers in the town have been stripped of pay and conditions by the use of a loophole in the Industrial Relations Act. The villain of the piece in this case was not DSCW but Australian Defence Industries. As part of its successful bid for major parts of the new contract, ADI concluded a so-called greenfields agreement with the minority union at Woomera, the Federation of Industrial Manufacturing and Engineering Employees Union. By calling it a greenfields agreement, ADI escaped the no disadvantage test for certified agreements, which would have ensured that workers were no worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major union at Woomera, the AMEU, was totally excluded from this agreement. Even local FIMEE officials were not properly consulted, and the agreement was signed despite their opposition to it. If this is how enterprise bargaining is done, Australian workers have a lot to worry about. At Woomera there was no bargaining and no agreement with the workers. Cuts in pay and conditions were imposed, and workers were told to take it or leave it. In some cases, disposable income was cut by up to $12,000. The fiction peddled by ADI&mdash;that this was a greenfields site&mdash;is now the subject of an appeal to the Industrial Relations Commission. I hope that the commission is able to see through ADI's argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a government authority imposing negative cost cutting on workers, many of whom will have to do more work for less pay. Negative cost cutting is a practice that this government claims to oppose, yet it has done nothing to stop it from being carried out at Woomera. The award safety net so beloved of the industrial relations minister has a huge hole in it, through which the workers of Woomera have been dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former employees of the previous contractor, Serco, have been hit particularly hard by the contract handover. Former Serco workers continuing with ADI&mdash;in some cases on lower pay&mdash;will not be allowed to take their accrued benefits with them, nor will those benefits be paid out through a redundancy package. Again, they have been failed by the so-called award safety net. This government has announced that it will legislate for greater fairness in the termination of employment, yet a clear case of unfairness has been allowed to occur without the government raising a finger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has made it clear that the issue of accrued benefits and redundancy pay for continuing workers is a matter for Serco and ADI, but the fact is that the people who will lose out through this stand-off are the workers, not the companies. It is the government's responsibility to insist that this matter be resolved fairly. As I said before, Woomera is a Defence town, and Defence has never been shy about influencing the conditions of Serco workers. So it cannot just wash its hands of the whole affair and leave the workers of Woomera in the lurch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The redundancy issue is also before the Industrial Relations Commission, but that should not stop the government acting to rectify a clear-cut case of unfairness. It is my view that the minister's hands-off approach to the dire situation at Woomera is inappropriate; and I must express my disappointment at the answer he gave on Tuesday to my question on notice on this subject. I appreciate that the minister cannot get involved in every case of shonky management and worker exploitation. There are other ways of dealing, however, with isolated cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the situation at Woomera is not a small or isolated case. It has had an impact on the entire town and it is too serious to ignore. The minister, surely, has an interest in repairing morale at a facility that he claims is vital to our security. It must be appreciated that no-one is directly accountable to the people of Woomera. The Area Administrator, Woomera, and his Defence Support Centre Woomera, cannot be voted out of office by the people whose lives have been torn apart by this contract handover. The person to whom the DSCW is ultimately accountable is the minister. If he refuses to help the people of Woomera, then DSCW is accountable to no-one. That is why I urge the minister to act. In the interests of fairness, morale and good management, his intervention is overdue. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FY5">Senator DENMAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to a matter of public interest in my home state of Tasmania. I want to highlight the very serious consequences to Tasmania if the jobs of 800 teachers, health workers, librarians and other public sector employees are axed as part of the Groom government's budget strategy. As a result of the reduction in these services, there will be disastrous long-term effects for Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my aim today to focus specifically on education cuts. But before I do, I feel it is important that I expose how unnecessary the overall cuts are in light of the budget forecasts for the state. It is, therefore, necessary to look briefly at the situation in terms of the state's net debt servicing ratio taken over by the Field government during the 1990s, which was irresponsibly left by the Gray government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania had, indeed, reached a crisis point at that time. State debt had to be confronted. The cost of servicing the debt needed to be reduced as a percentage of the annual budget. Without any action, it was forecast, the debt ratio would have blown out to a staggering 30 per cent by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the strategy adopted by the then Field government reversed that trend, ensuring that the debt ratio would peak at 12.5 per cent and drop back to 10 per cent by the year 2000. I am the first to admit that a series of very unpopular steps was taken at that time, including significant cuts to the public sector. The Field government was left with little or no choice. The state was going broke, and the facts have been well documented with commentators and economists agreeing that the steps taken were necessary and well thought out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term, that contributed to the defeat of the Field government. The point is that the measures taken, together with various other factors, including lower interest rates and federal funding, have reduced the state debt ratio to 10.3 per cent. That figure will continue to drop to a forecast 9.7 per cent and will continue down. There is no good or sound need to further cut the public sector in Tasmania. We have the highest unemployment rate in the country, with 28,000 Tasmanians seeking employment. It must be remembered that Mr Groom campaigned very strongly on jobs, jobs, jobs, no redundancy schemes and maintaining funding to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian public has been shattered by his duplicity. Nineteen months after the election, we have higher unemployment, lower business confidence and a growing crisis in the community. The polls accurately reflect this. It really is a case of higher unemployment and fewer services. Despite this, the Groom government is attempting to cut 166.5 teachers out of the school system. I doubt seriously whether the government has any idea of the devastating impact its decision will have. My background is in teaching. I am very aware of the difficulties and stresses teachers face. I am also aware of the reduced quality of education as a result of reducing staffing. It is inconceivable to me that a government would cut teachers from a system already reduced to a minimum to save $2.8 million in 1993-94. This is less than one per cent of the education budget, and the community is screaming out for the quality of education they have paid for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Education has described the cuts as marginal, but in my view they are literally the final straw. Many schools are being forced into making untenable decisions about dropping special education, music, art, physical education and library time. These cuts lead also to increased class sizes, decreased curriculum diversity, and fewer subject choices for students who are looking to specialise in years 7 to 12. I would like to read from a newsletter that went to parents of children attending a primary school in Tasmania. The principal said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our school is to be badly affected by the State government decision to cut 166.5 teachers in 1993-1994 state budget. Our school's staff and school council have not yet finalised the school plan for 1994, however I feel that it is important that parents realise the most likely impact of the cuts. They are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.57% less senior teacher time which will reduce the direct supervision and support for class teachers and children and cut or reduce several special programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Support reading for grades 5 and 6 will go.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Support reading for middle primary classes will be reduced by 25%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The home assisted reading program will need to be reduced from 3 to 1 session per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.Curriculum development work will get less support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.There will be 25% less time for Music.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.40% less time for PhysEd will mean that no PE teacher involvement in the Inter School sport program for Grades 5 and 6.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an example of one primary school's predicament. Senior and secondary schools and colleges face even tougher times. The tragedy is, of course, that there is no need to go ahead with cuts, and that is the point I want to emphasise. It is obviously the belief of Mr Groom and his government that there is no real need to give as much support as possible to our teaching institution and staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High unemployment and the recession are hurting our urban and rural communities. Young families with school-aged children are the first to feel the brunt. An example of this is the dramatic rise in school loan issues which are means tested on student families. Loan issues have risen from 23 per cent of students in 1991 to 35 per cent in 1993. That is a frightening indication of some of the underlying problems schools face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Teaching staff are often the first point of call for families in crisis with the strain of unemployment and reduced income. Schools are having to commit significant resources for counselling parents and students. They are becoming a social clearing house. Stress for teachers becomes a factor as a result. It shocked me to find that in the years between 1989 and 1993 there were 58 stress-related retirements of teachers across Tasmania. That gives an indication of the stress-related problems teachers now have. How much worse does it have to get before some relief is given? Staff reductions force up class sizes; large class sizes mean less time for teachers to give to individual students. In the meantime, the workload for teachers goes up, quality education goes down, and the social problems are compounded. We can see why over 1,000 teachers, students and parents marched through the streets of Hobart recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish by making a couple of points. The first one relates to students currently completing diplomas within our state university. The forecast reductions mean that no graduates will be recruited into the school system for at least the next two years and only very few from that point on. The average age of teaching staff throughout Tasmania is 41 years. A large block of teachers started in the 1970s, and in 15 years time at least 15 per cent of those staff will have retired. Without an influx of new graduates each year, a large hole in terms of experience will appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is this: teachers in Tasmania recently received a salary rise. The state government almost immediately announced a significant tax increase&mdash;in particular, tobacco tax&mdash;to compensate for the rise. It had, incidentally, been comprehensively beaten on the argument run in the industrial commission claiming incapacity to pay for the teachers' increase, which says something in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury estimate for the additional tobacco tax was an extra $21 million on top of the $34 million, assuming a drop in consumption of 20 per cent. The budget papers reveal annual receipts of $40 million and predict a revenue increase of $17 million. The teachers' pay increase, unveiled as part of the budget papers, is $15.5 million. So I ask: why on earth cut the teaching service by four per cent?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I wish to raise three issues with the Senate. The first concerns the regulation of private pension developments in the UK and Australia. I rise to inform the Senate that the Goode committee in the United Kingdom has handed down its report on the regulation of pensions. It was an important event because it provides a reference point to compare and contrast recent events in Australia. It is therefore worthy of special report to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goode report was prepared in the wake of the Maxwell scandal, where close to $A800 million was stolen from the Maxwell pension fund, thereby adversely affecting the retirement security of thousands of employees and retirees. Some commentators have said that the loss of funds was just, to use their words, `a drop in the ocean'. My colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and I believe otherwise. It has made many Australian people think again about the security of pension funds. For many Australians, it is their only form of saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Goode report is instructive for a number of reasons. First, as the Australian private pension system evolved out of the British system, the trustee structure, which is the foundation for the management of pension funds, is a common feature in both countries. Interestingly, Goode recommends that the basic structure remain. The SIS bills package, to be debated shortly in the parliament, also upholds the trust structure but takes it out of the hands of the law of equity and clearly spells out the duties of trustees. Professor Goode has recommended that there be a single regulator of superannuation assets. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, under the chairmanship of Senator Sherry, made a similar recommendation 16 months previously in its first report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Super</EMPHASIS>. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the SIS bills have taken up the single regulator idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Goode recommends that fund members have the right to appoint at least one-third of the trustees. The select committee recommended that there be equal employer-employee representation. This, I believe, is a surer means of safeguarding super assets. Again I can report that the SIS bills also include equal representation. Having regard to the imbalance of trustee representation that may exist in the United Kingdom, it may have been appropriate for there to be a recommendation that a custodian be appointed to hold the fund assets. In that way, future Maxwells would be thwarted in their attempts to seize fund assets. As I understand it, Professor Goode has not recommended that custodians assume such a role. I hope that he takes on board the comments I am making here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, pension funds should be fully funded&mdash;except for public sector funds, of course&mdash;whereas in the UK and the US there exists a degree of underfunding of employer contributions. Should an employer sponsoring a superannuation plan become insolvent, there is therefore the chance that employees can be short-changed and not receive their full entitlements. The Goode report recommends that funds meet a 90 per cent minimum solvency standard and that it be monitored by the actuary, the auditor and the regulator. Essentially, the SIS bills accord with this recommendation, with the exception that full funding should occur. Under SIS it will be the job of actuaries, auditors and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to keep an ever-watchful eye on the adequacy of fund assets relative to pension liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most striking similarity between the Goode report and the SIS bills is the notion that, in the event of fund failure through fraud or dishonesty, there be a retrospective levy on all funds to make good any losses. Senator Sherry, the previous chair of the superannuation committee, was a champion of this approach to secure pension assets, and I am sure that he will be interested to hear that the UK is on the threshold of embracing it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that this speech has assisted honourable senators in understanding some of the complexities of regulating pension funds. The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has spent considerable time and effort in coming to grips with the superannuation industry supervision package of bills which will greatly assist in placing a security blanket over the $170 billion in pension assets. I expect that the committee will hand down a detailed report on the SIS bills late next week, and then the Senate will be able to debate those bills in an informed and thereby effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the past fortnight, the committee has conducted a number of public meetings on the bills and, in a departure from its previous modus operandi of examining legislation, it has convened informal meetings with the Insurance and Superannuation Commission on a number of occasions to clarify certain matters. I have found these to be a highly productive exercise. I commend the minister, Senator McMullan, and the parliamentary secretary, Gary Johns, who both have responsibility for Insurance and Superannuation Commission matters and I thank them for their assistance in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to raise today concerns an issue that arose during the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration involving technical aspects of tax law. Officers from the Australian Taxation Office gave their view as to the scope of work related counselling. The section at issue was section 58M of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act, which exempts from tax work related counselling. Section 136 defines work related counselling as counselling which is to improve or maintain the quality of the performance of employees' duties, or prepare employees for retirement, and which relates to any of the following: safety, health, fitness, stress management, personal relationships, retirement problems, drug and alcohol abuse, rehabilitation or prevention of work related trauma, or other diseases or injury, first aid and any similar matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Robert Richards, a well-respected tax practitioner and a regular contributor to several professional journals, is concerned about two issues. He has asked that his position be placed on the public record. Mr Richards's view is that outplacement counselling does not fit into any of these categories, as it is essentially about assisting in finding a job and in writing resumes. Mr Richards was also concerned about the manner of the response and is of the belief that the response from the tax office impinges on his professional reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Mr Richards believed that the answer given by the tax office was wrong, in that it represents the Australian Taxation Office view of the law rather than, as he put it, the technically correct position. I refer all those who read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to the proceedings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in terms of the technical aspects of taxation law. I hope they will be aware of this contribution so that Mr Richards's standing among his peers is not diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity of calling on the government to introduce, by way of legislation, the amendments necessary to clarify its intent as expressed through its taxation officers. The government should ensure that its view of the law is expressed correctly through legislation, so that the practice adopted by the tax office is technically correct. This will require an amendment to tax law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on behalf of the opposition in relation to the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 and the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. The opposition supports both bills, noting the amendment to be moved by the government to the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to four acts. There are four key proposals. The first relates to the Timor Gap and the Australian Customs Service barrier control and enforcement in that area; the second is in relation to ship arrival reports and the details of possessions of crews; the third concerns the clarification of the rules of the origin of preferential goods; and the fourth and most significant for the purpose of this debate is for the anti-dumping arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the opposition does not oppose this bill now that section 23 of the original legislation, which deals with the availability of reports of the Anti-Dumping Authority, is going to be removed by the government by way of amendment. At present, reports from the Anti-Dumping Authority are available to the public as soon as practicable, after presentation to the minister, but before ministerial decision. The government's original proposal in this bill was that those reports would be publicly available only after the minister had made his decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government put an argument that the existing arrangements put too much pressure on the minister to consider arguments or recommendations before making his decision and thus duplicating the work of the ADA. The opposition and the Democrats reaction to that was, `Well, so what?'. We did not support that proposition. We believe that interested groups should be able to put their case to the minister after the report is released but before the minister makes a decision. We also believe that, under the changes originally proposed by the government, it was possible for the minister to sit on the report and that dumping could potentially continue. That would have set a very bad precedent. We are pleased that the government has accepted the case put by the opposition and the Democrats that that particular amendment should not proceed. Therefore, with the amendment to delete that section, the opposition supports the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill is a bill to amend a number of bounty acts and, again, the opposition supports this bill. I wish to address a few remarks to it because it is a significant matter. The bill is significant because it represents the implementation of the recommendations of the Industry Commission report on book production, released in October 1992. The opposition would like to congratulate the government on accepting all of the recommendations of this Industry Commission report. Indeed, we look forward with great anticipation to the government accepting future recommendations from the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, we would welcome the government adopting the latest Industry Commission report on impediments to regional industry adjustment. Unfortunately, the government has made noises antipathetic to that particular report, which is very regrettable. That report calls for much greater labour market flexibility to enhance employment opportunities in regional Australia but, unfortunately, the Labor Party's union bosses have said, `No way, Jose'. That report will obviously be shelved, and that is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission report on book production and this bill acknowledge the need for orderly reduction in assistance to book producers. The opposition supports orderly progressive reduction in protection, either by tariff or by way of bounty. The issue here is that taxpayers should not have to continue subsidising book production or subsidising any other forms of production any longer than absolutely necessary. We are talking about not insignificant sums of money in this area. The proposition involved in this bill is that there will be an expenditure of some $55 million over the next four years to subsidise book production. That is a not an insignificant amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, from our perspective, it is only necessary to continue subsidising book production because of government imposed costs on book producers. Book producers, like most other businesses in this country, are suffering from the lack of action on economic reform by this government. There is absolutely no evidence of any sense of urgency by this government in relation to economic reform. We continue to have a gross foreign debt of over $200 billion; a net debt of some $170 billion; and unemployment stuck at between 10 and 11 per cent. However, no sense of urgency is demonstrated by this government to take the measures necessary to solve those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have debated at length the fact that the 1993-94 budget does nothing to address those economic problems. The tax system that this country is lumbered with does nothing to address those problems. Book producers, like most other businesses in this country, find it extremely hard to be internationally competitive. Businesses are faced with federal government taxes and charges, and state taxes and charges. Other issues, such as the super levy, the training guarantee levy, and payroll taxes, et cetera, make it extremely difficult for businesses to be internationally competitive. Hence, we find we have to subsidise book production in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one major area of reform where the government could move&mdash;industrial relations&mdash;we are about to be presented with legislation which again demonstrates that this government has no idea of what is required to be done to make Australian businesses internationally competitive and able to employ more Australians. In this context, I refer the Senate to the report of the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, which was prepared by Fred Argy, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A long term economic strategy for Australia</EMPHASIS>. Argy is a former director of the government's Economic Planning Advisory Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among that distinguished gentleman's recommendations to the government through this CEDA report were four very critical ones which I think are relevant to this issue. Argy recommended that governments need to adopt a more productive, pro-active, even aggressive role in addressing Australia's competitive weakness, especially in facilitating trade related activities and investments. Secondly, he recommended that industrial relations reforms need to be adopted which markedly enhance workplace and structural wage flexibility. Thirdly, business regulations that impede employment, competitiveness and investment must be exposed to much more critical evaluation. Fourthly, and probably most importantly, the tax system must be restructured so as to facilitate growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reasonable for the opposition to ask in relation to this bill where the government is on those four essential issues. We see no evidence of real tax reform; we see no real evidence of industrial relations reform, to the detriment not only of book producers but also of most other businesses in this country. What we are really saying is that the bounty arrangements in this bill which the Industry Commission has recommended to the government and which it is adopting are necessary, from our point of view, but only because of the government's inaction on the question of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not oppose the bill, but we call on the government to get on with an aggressive program of economic reform so that book producers can be competitive. I conclude my remarks on behalf of the opposition by quoting from that Industry Commission report which this government has accepted and which I hope it will note. As the Industry Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improvements in competitiveness are needed if the industry is to prosper in the future. With gradual reduction of the cost burdens imposed by the existing tariff structure in Australia, the main opportunities for future advance seems likely to lie in the general areas of management and work practice. For example, the industry (both employers and unions/employees) might usefully direct attention to the relationship between the level of utilisation of capital equipment and other conditions of employment presently incorporated in relevant industry awards. Improved flexibility in these aspects would bring benefits to the book production industry, and to the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. This is an omnibus bill which seeks to make a number of amendments relating to rules of origin, increasing the customs reach of Australian authorities to the Timor Gap, and the publication of Anti-Dumping Authority reports. The rules of origin are clarified for deciding where tariff preferences actually apply. The Australian Democrats certainly support the provisions contained in this bill for this purpose. However, that we express the hope that this clarification of the origin of product also will be transferred into Australian laws regarding labelling and packaging. We would expect that the current very unsatisfactory situation, which does not clearly show whether the goods have been totally produced in Australia from Australian products or whether they have simply been assembled here from imported products, does a lot of damage to Australian industry. I am looking forward to the Australian government taking appropriate action to improve our labelling provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments in this bill relate to the extension of customs controls to the oil rig platforms in the Timor Gap. In itself, this is a measure that the Australian Democrats support. However, it should be noted in this context that the Australian Democrats were the only party to oppose the conclusion of the Timor Gap oil treaty with Indonesia on the basis that this in effect is the 30 pieces of silver that we are collecting for the betrayal of the East Timorese. This position the Australian Democrats have adopted consistently remains. I simply remark that this provision continues the implementation of the collection of the blood money that we have earned over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the last segment of the bill, which relates to the publication of Anti-Dumping Authority reports. At the moment it is provided that such reports, when they are handed to the minister, should also as soon as practicable be provided to the public. That includes those people who have made an application for anti-dumping and countervailing provisions. The amendment that the government seeks to bring in is to legalise the practice which now obtains where these reports are provided to the public usually after the minister has received them and very often, and more importantly, after the minister has made a determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that, once the minister has made a determination, that determination can be overcome only by court action. It is also clear and on the record that very often reports from the Anti-Dumping Authority have contained factual errors and a line of argument which the Australian manufacturers seeking protection from the dumping of cheap imports on our markets have sought to rectify and bring to the minister's notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats drafted an amendment to ensure that these reports are provided to the public at the same time as the minister receives them. To the opposition's shame, its members have rejected this amendment. They have not offered support for a measure which would have given Australian manufacturers the chance to have a greater influence on anti-dumping measures. Clearly, the government would not have supported it either. However, I do acknowledge that the government has done the next best thing and has decided by amendment to withdraw that provision. We are now returning to the prior bill situation where the authority is obliged to provide to the public the report as soon as practicable after the minister receives it. I call on the minister to give instructions that this be done, indeed as soon as practicable, but certainly before the minister makes his determination, to enable the industry to have some influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill and simply note that, in the case of both the book bounty and the computer bounty provisions, the rates are reduced but they are reduced after consultation with industry. To the Australian Democrats, this is the most hopeful sign, namely, that the government has decided that it is necessary in each industry to proceed with such legislation in consultation with and with the agreement of industry. The Australian Democrats will support both bills. </PARA>

It will need to be at a treaty level and it will need to cover such issues as indemnity for Australia for any damages. We believe those issues can be dealt with by February.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Health. I draw the minister's attention to the fact that one in five Australians suffers some form of mental illness at some stage in his or her life and that around 30 per cent of all hospital beds are occupied by people with mental illnesses. I also draw his attention to the link between dysfunctional families and mental health problems, confirmed in the Burdekin report, and to the facts that 40,000 marriages end each year, that youth suicide is now the No. 1 killer of young men aged 18 to 24, and that the number of homeless people is around 40,000. Why, after more than 10 years, has this government, in its areas of responsibility, not given a higher priority to a national strategy with sufficient resources to minimise family breakdown, thereby helping to prevent mental health problems? Finally, given that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Australia ratified in 1980, and other relevant international instruments are incorporated in the Commonwealth Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986, why is this government in breach of its own legislation in relation to the human rights of Australia's mentally ill?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I might manage it. Even without Senator Vanstone's assistance, I could just about do it. When one reads the Burdekin report and looks at the scope of its recommendations and findings one realises how great the problem is and how much is being done and, I suppose, how little is being done in other areas. To then try to apportion blame to any particular place is, to my mind, difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last April I got the states to agree for the first time in our 90-odd years of federation to have a national health policy. Obviously, when managing any form of mental illness or anything else, it is difficult to have a coordinated national approach when six states and two territories are running a hospital system and, by and large, being responsible for the organisations that deliver community care. Therefore, the tone of Senator Newman's question&mdash;that in some way the Burdekin report reveals some massive failure on the part of the federal government&mdash;is quite extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Burdekin inquiry began, which was in June 1990, mental health services were the responsibility of state and territory governments. The federal government had no direct role at all&mdash;none. Fortunately, because of the tenure of my predecessor, Brian Howe, that was turned around. A landmark agreement for a five-year national mental health strategy was reached in March 1992 between the federal government and the states. That strategy involves expenditure from the Commonwealth of $135 million to assist the states in building stronger networks of community care. That seems to me to be an excellent start, but I would not suggest for a second that it is the end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, from listening to the comments this morning of state ministers around the country of both political persuasions, there remains much more to be done.

I do not regard the Commonwealth government as being responsible for family breakdown. Any suggestion of the same is, of course, a nonsense. There is certainly an increase in the rate of family breakdown occurring in Australia at the moment, so much so that I am told that, within only two decades, the most common family will be a family where one or both partners is marrying or partnering for the second time. That changes the concept we have always had of what families are. So there is a change going on in society to which we must react. Whether that means that that is, in some way, the sole cause, as Senator Newman seems to suggest, of mental illness is not only debatable but a nonsense. What I intend to do is continue to make sure that sufficient resources are put in place to sort that situation out.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer the minister to the article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> headed `Women's own health department?' which arises from findings of the evaluation of the national women's health program.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I released the evaluation report of the national women's health program. That does in fact make reference to the establishment of a separate branch devoted entirely to women's health. It does not make reference to the establishment of a women's health department. So, to that extent, the report is not quite accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to tell the Senate about the report. The evaluation of the national women's health program occurs as the program has come to the end of its first four years. One of its recommendations is for that program to continue for another four or even eight years. I am happy to say that we pre-empted the report in our budget by funding the program to $30 million for another four years. That $30 million is actually almost double the funding that was given to the first four years of the program, which was $16 million. What is also important is that it is a matched dollar for dollar program from the Commonwealth to the state, so the Commonwealth commitment of $30 million means that there will be $60 million available over the next four years to devote to continuing women's health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Richardson referred a moment ago to getting a national agreement between the Commonwealth and the states for a national health program at the recent Commonwealth-state health ministers conference. We were also supported by the states in their commitment to another four-year continuation of the national women's health program. So, in fact, we have in principle commitment from the states to that extra $30 million. I think that the commitment by the states and the Commonwealth to the ongoing programs for women's health is very encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also pointed out a number of benefits of the program. It has been particularly successful in establishing a range of innovative primary health care services for women at the local and state level and in ensuring that a significant number of rural, non-English speaking background and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have been reached by those services. Indeed, the evaluation quite clearly shows that the program has been filling gaps in services, particularly for those categories of women and particularly for women in rural and isolated areas remote from major capital cities. It also highlighted that, although there has been some work done on young women, young unemployed women, women with low incomes and women as carers, there is considerably more work to be done in that area. That is one of the intentions of the next phase of the program which is now under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing that the evaluation highlighted was the need for reliable and accurate data about women's health. I am pleased to say that the announcement of funding of $3.5 million for a major longitudinal study into women's health was an election promise that was actually kept in the budget. That is a very significant step&mdash;it is the first ever longitudinal study into women's health&mdash;and that will actually provide us with accurate data about women, instead of data adapted from men, to allow us to better plan and continue services for women. Finally, one area that was targeted was community services for women with mental health problems. I am certain that, in the light of the Burdekin report, that will continue to be a focus of the national women's health program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware&mdash;as I think anyone who has been reading the papers would be aware&mdash;of the Dumble and Klein paper of allegations of some sort of massive cover-up at government and departmental level about the human pituitary hormone program and the risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. I am pretty disturbed by it. It is important to get on the record how Australia has dealt with the challenge of CJD rather than letting the version that was given at ANZAAS become some part of accepted wisdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because we have the responsibility of providing as much information and support as possible to people on the program, who are naturally anxious about their prospects, we owe it to them not to let sensational claims and headlines distort proper judgment. I will not deny at the outset that Dumble and Klein have done a lot of work in looking at the link between the human pituitary hormone treatment and CJD. But its reliance on anecdotal evidence is extraordinary, to say the least, and its use to sensationalise their paper, seemingly in search of headlines, does not help anyone. Indeed, it has succeeded only in distressing many patients. We know it had this effect because the 008 line on CJD that we set up some time ago received a lot of calls. The newly established national counselling service has also been taking calls from people who are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to put this in context, when this program began in the mid-1960s Robert Menzies was Prime Minister. Since then we have had changes of government, four Liberal prime ministers and a couple of Labor prime ministers. The world has moved a lot in 30 years. To think that information 30 years old could be easily turned up now is a bit spurious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the claims, Australia did act quickly in 1985 after overseas deaths had been recorded and notified. Not only did we stop the program but we also advised former patients in the program not to donate blood or organs. Despite the fact that there is as yet no confirmed clinical evidence to suggest that the disease can be passed on by blood or organs, we acted quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tragically, four Australian women who received the hormone treatment for infertility are known to have died from CJD. Therefore, I announced a public inquiry to be conducted by Professor Margaret Allars of Sydney University.

It will also report on things like the need for counselling and support services.</PARA>

The suggestion is that there has been a 50 per cent increase in the UK and there is a new case in France each week. If there is a new case a week in France, that simply adds up to the normal incidence in the population of one per million. Women who were on the program over that 30-year period should not believe that in some way an epidemic is breaking out because of these figures. That is simply not true.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It relates to the recently released National Bank and other business confidence surveys which show a slight improvement in confidence. There is serious concern in rural Australia that these surveys, based only on the top 500 public companies, will give the wrong signals to policy makers. My question is: can the minister confirm that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has recently undertaken farm surveys which show that between 20 and 25 per cent of farmers intend to leave the land within the next 10 years and another 20 to 25 per cent believe they are likely to leave the land within the next 10 years?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth is moving on a number of fronts to try to look at more outcomes based assessments of health care. National health goals and targets is one of them. I mentioned earlier that in April-May of this year we had agreement from the states to have a national health policy. We have looked at four areas in particular where we might show some advance during the course of one year. They were: accident and injury, cardiovascular disease, cancer&mdash;breast cancer will be given some special attention within that&mdash;and mental illness.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are trying to get some progress on national policies, including goals and targets, during the course of that year.</PARA></TALK.START>

Otherwise those groups contain not only officials from the state and the Commonwealth, but also experts in each field. A report is due next May. We are trying to show some progress in a set of four areas so that, firstly, we know that it can be done and then, hopefully over a decade, we can make progress across the whole range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees also asked whether we will be setting aside additional funds to enable the states to meet national health goals and targets in the light of yesterday's report. I think it would be very difficult for any government, state or federal, to look at the Burdekin report and not realise that more money has to be spent. If more money has to be spent on a national mental health strategy or health goals and targets within it, it is inevitable that there will be some additional Commonwealth funds as a part of that. That is something we will have to look at in terms of our response that I referred to earlier and discuss with the states. In my view, the possibility of offering no extra funds in the light of the Burdekin report would be nil.</PARA>

None of us can be proud when we look back and see what occurred. This very important national travelling exhibition of records, through oral histories, documents and photographs, presents a very small piece of a story of the dispossession of the Aboriginal people.

I have asked the ADF to advise me on the frequency and regularity of such changes, but at this stage any change to a threat assessment would be likely to result in a review of the allowance quantum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, conditions for service for overseas deployments are authorised by different legislation&mdash;taxation through the Treasurer; the deployment allowance and additional recreation leave for remote locality through the Minister for Industrial Relations; and compensation through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Earlier this year, cabinet agreed to a new framework of conditions of services for future overseas deployments of the ADF. The purpose of this change was to ensure that consistent and timely conditions of service could be established for ADF personnel employed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In future deployments, the Minister for Defence will consult with the Prime Minister and make a declaration that an ADF deployment is warlike or non-warlike. The conditions of service will then be set in accordance with that declaration. A centralised process will ensure simplicity and flexibility and enable a timely announcement of benefits to those involved in a deployment. No existing deployment is subject to the new framework that I announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the second issue raised by Senator MacGibbon&mdash;the amendment of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which was passed by the Senate last year&mdash;it is normal for a certificate associated with overseas deployments to be issued by the Chief of the Defence Force retrospectively. For the Cambodian deployment, this certificate will be to the effect that the member's allotment by the ADF relates to that member's service as part of elements of the United Nations forces in Cambodia. It is the intention of the CDF to issue such a certificate on completion of the withdrawal of the Australian forces from Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a certificate has not been issued, the question of revoking the certificate cannot apply. However, it is my intention that, when the certificate is provided, I will meet the spirit of the Opposition's amendment to the tax act by tabling the certificate in the Senate, though it will not be subject to disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators should note that it is normal practice for the provision of tax exemptions to be done on the basis of the government's initial decision regarding a deployment and not when a certificate is issued. This is done in the interests of the service person getting timely access to the benefit that is involved. I would not want to change that process as it could be to the detriment of the individuals concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out again that these issues are complex.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I will deal with Senator MacGibbon's notice of motion. Ordinarily, it would be totally unacceptable to expect any minister to comply with a return to order within the time frame that Senator MacGibbon has attempted to impose on me. In fact, at 3.30 p.m. yesterday I gave leave for him to give notice of a motion which involved a return to order after question time today. In the event of Senator MacGibbon proceeding with his motion, which I assume he probably will not now do, I make the point that in nearly all circumstances I would strongly resist such a move because of the unreasonable timetable that was involved.</PARA>

<PARA>The response of the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson)  to my question about the Burdekin report and mental illness indicated that he seemed to have misunderstood the question. I was drawing attention to the relationship between family breakdown, dysfunctional families, and mental illness, which is very clearly spelt out in Mr Burdekin's report. I asked why the government, in areas of its responsibility, had not given higher priority to developing a national strategy to minimise family breakdown. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not, if the minister wants to have a look at my question. Now that he puts it on the agenda, I have to say that I do hold him responsible to some extent, because any government that has held the financial reins for 10 years, and has allowed so many families to be in such dire financial difficulties as a result of the recession and this extraordinary unemployment rate which will not go, has to be held accountable for the stress and the mental illness that flow from financial strains. Many Australian families&mdash;over 40,000 in a year&mdash;break up simply because of the financial stress on them. So while I was not in my question making that point, I certainly do now in response to what the minister said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister went on and gave the Senate some information that I was not really asking about. I remember his mentioning a figure of something like $135 million that was being spent on mental health. The unfortunate thing for the minister&mdash;and maybe I will give him the benefit of the doubt; he does not really know&mdash;is that that $135 million was already committed to being spent. It was just repackaged so it looked as though the government was doing something new. Perhaps the minister ought to look at that issue while he is learning his new job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing is that if this government were really concerned about the problems of the mentally ill, perhaps it would start giving some meaningful resources to those organisations in the community which are trying to do something for the mentally ill and which have been trying to do that without much support from government for a very long time. I am concerned, particularly because of the portfolios that I hold of both family and health, at the relationship between family breakdown and mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Burdekin has spelled it out in great detail. In the report he said there was a great deal of evidence concerning the distressing and disturbing effect that parental arguments and domestic violence have on children. He said that not only was it distressing for children but also it might lead to mental illness problems such as depression. He said that family disharmony was a major contributor to child mental illness. He said that poor parenting, lack of involvement with and supervision of children, household disorganisation and marital disharmony all increased the risk of mental illness. That was for adults as well as for children. He said that there was an obvious link between the dysfunctional families and mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to know why it was that this government, over 10 years, had not put more resources into the area of protecting and supporting these families, helping them to stay intact; in other words, preventing mental illness. That was the essence of the first part of my question; it was totally ignored by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of my question related to our responsibilities to the mentally ill in terms of protection of their rights. The minister twice was given an opportunity to address that issue. Twice he failed totally to refer to it. It is interesting to note that in 1980 we ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and we incorporated that instrument and others in the Commonwealth Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act in 1986. Yet the Burdekin report itself demonstrates that this government is in breach of its own legislation, in breach of that act. Senator Richardson would not even address that. That says a lot, I guess. He is guilty by virtue of the fact that he would not come to grips with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to principle 1.4 of the United Nations principles of the protection of persons with mental illness and for the improvement of mental care. That principle says that every person with a mental illness shall have a right to exercise all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, et cetera; I do not have time to go on. This government, which likes to talk about independence, is constantly telling us of our responsibilities under international covenants and treaties. Given half a chance here, it will not do it. In relation to Mabo we are told that it is very important that we do not breach our international obligations on racial discrimination. When it comes to looking after the rights of the mentally ill this government has failed them utterly. Why? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could have pointed out that the only mention of mental illness in Fightback is where it suggests that we should have a national mental health policy which, in any event, the governments of Australia agreed to a year ago. As usual, the train pulled out of the station and members of the opposition were still sitting on the platform. They have not managed to do a thing, and that is normal. I chose not to make such a partisan attack because I hope most of us, including most people in Senator Newman's party, can think with a little broader vision than Senator Newman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that others do not seek to run around and say that the government is to blame for family breakdown, which is a nonsense. Obviously, in economically difficult times, extra strains will be placed on families. But strains come on families for a whole range of reasons. It just disappoints me that Senator Newman has to think along those lines. She spoke about the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. If any group had a real hide and gall even to even mention it, it would be the opposition. The opposition has bucketed the concept of international covenants for years and years. Every single time we have sought to sign up with a United Nations covenant, the opposition has opposed it. Its record is 100 per cent. The fact that that occurs is obvious to us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me is that whatever covenants we sign, when it comes to attempting to implement them, there is often a great barrier to implementation in Australia&mdash;the constitution. It is a barrier because very often the Commonwealth can cajole, push and shove but it does not necessarily control, obviously, in a whole range of areas. The one about which we are speaking now is a classic example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the coming years, the Commonwealth's role in mental health, as we work towards trying to implement a national strategy&mdash;particularly with some states that are slacking off in their efforts&mdash;will be to embarrass them and try to make them take further steps along the road to delivering proper funding. It is no secret that there have been savage cuts in a whole range of community services in virtually every state during the 1980s. It is one of the areas that was easiest to cut because the mentally ill were easier to forget than others. That has happened right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of pointing any partisan bone at any state government, the Commonwealth ought to be looking at them all and seeing how we can do better&mdash;just for once.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), to a question without notice asked by Senator Herron this day, relating to youth suicide rates in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson is a great one to pontificate about the opposition and attack us because of questions that are asked of him. He gives out this aura of a complete knowledge of his subject. He did not have a clue today; he was not aware that a very tragic situation of youth suicide exists in rural towns in this country. It is mentioned in the Burdekin report that he pretended that he had read. I refer him to page 638 of the Burdekin report under the heading `Rural young people', which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most alarming increase in male youth suicide rates has been in rural areas and small towns:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rural rates have gone up substantially, particularly in the smaller country towns and farming communities. They have gone up about four-fold, from about 1.4 per 100,000 to about 5.7 per 100,000 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I relate that to research that was done by the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Unit of the Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daybreak</EMPHASIS> program, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's one of the more tragic aspects of the fallout from the collapse in our rural sector and the growth in joblessness; that is the soaring increase in Australia's youth suicide rate, particularly in Australia's country towns. There's been a five-fold increase in teenage suicides in country towns, over the past 20 years . . . girls, young Australian women, between the ages of 15 and 19, are more likely to attempt death than any other age group in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned in my question, the actual number of deaths of young people from suicide in rural towns is higher than the number of deaths from road accidents. The minister cannot wash his hands of that evidence and say that it is unrelated to joblessness. Professor Brent Waters says of suicides among children or teenagers in country towns:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . almost all of them were unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA>There are obviously other factors as Senator Richardson said. The Burdekin report mentions that suicides with guns and the availability of guns in rural areas is associated with depression in rural areas, which in turn is associated with unemployment. Again the Burdekin report mentions the levels of domestic violence, parental alcohol consumption and higher personal alcohol consumption by youth in country towns. There are obviously other factors involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the Burdekin report says that there is a lack of access to health services including mental health resources. That was the point that Senator Newman was referring to&mdash;the lack of access to mental health services in rural areas. There is a direct relationship between that and unemployment and depression in rural communities. There is an association. More than 90 per cent of youths who suicide in country towns are unemployed. To quote Professor Waters again, `almost all of them were unemployed'. The Burdekin report refers to this as `a socioeconomic factor'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a tragedy of our community. It is something that needs to be addressed. I am hoping to highlight this tragedy so that when the Burdekin report is replied to&mdash;as Senator Gareth Evans indicated it would be at the beginning of next year&mdash;this aspect of suicide can be dealt with. Interestingly enough, the suicide rates in Australia have not changed much overall in the 50 years since the Second World War, but there has been a differential increase in youth suicide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledged in the answer that I gave to Senator Herron in question time that there was a link. I do not dispute that for a second. I repeat what I said in question time that none of us will ever be able to directly correlate the two. Certainly there is a link and that is a matter of concern. It means that there does need to be access to services in rural Australia but at the moment there is precious little access. That is the chronic problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we address that problem? I suggest that there are probably two ways. The counselling services are provided by the states. Some states provide those services better than others. Some states hardly provide them at all. We will certainly need to talk to the states about better provision of those services. It is inevitable that that will be included in the response to the Burdekin report that the government will bring down next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also a matter of considerable concern I would have thought is how many psychiatrists, for example, we have in rural areas. We have precious few. I am going to talk to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, as I talk to other colleges, in order to try to make sure that we get a better distribution and we have a rostering service by which we get people out to rural areas. I am encouraged by the responses of colleges to this. Over the next few years we can do a lot better than we have done by taking a cooperative approach with them. Hopefully that can be delivered in psychiatry too. It is the provision of those services that we will have to worry about in responding to the Burdekin report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to push as hard as I can, given that I am not directly responsible for mental health policy&mdash;that is the responsibility of my colleague Brian Howe&mdash;to get these services out of the cities and into the bush. That raises another question: there are not enough services in the cities either. The Burdekin report shows that there is a paucity of services right across the nation. That is something we will have to address with every state and territory. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Richardson will be pleased to know that in no sense do I wish to attack the government over this matter. As he quite rightly pointed out in his answer, the supply of the particular hormone preparation to these patients goes back a very long time and covers very many governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a couple of points. The minister may have been told that patients have found it relatively easy to get information about what they have been treated with, the batch numbers and so on. My experience with the spouses of those who have died from this disease is that they have not found it so easy to get that information. While I believe that no claim should lie against CSL&mdash;it prepared this material in good faith at the time and it did not know that a potential for disease was associated with the product&mdash;I think that, when there is a new treatment such as this which could possibly carry a long-term risk, there should be a responsibility on CSL to keep proper records of the patients who were treated, the batch numbers and so on, so that they could be followed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That bears on the second point I want to make. While, as far as I am aware, nobody has identified the agent which is responsible for the Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome, it seems to be behaving rather like the slow viruses. There is a very long interval between the exposure to the agent and the appearance of the disease, although when the disease appears it progresses quite rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those circumstances, not only it is necessary to keep those records for a long time, but it is extremely dangerous to either give assurances of safety or give assurances that the material is unsafe. We do not know yet how many patients may subsequently go on to develop this disease. I simply caution against giving overly optimistic assurances of safety when many of these patients are still alive and may go on and develop the disease or, alternatively, saying that the risks are very high. The most honest thing to do is to say that we do not know. It is a situation which is very similar to that of exposure to cancer causing agents, where in some instances there is a long interval of 15, 20, 25 or 30 years between exposure and the appearance of the disease. Very often records are not properly kept. Therefore, very often we do not have the data. Assurances of safety are based on ignorance rather than real knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It comes back to this matter of patients being given the correct information. They should be told: yes, they have been treated with this agent; yes, it was batch number so and so; so far there have been no patients appearing associated with that batch number; yes, there have been; this is the current assessment of risks. It should then be left to them. I do not think that doctors, the government or anybody else should be paternalistic in this matter. Patients should be given the full information. It is for them to determine whether they become concerned about it or whether they accept that the risks are well worth while. I know of one woman patient who, before she subsequently died from the disease, said that, despite the effect of the treatment, having children made it well worth while. I think it is for patients to make those decisions&mdash;not governments, doctors or anybody else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When batch numbers are requested, we will give them out when we know which ones are appropriate. The difficulty is that we know which batch numbers were approved for use on some individuals&mdash;not for all&mdash;and we can give those out. However, we cannot guarantee that they were the batch numbers that were actually used on them. It would appear that the way this exercise was conducted so many years ago was probably not up to the standard that we would expect today. So there are uncertainties about what batch numbers were  used. That is why I find it difficult to say to someone, `You do not need to worry; nothing has happened with your batch number'.

When they come in to talk, one cannot really allay their fears.

<PARA>Senator Faulkner was quite right when he said that this was a very complex issue. If he finds it complex, with all the resources of a ministerial department behind him, he should try dealing with this matter without any extra staff and as a backbencher who knows nothing about anything. I can assure him that it is very much harder for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting this in context, last year we passed through this parliament certain conditions applying to service of the Australian defence forces in Cambodia. The principal point there was the provision of an allowance of $65 a day tax free. This was changed a week or so ago to $40 taxable. When Senator Faulkner made his response, he talked about threat assessments and the reasons why the determination was changed. That is a very important point and something that we do not have time to look at today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to stick to the point as to how the change was legally made, not the reasons for it. The legislation went through on 17 June 1992. Page 3843 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> shows that Senator Newman moved two amendments. The first amendment required a certificate establishing the tax-free status to be tabled in the Senate; and the second provided that, if the conditions were changed, the certificate which changed those conditions had to be tabled. The clear intent of that&mdash;this was supported by the Senate and it therefore became law; it is part of the act&mdash;was that the Senate had a right to override the decision of the executive government. That seems to be the point that has been frustrated by the procedures outlined by Senator Faulkner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Senator Faulkner is telling the Senate that the conditions for allowances that the government declared earlier in the year somehow do not apply to the contingents that are currently overseas. The Cambodian deployment clearly was overseas. If one reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report of Mr Bilney's contribution last year in the House of Representatives, this is quite clear. The words `the force in Cambodia' are used all the time. So Senator Faulkner's argument is in conflict with the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner also put to the Senate that somehow or other the Chief of the Defence Force can issue a certificate retrospectively. I understood him to say that at some time in the future the CDF will issue a certificate which validates the fact that the ADF was in Cambodia and therefore entitled to tax-free status. What is the point of having in the act the requirement that the certificates be tabled if at some time 12 or 18 months in the future one can comply with that requirement by tabling a certificate?  I always understood that law was based on facts, not on intentions. If we are going to operate this way, on the basis of the government having the intention of doing something, then I think the Auditor-General ought to look at what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very important point here relates to the morale of the troops. The Australians in Cambodia really feel that they were tricked by a bit of smart politics. The 110 or 120 volunteers who stayed behind after 12 months service to man the rearguard post believed, rightly or wrongly, that their conditions of service would be precisely the same as they had experienced for the previous 12 months. Indeed, it is an extraordinary coincidence that on the day that the great majority of the contingent left, on 7 October, the new requirement&mdash;the change from $65 tax-free to $40 taxable&mdash;was put in place. They feel tricked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is not the money so much that those troops are concerned about, they are really worried about their entitlements under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. They do not know where they are. If they are injured on service, are they covered for compensation? A whole host of things like that is very important to these people. Finally, while the minister is at it, I may be quite wrong in this, but after reading subsection 58B of the Defence Act 1903, I wonder whether the minister has any legal entitlement to make the determinations that he has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of that. The amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 that Senator MacGibbon refers to were moved by Senator Newman on the date that he gave. They are there in black and white. These particular amendments, as I have tried to explain to him, relate to a certificate of revocation. There were two amendments. The first, 23AC(2A), concerns a certificate of revocation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`(2A)A certificate issued in accordance with paragraph (2)(cb) shall cease to have force only in accordance with a certificate of revocation signed by the Chief of the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA>The second amendment moved by Senator Newman was to make such a certificate of revocation a disallowable instrument. That is the import of the two amendments which, as Senator MacGibbon said, were passed by this Senate and the parliament as amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have tried to explain to Senator MacGibbon is this: a certificate of revocation of a certificate of allotment does not have any basis in this particular circumstance, because a certificate of allotment will only be issued by the CDF after the troops return home from Cambodia. A certificate of revocation is to revoke a certificate of allotment. The only disallowable instrument is the certificate of revocation. Hence, when the instrument is provided, in the spirit of what Senator Newman attempted to do, I have said I will table the certificate from the CDF as soon as is practicable and, I might say, in accordance with the way and within the time it has always been done in the past. For example, when the troops returned from the Gulf War, the last return to Australia was on 9 June 1991 and the certificate was issued by CDF on 19 June 1991. This is the usual procedure. It is done retrospectively and it is done so that the entitlements of the Australian personnel are protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When making its decision to commit members of the ADF to serve with UNTAC, the government clearly did recognise that those members would be in a high risk situation. The decision was made to designate Cambodia an operational area from 20 October 1991. Service in an operational area attracts the highest possible coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. All Australian Defence Force personnel who were allotted for service in Cambodia with UNTAC and who served in Cambodia while it was an operational area are certainly eligible to apply for disability pension and service pension under the VEA. Any claim for disability pension for injury, disease or death which occurs while a member of the ADF is on operational service is decided on the more generous reasonable hypothesis standard of proof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Cambodia ceases to be an operational area members of the ADF who remain there will be on hazardous service. They will still be eligible for the disability pension with the reasonable hypothesis standard of proof applying also under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Members on hazardous service are also eligible to apply for compensation benefits under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. I do offer, again, to provide a briefing on these complex issues. I suggest to Senator MacGibbon that he take up my offer. </PARA>

My recollection&mdash;and I must say it is now more than a year, 15 or so months, since I moved those amendments&mdash;is that we were drawing on the experience of the troops who were allocated for service in Namibia. My recollection is that, while we had had 10 years to prepare for the troops to go to Namibia, it was only on the eve of their being sent away that their package of conditions was finalised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a perverse sort of way, I agree with Senator Panizza but I come to a different conclusion. While Senator O'Chee was genuinely trying to assist people in a particular set of circumstances&mdash;I will not reiterate his reasons&mdash;I do not think he put forward the appropriate mechanism. One of the problems is that the honourable senator identified, at least in many circumstances if not all, the wrong fuel type.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on matters which are not to do with requests; they are matters which I raised yesterday when opening the debate in relation to both these bills. I would seek some clarification from the minister on four matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we discussed the size of the bounty per litre. The government has agreed to a 17 1/2c per litre bounty on the ethanol which would be used to make gasohol. I put to the minister yesterday that, since that agreement had been struck, I had received from industry an indication that that amount was sitting right on the very border of profitability; and I also got a guarantee from the industry which is currently producing gasohol that 18c would certainly cause it to go into production. I made a request then that the government give consideration to moving from the 17 1/2c bounty to 18c, but keeping the actual amounts in each year&mdash;the $6 million, $8 million and $11 million in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96&mdash;at the same level. That is the first question, and I hope the minister has received a response back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also said that all the indications are that a 2c differential between leaded and unleaded fuel was the level of difference which everybody advised us was necessary to get a change in behaviour. I suggested, without in any way changing either the impact on those who use leaded fuel or the revenue to government, that the government give some consideration to modifying the timing of the introduction of these changes so that the 2c might come in all at once. One way I suggested that that might happen is that in February next year the 1c increase in the price of unleaded fuel would not proceed and that at some time, probably about 1 June, the increase of 2c on both fuels be adopted so that the price differential of 2c be maintained right through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter on which I would seek some assurance relates to the last two points in the letter which was incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> yesterday. Those points are a direct reflection of the government's own letter to me. The first point is that the government will give favourable consideration to further funds being provided in the next budget for lead abatement programs, the amount to be subject to further investigation and discussion. I would like an assurance that the government will give a firm commitment to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe), the Minister for Transport and Communication (Senator Collins) and the Minister for the Environment, Sports and Territories (Mrs Kelly), in conjunction with the states, will give consideration to ways of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of public transport. I think we would certainly seek some assurance from the government on that one, particularly in view of the fact that, as we understand from a meeting last night, the five-year allocation to public transport has been completed. We would like to see the government give very serious consideration to a continuation of that assistance to the public transport program. So those four matters are: the 17 1/2c to 18c; the 2c all at once; the public transport; and the lead abatement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, earlier in debate I raised with the minister the fact that throughout Australia country people are paying more for petrol than city people. The experience in South Australia is that although a fuel freight subsidy scheme has been put in place by the state government, country people are still paying a lot more. I understand that the government is carrying out an investigation into this differential. After the figures are in, the government should give very serious consideration to attempting to legislate in such a way that country people at least enjoy exactly the same price as city people pay. They should not be used simply as pawns, as it seems they are at the moment, in a price war game in the metropolitan areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can provide some advice on all those four matters, although not on everything that I think Senator Coulter would like. The government is not particularly enamoured of the idea of changing bounty rates on the run in the sort of way that we have undertaken here. I am aware of all the consideration that went into the lead abatement package in the first instance, to which we have agreed. I have had messages from ministers Kelly and Crean which indicate that, given the agreement that the expenditure limit will stay the same, they are prepared to change the rate to 18c. So that will be reflected in the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are not proposing to change the way in which we introduce the differential. It will be done in the two 1c stages as originally proposed. There are arguments for and against. But we think the two increases will come into effect sufficiently quickly and, with the education and the public awareness that has already been generated, we think that should have the desired impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot give any forward commitments about expenditure in next year's budget; it is never possible to do that. There is a lot of interest and debate in the government and across the nation about certain matters, particularly public transport. But, even if the budget were to be brought down tomorrow, I could not give a commitment. Given that that is at least seven months away&mdash;depending on one's view about when it is to be introduced; it may be 10&mdash;I certainly cannot do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of inquiries, as Senator Coulter said, that are relevant&mdash;the Industry Commission inquiry into petroleum retailing; and a continuing Prices Surveillance Authority brief on freight differentials. We will continue to look at those. I do not think it is conceivable that we will legislate to abolish differences. There are some reasonable differences and there are some unreasonable differences. What we do is monitor whether the differences are reasonable, and we will continue to do that. Where we see that there might be an unreasonable distinction, we would be disposed to take some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who lives in Canberra and listens to the ABC must know that such differences are always a cause of some potential for publicity and agitation. But it does not necessarily mean that the government can in some way&mdash;even if the Commonwealth had the power, which I think is a bit arguable&mdash;legislate to abolish the difference. But we will continue&mdash;the Industry Commission inquiry in particular may well raise some interesting points about petroleum retailing, and we will have a look at that when the report comes down&mdash;to see whether there is some action that we can take. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments are similar in impact and intent to the amendments I moved to the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. I was at the same meeting that Senator Coulter attended last night. I want to reiterate that it is of concern to the Greens that the funding for real programs in terms of car use is winding down. The same kind of thing is happening to the better cities program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate in relation to petrol and fuel excise during this budget program has largely centred on levels of lead, but it would be difficult for anyone to be blind to the fact that the problems that exist with car use are general emissions, the level of greenhouse gas, the whole value system in which we continue to allow cars to be the major form of transportation, and the fact that we continue to design our cities to make more and more people dependent on cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's current policy and the opposition's continued emphasis on deregulating wages and conditions and on competing in the international market mean that fewer people have the income to support small businesses. Therefore, as a consumer I often find that I have to go further and further to get to goods and services of a specialised nature, whether it is clothing or articles for the household. So our economic and social policies are working in exactly the wrong way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to go to centres to get specialised goods. Often companies cannot afford to hold stocks any more because in the last few years we have so much emphasised that what we are doing is pushing economic policy towards an export market and forgetting that the people who are workers are also the people who buy our goods and services on the local market. We are actually requiring people to be more dependent on cars. People who cannot afford expensive cars continue to buy cars which have higher levels of emission, including higher lead emission rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We emphasise that it is not good enough for the government to mainly concentrate on the consumer side. Last night the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) said that the petroleum industry in Australia was not prepared to put the money in to fund a comprehensive program for lead abatement; that it was providing some services towards it but could not be talked into providing funding for a more comprehensive program. So it has come back to the consumer and to an education program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get particularly annoyed with the fact that we will put up with lower standards than other countries would put up with. Whether or not it is a highly industrialised, highly capitalist oriented country such as the United States or Japan, the standards that industry is expected to produce are often much better than the standards that we in Australia are prepared to put up with. I think that is disgraceful. Like the Australian Democrats, the Greens will be watching very closely. We will continue to push for proper levels of funding to be provided for a real continuation of the better cities program to look at the equity considerations of housing, public transport and infrastructure that actually assist in providing a strategy in the medium to long term for a decrease in the dependence on car transport in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lead education program certainly has some benefits, but it is not enough&mdash;and it is taking the heat off industry, which also has a responsibility. Industry is not going to do it unless we ask it to. I was also shocked to find that the minister for the environment indicated that if the levels could be reduced simply by consumer behaviour, there was no need to put pressure on industry to improve its act. I think that is accepting second best on behalf of the health and environment of Australia. It certainly is not indicating that this government currently believes that these considerations are important. We will be watching very carefully. I moved my amendments because I would like to think that the government will endorse its own policies. We have done nothing here except ask it to commit itself to its own policies. </PARA>

The inquiry was undertaken at a time of increasing public debate, both in Japan and elsewhere, with Japan increasingly being encouraged to take on a more active role in the Asia-Pacific region commensurate with its economic status and in line with its increasing assumption of international responsibilities, and at a time when the role of UN peacekeeping operations as a tool in addressing conflict was taking on growing importance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to actively encourage the development of regional security dialogue aimed at confidence building, promoting greater transparency, strengthening arms control measures and developing cooperative regional security activities in the Asia-Pacific region.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government attaches great importance to encouraging the  further development of a regional security dialogue. In December 1989, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, delivered a Ministerial Statement on Australia's Regional Security to the Senate. While a number of events affecting the region's overall security environment have taken place since then, the analyses and responses outlined in that Statement remain valid and continue to form the basis for efforts by Australia to promote security in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security outlook in the Asia-Pacific region is much more fluid now than it has been for almost four decades. The end of the Cold War, the rapid economic growth of North-East and South-East Asia and the continued impact of nationalism have brought about major changes. This new fluidity has created many opportunities, but it has also given rise to a number of uncertainties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the positive side, recent reaffirmation by the United States' Administration of its strategic commitment to the region is most welcome and should allay regional fears of a precipitate draw-down of forward-deployed US military forces in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan too has made adjustments to its post-Cold War situation and to growing expectations of a more active role in regional affairs. Settlement of the Cambodia conflict removes a long-standing source of tension and division. Both Australia and Japan played an important part in that settlement. Recent moves toward closer links between the Indochinese states and the ASEAN countries also open the way for the political and economic reintegration of the Indochinese countries into the region. Although current progress in lacking, recent steps toward rapprochement on the Korean Peninsula are an encouraging development which, if fulfilled, should promote regional stability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the failure by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to end suspicions about the intent of its nuclear program by allowing unfettered access by international inspectors poses a serious threat to regional security and threatens to undermine the integrity of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). This problem underlines the importance of international action to prevent proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), an area in which Australia has committed significant effort in encouraging continuing commitment to the NPT, conclusion of the Chemical Weapons Convention and effective WMD export controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unresolved territorial disputes, including in the South China Sea and over the Northern Territories, and transnational issues, including smuggling, piracy and the uncontrolled movement of people, are other sources of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asia-Pacific countries have, however, begun to work together in responding to these new challenges and there is a rapidly growing sense of regional community. In 1992, the region's preeminent multilateral political body, the ASEAN Post-Ministerial Conference (PMC), was endorsed as an appropriate forum in which regional security matters could be canvassed. Regional security issues are now firmly on the PMC agenda, indicative of a general trend toward more regular and open dialogue on security questions among regional countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there was agreement at the last PMC meeting in  Singapore in July to establish a Regional Security Forum in which not just the ASEAN countries and their traditional dialogue partners would participate, but also Russia, China, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea. All the major security players in the region are now included in a forum where discussions can take place across the whole range of significant politico-security issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been active in further broadening bilateral defence links with regional countries and in developing proposals for practical confidence building and cooperative measures, including encouraging transparency in the fields of weapons acquisition, force structure and defence policy generally. More specific examples of these practical proposals include exchange of maritime information and training for UN peacekeeping operations. We firmly believe that these sorts of measures, coupled with enhanced dialogue among Asian-Pacific countries, including on economic development and regional trade liberalisation issues, offer the best opportunity to manage regional security concerns over the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new patterns of cooperation need consolidation.

The nature of Japan's contribution to peacekeeping activities remains a sensitive one, both within Japan and internationally. Passage of the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations (UNPKO) legislation in Japan in 1992 was only secured after long and difficult negotiations. The legislation provides essentially for the dispatch of Japanese Self Defence Force personnel, civilian police and seconded officials for a range of non-military, support duties. The issue is still problematical in Japan, notwithstanding the successful conclusion of the first overseas mission of Japanese PKO personnel in Cambodia.

Australia and Japan do share a number of common interests on secure access to sea lines of communication (SLOCs) due to their large bilateral trade. The SLOCs issue does, however, encompass the interests of most, if not all, regional countries. The interests of member countries of ASEAN are, in particular, directly involved in the sea lanes through the region. These countries must be involved in consideration of secure access to these sea lines. The wider international community has a stake too for strategic and commercial reasons. The United States' forward military presence in the Western Pacific contributes to a sense of security about sea lines of communication. Australia already has regular and ad hoc consultations with Japan on international and regional arms control issues, including the Chemical Weapons Convention and measures to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction. We have maintained close contact on nuclear non-proliferation issues and on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy in day-to-day diplomatic contacts, in international forums and through regular meetings held under Australia's bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement with Japan.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that military exchanges between Australia and Japan other than those noted in Recommendation 7 be maintained at about the current level and that the views of regional countries, particularly ASEAN, be canvassed on any proposed changes in the nature or level of exchanges. If a limited enhancement of the present exchanges were to be considered priority should be given to exchanges of personnel involved in the development of defensive capabilities such as defence-related information technologies, simulation technologies and over-the-horizon radar. Recognising Australia's and Japan's strong common interest in the security of Sea Lines of Communication, the development of maritime surveillance capabilities should be emphasised in any future consideration of bilateral military activities.</PARA>

Contacts with Japan on defence and security issues are concentrated on dialogue and visits, rather than cooperative activities between the military forces of the two countries, apart from ship visits. Japan's exclusively defence-oriented policy will perforce encourage emphasis on defensive capabilities in any enhancement of current defence exchanges.

The kit will be introduced into Japanese schools in 1994. Moreover, a book on the Burma-Thailand Railway by Professor Gavan McCormack, who appeared before the Committee during the inquiry, will shortly be published in Japanese. The Australian Embassy in Tokyo will be assisting in obtaining publicity for the book in consultation with the Japanese publisher.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pleasing to have such a positive response from the government to the 10 recommendations contained in the report of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Japan's defence and security in the 1990s. It is important to note that the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), has just presented to the Senate the government's response to the committee's report, and I believe that it is essential that the committee set aside time to study it in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal firstly with the tabling statement presented by the minister. It is worth while to draw attention to the fact that the government agrees with the general conclusions of the committee and its description of the emerging regional security environment and the response of Japan to trade development. There is also acceptance by the government of the committee's recommendation to call for Australia to continue actively to encourage the development of regional security dialogue; expand dialogue with Japan on regional security issues, including on UN peacekeeping; secure access to sea lines of communication, regional arms control and peaceful use of nuclear energy, but to maintain military exchanges between Australia and Japan at about the current level; encourage the United States to maintain and articulate a strong commitment to the security of Japan and the region; facilitate more constructive political and economic engagements between Japan and the rest of the region; and to allay regional concern about Japan's role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that at subsequent meetings the committee needs to look further in some detail at the government's response. It is not my intention today to go through all the recommendations and responses. However, I want to draw attention to one recommendation and response which I think are fairly important. The recommendation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, through an organisation such as the Australian-Japan Foundation, sponsor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the addition of a Japanese soundtrack to the film "Kokoda&mdash;the Bloody Track" and facilitate distribution of the film in Japan; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.   <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the writing of an accurate history to be published in an accessible format in both Japanese and English; to give a comprehensive account of the involvement of Japanese and Australian forces in Southeast Asia and the Pacific in World War II.</PARA>
<PARA>The first part of the response by the government certainly goes a long way towards meeting recommendation 9 of the committee. The government's response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian-Japanese Foundation (AJF) Executive Committee considered the Committee's recommendation. It agreed to raise with the Australian Army, which has copyright to the film "Kokoda, the Bloody Track", the addition of a Japanese soundtrack and to approach NHK and Japanese commercial television networks to ascertain their interest in buying broadcast rights. This approach, if successful, would have the advantage of gaining a wide audience for the film.</PARA>
<PARA>The second part of the recommendation talks about the writing of an accurate history of World War II. It is reasonable to say that the response from the government is that some action is being taken on that. While it is not possible to meet the exact recommendation of the committee, the action that has been taken goes a long way towards meeting the requirements of the committee under that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that the Japanese government has recently acknowledged the waging of an aggressive war by the former imperial army and the suffering caused by Japan's action in the Asia-Pacific region. That in itself shows that the present Japanese government is going a long way towards redressing the problems that have been shown over a number of years in relation to its version of World War II and what happened in the Pacific.

As you, with me, were one of those involved in writing this report, I am sure that you will welcome the carefulness and positive tones of the government's response to our report and the 11 recommendations that are set out in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the statement that has been made here today on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. I will quote a few phrases in the government's response which very positively endorse the findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The first states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government agrees with the general conclusions of the Committee in describing the emerging regional security environment and the response of Japan to these developments.</PARA>
<PARA>In another place it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also acknowledges the overall conclusion of the Committee that the expected changes in Japan's defence policies and activities should be directed to global and regional peace and security objectives and in identifying a role for Australia in helping shape the region's approach to security and in facilitating dialogue with Japan and between Japan and the region.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not just speaking here about motherhood or slapping each other on the back for being in favour of peace and amity in our region. The report and its 11 precise recommendations are quite specific. It is my judgment that this report could not have been written five years ago, and certainly not 10 or 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a measure of the maturity of the bilateral relations between Australia and Japan that it has been possible for the Australian government, in the last few years, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Defence, the Prime Minister and, indeed, opposition spokesmen&mdash;who have been very complementary and reinforcing of the initiatives the Australian government and its ministers are taking&mdash;to move to an agenda which is reflected in the Senate committee report and the government's response to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak of the precise stage that we have now reached in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation process; the foreshadowing of the important meeting in Seattle next month; the ASEAN post-ministerial conference; the security dialogue that has emerged with a great stride forward in the middle of this year, 1993; and the appropriateness of that forum, having evolved over a number of years, to be a very practical and viable forum for regional countries on security matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the early stages of the term of office of the new United States president, President Clinton. Some doubts, worries and anxieties have been expressed about whether this generational change in the United States will deny some of the personal and very positive commitments that the United States has made in past decades to our region and to understanding our region. President Clinton and the new administration have made a positive transition and are bringing freshness to the United States' views of the Asia-Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States has made a firm commitment to the Japan-US defence treaty, which is one of the most important treaties in the world today. It is certainly fundamental to the economic prosperity of Japan and the other economic tigers&mdash;Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and others&mdash;in the east Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no vacuum in security matters in our region because security is largely made complete by the US's relationship with the region, not least in the triangle of the United States, Japan and Australia. President Clinton's response to the visit of Prime Minister Keating in Washington in recent weeks is a very positive instance of what I have been referring to and it is writ large and specifically in the Senate's report and the government's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the increased focus on UN peacekeeping in the world and the rather delicate discussion in recent years in Japan about its making a contribution to peacekeeping. The Senate committee endorses Japan's moves not only to make a financial contribution, which it did very substantially to the international allies in the Gulf War for peace enforcement, but also to allowing non-combatant&mdash;unarmed&mdash;engineering and other support personnel from Japan to be a part of the peacekeeping group deployed in Cambodia and Somalia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the bilateral relations between Australia and Japan. Not only is Japan Australia's most significant trading partner, but increasingly, on a wide range of issues, Australia and Japan now have a very mature level of bilateral discussions. This includes defence, as it ought to, with the limits that are set out in the Senate committee's report and which are endorsed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A dialogue has been established between the Senate committee and the government, in particular with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence, in this area of discussion. It is difficult to give any bouquets to one side or another in relation to who initiated which idea first. This dialogue has been mutually helpful to members of parliament and, I hope, to ministers, but certainly to the senior officers of these departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to conclude my remarks by, for a couple of minutes, referring to the importance of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Some months ago&mdash;probably five months ago&mdash;at the beginning of this parliament, there was pressure in terms of getting sufficient numbers to service various committees. It was, God forbid, actually proposed that this committee be abolished. I was most grateful when, after some discussions, the committee structure still retained a Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I take this benchmark of late October to give an instance of the ongoing life and value of this committee, which is very active in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A meeting was held today between 8.30 and 10 a.m. of 11 senior public servants who were put together as a task force to work on our report on Latin America and on the implementation of 63 recommendations to which the government has also positively responded. That task force is in the middle of its two-year life of implementing, according to government guidelines, the response to the Senate committee. In the private meeting of the committee today, we had before us a draft of our own annual report on the annual reports that the Senate receives in the areas of foreign affairs, defence and trade. It is right that all of the reports that come before us in these three areas be addressed by one of our standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made arrangements today for hearings on Monday and Friday next week on our next major inquiry: China-Australia relations. We also discussed today the details of some ship visits with regard to another inquiry which was actually referred to us by the two defence ministers&mdash;the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner). That inquiry relates to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS> and to the issue of sexual harassment in the three defence services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that another of our most recent reports on the United States presidential election debate and the repercussions of that debate on Australia and this region might well have been in the Prime Minister's pocket when he met with President Clinton in recent weeks. From all of the reports of the very positive discussion that flowed between our Prime Minister and the President of the United States, it was entirely consistent and followed through the kinds of conclusions and the kinds of priorities that we in the Senate were urging upon the government of Australia in its dialogue with the United States. I refer to APEC, to NAFTA, to GATT, to the defence relationship and to this triangle between the United States, Japan and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I instance these half dozen matters as reinforcement of my belief that the Senate continues to do positive work on a number of fronts. It is with some real satisfaction that I warmly receive the government's response to our report on Japan's defence and security in the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training has undertaken a most comprehensive inquiry since May 1992. It has received 66 submissions from a vast array of conflicting interests and has interviewed some 34 witnesses. Owing to the pressure of business that came before the Senate last week, I missed the opportunity to speak to this report. I thank the secretary of the committee, Brenton Holmes, and his assistants, Doug Hynd and Kathleen Griffiths, who should be congratulated. I think all members of the committee would share that sentiment because of the way in which they have handled the material and the administrative arrangements for this inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this inquiry into the operation of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act, it is quite clear that three central points stand out: firstly, that actions and court proceedings relating to sections 45D and 45E clearly belong in the industrial arena, not the trade practice or corporate arena; secondly, that the use of sections 45D and 45E in the courts by employer and business groups has been to limit industrial action not directly related to secondary boycotts, thus giving employers additional power and advantage in regard to legitimate industrial action involving workers; and, thirdly, that the use of these sections is in direct conflict with Australia's obligations under ILO conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To understand how the committee arrived at these conclusions, we need to look at the history of sections 45D and 45E, their application, other constraints available, and the international industrial environment in which we are working at the moment. In 1977 section 45D was inserted into the Trade Practices Act by the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr John Howard. It was clearly Labor's view at that time that Mr Howard, who had a close association with the business community, was seeking to do what he could to strengthen the hand of business in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1978 the Trade Practices Act was further amended to outlaw primary boycotts which interfered with interstate and overseas trade. In 1980 section 45E was inserted to target deceptive business practices. It prohibited a contract or arrangement between a union and a business or a person to prevent the supply of goods and services to a third person. It was clear from the way these sections were used that a much broader agenda was operating than was originally intended when the act was established. That became abundantly clear to me in the course of our inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became obvious to me that the use of sections 45D and 45E was closely associated with organisations and political groups which had a set agenda to discredit the industrial relations scheme of things as we currently know it. They clearly had a hostility to the existing arrangements of awards and tribunals for setting industrial relations that have developed throughout this country's history, which up until recently have existed throughout every jurisdiction in this country except Victoria, where the industrial relations system has been thoroughly gutted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Tim Abey, the director of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was asked whether he observed any reluctance by employers to use sections 45D and 45E. He said that that was the case with employers who had some commitment to the industrial relations system. But when he was asked whether it was his experience as an industrial relations practitioner that some other employer organisations did not have the same commitment to the industrial law process and therefore were more willing to use this sort of measure, Mr Abey replied, `Yes, I think that would be a fair comment'. He also indicated that in the course of his work as an industrial relations practitioner this particular measure had been threatened hundreds of times through the industrial relations practices and the day-to-day work of organisers who work for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A threat was being used in a punitive way&mdash;a bludgeon which, as he indicated, was clearly designed to assist one particular side in the resolution of industrial disputes. If we look at the history of these things, we see that the use of the proceedings before the courts is somewhat more complicated. Of the 206 injunctions that have been issued under these proposals, only 81 have been granted and only two have gone through to full damages. The ideological presumption behind the use of these measures cannot be underestimated. It is a punitive measure designed to bludgeon industrial opponents, and designed and used quite particularly by people who were closely associated with New Right industrial organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence presented by Mr Freeburn on behalf of the ACTU also indicated that the same sorts of processes occurred in Victoria, as in the case of the National Farmers Federation. We have seen fighting funds established not to assist innocent third parties but as a vehicle for the political expression of a political and ideological view as to the way in which unions and workers should be treated in the industrial relations scheme. We have seen this happen on many occasions and we have also seen it fail desperately many times. The case of Seymour Meats is one example that was referred to in evidence. Mr Brian Noakes, speaking on behalf of Victorian employers, indicated that that essentially was the case. However, on occasions employers had got it wrong&mdash;they had picked the wrong targets&mdash;and fallen very badly. That has been the case with the use of those provisions against the meat workers in Victoria in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that this issue has been a vehicle for the expression of ideology rather than a legitimate weapon in the industrial relations machinery. It is not an appropriate means by which one should seek to resolve industrial relations disputes. However, members of the H.R. Nicholls Society, the National Farmers Federation, Kroger and Kroger, and various other soldiers in this war may find the committee's proposals reprehensible. The main point is that there need to be changes in view of the changed industrial and political circumstances this country finds itself in at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has sought to remove these particular provisions before. In 1984 it sought to repeal sections 45D and 45E and to give enhanced conciliation powers and responsibility for boycotts to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. That proposal was defeated in the Senate. In 1987 a similar attempt was made. Again, that motion failed due to the election. In 1988 the Hawke government sought to remodel the Industrial Relations Act, and that failed as well. In 1989 the Democrats sought to amend the Industrial Relations Act and that failed as well. Essentially, it has failed as a result of either the lack of political will or the lack of the sort of political coalition necessary to actually get the proposals through the Senate. I do not believe that that is the case any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly significant, and ironic in a sense, that it was the employers who went to the ILO. The employers said that we needed an investigation into Australia's international obligations on the question of the size of unions. The ILO said that the proposals of the Australian government relating to the size of unions were inappropriate. At that point the ACTU was able to say, `If that is the case, we can then look at the question of Australia's other industrial obligations'. It is ironic that it was the employers who initiated the involvement of the ILO in these processes, and it is at this point, given the number of failures that have occurred in recent times, that we now see the possibility of real change in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the ILO formally requested the Australian government to bring the provisions of the Trade Practices Act into conformity with the ILO convention. In 1992, on motion by Senator Bell, seconded by Senator Cooney, this inquiry was established. It is quite clear from where I stand on these issues that this inquiry has been most welcome, as are its findings. We have to understand the ILO's position, given its central importance in this whole issue. The ILO, through its Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and Committee on Freedom of Association of the Government Body of the ILO, indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the right to strike is one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations for the promotion and protection of their economic and social interests. These interests not only have to do with obtaining better working conditions and pursuing collective demands of an occupational nature, but also with seeking solutions to economic and social policy questions and to labour problems of any kind which are of direct concern to the workers.</PARA>
<PARA>This right is based on article 3 of convention No. 87, the Right to Organise, which protects the rights of organisations of workers `to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programs'. I would be the first to recognise that this is not an unrestricted right. The committee also pointed out that that right may be restricted in relation to a number of other matters relating to the way in which governments function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are fundamental principles at stake here. The recommendation of the ILO indicates that quite a balanced approach is being taken. The fundamental question is the right of workers to actually organise and protect themselves. Quite clearly, the arrangements under 45D and 45E infringe upon the basic commitments the Australian government has entered into. The government understands that the opposition does not support such a view. Given where it stands in the political scheme of things, one would not expect the opposition to agree at any point with this report. Therefore, it followed that there would be a minority report on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be understood, however, is that this is a matter that will be debated throughout the community, and I look forward to that. It will give Australians an opportunity to understand just where the opposition stands on these fundamental human rights issues. It will give the public an opportunity to understand exactly what the industrial relations policies of the Liberal Party mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was apparent that, when the quite draconian propositions of the Liberal Party were put to the electorate at the last election, those propositions were not accepted. It is quite apparent that the industrial relations attitudes reflected in the opposition's policies essentially hark back to what it sees as a brighter time, a golden age when the right of management was clearer, when it was clear that workers had a place in society which was to be at the beck and call of employers. It is quite clear that the freedom of contract debates of the 19th century sit quite easily with the current industrial relations policies of the conservative coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the people of this country will continue to reject that sort of attitude because it stands in sharp contrast to the great history and traditions of this nation. One of the earliest industrial relations policies of this parliament was the establishment of the conciliation and arbitration machinery which reflected the fundamental values that exist within the Australian body politic: that is, the capacity for people to organise, to express themselves industrially and to defend themselves, coupled with the capacity of the state to intervene to ensure that disputes are settled and that there is a proper and legitimate expression of industrial and economic concerns along with genuine industrial and social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has not always been the case in this country. It is very interesting to note, in terms of Australia's history of industrial relations, that the employers in this country turn away from arbitration in times of depression when they believe their position will be strengthened, when the army of unemployed are there as a threat to be used against workers who remain in work. However, in boom times they turn back to arbitration because it is a device by which they seek to control wages and conditions. The Labor Party's attitude is that in both good times and bad there should be a floor in our industrial relations scheme to protect ordinary conditions, community standards, and to provide for basic decency in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we also recognise the need to organise industrial affairs to allow for direct discussions between bosses and workers. We do not believe that the state should be used in a draconian way to cripple industrial organisations or to even up the score on behalf of employers in such a way as to prevent workers from expressing their legitimate rights and concerns about their social and economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with sections 45D and 45E is that they do exactly that. Many now understand their full implications when they are applied to social and industrial questions. It is quite possible that community groups are directly affected. In the case of green bans, for instance, conservationists have been complaining to our committee about the way in which 45D and 45E fundamentally infringe democratic rights and the right to defend basic issues such as the heritage of this country&mdash;for example, old buildings&mdash;and prevent the expression of legitimate political views about the way in which our society should be controlled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report argues that 45D and 45E are needed. The opposition is constantly arguing that it is necessary to enforce union compliance with industrial law. That is simply not the case. If one looks at the various penalties and provisions that exist within industrial practice in this country, one finds that there are a host of opportunities for the enforcement of compliance with industrial awards and industrial agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline some of the compliance mechanisms that can be used in industrial action. These are penalties under the Industrial Relations Act; penalties under state arbitration statutes; various injunctions and damages at common law; various sanctions under the state and federal essential services legislation; the state equivalents of 45D and 45E which exist in Victoria and New South Wales; the issue of deregistration; the capacity to suspend or cancel awards; the application of a `no work as directed, no pay' principle or the termination of employment; penalties under grievance handling arrangements and other informal measures agreed to by the parties themselves; and informal sanctions imposed by tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see within the existing industrial relations framework is that there are many other options available to employers. Only a minority of employers turn to 45D and 45E as a vehicle for bludgeoning workers and they are mainly those employers who are tied in with a political agenda and have no concern for the interests of so-called innocent third parties. We have yet to see a case where the innocent third party has popped up in an industrial dispute and presented material to the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen is that by and large where organisations have engaged in this sort of action&mdash;small companies that are often the vehicle for the National Farmers Federation&mdash;they have immediately collapsed upon the settlement of the matters in the legal process. In the case of Mudginberri, the so-called injured party was the pawn of other political forces who had other political agendas aimed at furthering the interests of New Right organisations and pursuing particular factional interests within the National and Liberal parties of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to address the mechanisms that will actually lead to the settlement of industrial disputes rather than furthering the political objectives of minority ideological groups within employer organisations. I am afraid that the opposition has failed to understand that it has now been some time since the Australian industrial relations system has matured and that the crude models it has been pursuing since the 1970s have been doomed to failure as a result of a fundamental political rejection at the hands of the Australian electorate. It has policies that do not reflect the attitudes, the aspirations and the values of Australians. As a consequence, the use of punitive clauses and various other common law actions by New Right legal firms will ultimately fail to attract the necessary community and public support that a political organisation needs if it is ever to seek the broad support within the community that is necessary to actually win an election. As far as I am concerned, that is the name of the game in terms of maintaining government. It gives us the capacity to talk to others about removing such draconian and undemocratic propositions that are fundamentally in breach of the human rights concerns we have as a country and as a labour movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament must recognise that there is a need for a process of continuing dialogue and a mechanism which allows parties to work towards common goals in industrial relations. I believe it is essential that we recognise that working men and women have legitimate social and economic interests and that they have legitimate methods of pursuing them through their unions and other means. Fundamentally, it has to be recognised that these interests are just as legitimate as the rights of owners of capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This fundamental dichotomy has to be understood by the courts and by the various state apparatus that exist within this country. It has to be recognised that these are fundamental principles of a social democracy. They are fundamental human rights issues which are the hallmarks of a civilised society. At the moment, we do not have that clear understanding within this country. We do not have a clear and agreed understanding of the legitimacy of working people. We have a view expressed by some that the freedom of contract means the freedom of employers to do as they wish; the unfettered right of business to pursue its particular objectives. In this debate today, I expect that we will hear that view expressed. I am sure that discussion will be ongoing within this country as the whole framework of the industrial relations package is rewritten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has embarked on a policy that encourages enterprise bargaining. It will introduce a whole series of new industrial relations legislation. It is in that context that the outmoded Trade Practices Act has little value in achieving a productive and cooperative industrial climate which will help strengthen the economic recovery and Australia's position with respect to other industrial societies. I hope this report is widely read and I trust that it is widely debated. I look forward to participating in that debate and I hope many other honourable senators in this chamber do too. </PARA>

The capitulation of the government to the ACTU and union power has turned the clock back many years.

We are moving down an enterprise agreement path, as the government puts it. Yet even when there are no union members in the workplace, the union movement is given the effective power of veto over those enterprise agreements. This means that there will be very few enterprise agreements&mdash;I would suggest none&mdash;in the non-union sector of the work force, which comprises 70 per cent of the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not argue that employees in the work force do not have legitimate rights; nor do I argue that employers do not have legitimate rights.

We have a wonderful opportunity to modernise our industrial relations system in order to bring it more into line with our international competitors and to look at what is happening in other countries. It is obvious that that is not being done. An important point in the debate and this inquiry is that Australia is the only country that maintains a compulsory arbitration system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the substance of the report and to explain why we put in a dissenting report. It is essential that there is balance in a system. Sections 45D and 45E were brought in because of the irrational actions that a number of unions were involved in. It is interesting to hear the NFF's name mentioned; it is interesting to hear Mudginberri mentioned; it is also interesting to hear the New Right mentioned. I certainly was an active member of the NFF, I have been branded as being part of the New Right, and I was certainly involved in Mudginberri. Senator Murphy, my colleague on the other side of the house, has also been involved in 45D and 45E matters.

But it is absolutely incorrect for Senator Carr to refer to it in the way he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal with some of the reasons why we put in a minority report. First we identified what we believed were the key issues and what the report was about. The first of those key issues related to whether or not under sections 45D and 45E employees were able to exercise their legitimate rights to take action to protect their wages, working conditions, terms and conditions of employment and so on. In a precedent in court&mdash;and I am glad Senator Carr mentioned the Victorian situation&mdash;in a case between MATFA and AMIU, just to give one example, it was held up in court. It was found that those individuals who were taking action with regard to the detail of accord mark 6 were not in breach of sections 45D and E. In terms of the application of section 45D and whether it interfered with the legitimate rights of employees that was a very important case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is not the only case. The majority chose to ignore that piece of evidence, and I think it is very sad that they did. Their position on this matter is one of ideology. We knew what the outcome of the majority report was going to be before we went in. The position that was put by the witnesses in terms of the report&mdash;whether arguing one way or another&mdash;was put very passionately and with a lot of feeling. We as members of the committee have to look even more carefully at the facts that are put before the committee in that inquiry and try to avoid being swayed by the passion that comes through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr spent some time on employer behaviour. He made the point, which I was going to make, that only two actions have gone through. A point that I think needs making about the use of sections 45D and 45E is that they have not been used extensively. In all parts of the law that relate to interference with trade and the actions that could be taken in this area&mdash;and there are a number of jurisdictions in which you can operate&mdash;they have probably been used less than any other. One thing we all agreed on was that sections 45D and 45E were very effective in protecting the interests of an employer. In saying that, one has to recognise what they are about. They are about protecting the legitimate rights of individuals or businesses to go about their business without interference, whether it be industrial or political interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that prior to the introduction of sections 45D and 45E, businesses in this country were held to ransom in many instances and so was the country, and a lot of economic harm was done. I particularly refer to the bans on the Chilean and Indonesian ships back in the mid-1970s. At that time the silos in Western Australia were full and we could not get the wheat out and it put at risk a harvest. It put at risk the livelihoods of a whole host of people. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, that case had to be resolved by going to the Crimes Act, which was much more cumbersome and much more draconian. You can get put in gaol under the Crimes Act for interference with trade. It was equally strong in terms of damages that could be extracted. The problem with it was that it was very slow and cumbersome. One should recognise that business has a right to protect itself from damage. It should not be put in a position where it can be damaged on the one hand and not have recourse to cover those damages on the other hand. Sections 45D and 45E overcame those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to touch on whether sections 45D and 45E unfairly impeded individuals' civil liberties. Once again, one has to go to the courts to get a precedent to show that this does not occur. When I looked at the cases involving sections 45D and 45E I did not find a case where a 45D or 45E action had impeded people's civil liberties. We did find a case, the J-Corps case in Western Australia, where the BLF took action against J-Corps but where, when it was taken to the courts, the courts found that because the target of that boycott action was the Western Australian government&mdash;it was the Burke or Dowding government; I am not sure which one&mdash;and Homeswest, sections 45D and 45E did not stand up. Their protest action and their target in terms of exercising that civil liberty was the Western Australian government. Once again, in that important precedent the court found the situation as I have outlined it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I make is whether Australia was in breach of its obligation under the International Labour Organisation conventions. We can all find little bits and pieces that we can quote to make our case, but when we look at the totality of the decision with regard to ILO conventions we find that the restriction there was one of a very limited nature, and that was borne out in the evidence. We also found that they went on to say that under a compulsory arbitration system there was a good case to disallow strikes while an award was in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I throw out the challenge to the other members on the committee who put down the majority report to recognise the point, which I have recognised, that there was a restriction, but it was a very limited restriction. I think it is a very grave mistake to use a convention such as that and a judgment that has been made on that just to try to make a case with regard to one's point when the decision that was made was much broader. In terms of the ILO conventions and the evidence that was given to us, and having read those decisions very carefully, I do not believe that sections 45D and 45E as they stand contravene our conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say a little more about conventions. It is about time that Australian parliaments, and this parliament in particular, recognised that it is our responsibility to make Australian domestic law and not to be controlled by the types of conventions we are talking about now. We make reference to that in our report. When we talk about ILO conventions and how they sit I think that Australia, for whatever reason, is placing far too much weight on those conventions and not looking at the domestic situation. One must also note that when the limitation of 10,000 to form a trade union was brought in&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to raise is whether businesses or organisations who have had boycotts brought against them have found sections 45D and 45E effective in having the boycotts removed. I believe the committee agreed that the answer was yes. The committee found that the knowledge that sections 45D and 45E existed was also very effective. I believe that the international bans that occurred in the days prior to the enactment of sections 45D and 45E would have continued to occur if those provisions had not been in place. If the government goes down the line that it is suggesting, we will see a return to those bad old days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act are about the constraint of trade and they are appropriately placed. If we go down the government's route, as is outlined in Mr Brereton's paper, and have periods of 72 hours before action can be taken, I believe that will just be&mdash;and mark these words&mdash;a licence to damage. It is not a path that this country should go down; it is not a path that should be necessary in a nation where we have compulsory conciliation and arbitration. If we are going to maintain that particular system, then that system should be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations made in the committee's majority report were disappointing. I do not believe that they are in the best interests of this nation. We made clear in the minority report that the overwhelming evidence was that the concerns could not be substantiated. The direction in which we are now heading with our industrial relations system, moving back to where we were 10, 15 or 20 years ago in terms of transference of power from the elected government to the union movement, is regrettable. In fact, one could even say today that the current government is becoming a subsidiary of the ACTU. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Crane in his remarks asked why we needed to direct our minds to international influence in order to draft legislation in this area. It seems that he takes a contrary view to that put by Senator Newman this morning when she called on Senator Richardson to implement United Nations conventions.

It is therefore not possible for the Committee to set out to do what the terms of reference direct it to do, and `clarify' a right which does not exist.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the ACCI's view. I put this question to Mr Noakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you think there should be a right?</PARA>
<PARA>His response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think there should be, under the present industrial relations system that we have generally in this country. I do not think there should be a right to take industrial action with impunity, and I say that in respect of employees and employers. We must not forget that we have a rather peculiar system. It is the only system of its type in the industrialised world. Both through the operation of the common law and statute law, there has not been given any degree of immunity from the consequences of industrial action.</PARA>
<PARA>I then asked a further question of Mr Noakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not asking you in the context of what you have written there, because you do say that. I am asking you if you believe there should be some right. Let me put it in the context of there being another industrial relations system&mdash;the one that you would prefer.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Noakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would prefer a system in which there was no compulsory arbitration, and in which there was no award system as we know it at the moment,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>No award system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but a voluntary system in which trade union membership was free and open and not restricted, in the way it is at the present time by statutory provisions, in the sense of freedom of choice. We would prefer a single, integrated system across the country, instead of the seven different systems which it seems are in a constant state of conflict with each other. Under that sort of system, which would be a bargaining system, as we see it&mdash;a true bargaining system, as is common in most countries of the world&mdash;we would see the need to revisit the packet of sanctions and the question of strike action or lockout action and to provide some degree of immunity in certain circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked Mr Noakes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do you believe those circumstances ought to be?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Noakes replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly, during the negotiation period for an agreement, when the parties were in the course of negotiating a fresh agreement&mdash;when their existing arrangements had expired&mdash;we would see the need for there to be some degree of immunity. But that is not unusual in a bargaining system and even, in some cases, in this country. It is true in Victoria, for example.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked him a question with respect to the degree. The representatives of a major employer group were unable, during the course of that process, to identify any degree of protection. Yet, they said they had a specific view of what type of industrial relations system they wanted. The major employer group in this country could not say what degree of protection workers would have to negotiate any arrangements in respect of their employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's term of reference (B) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What revisions to either the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Practices Act 1974</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Industrial Relations Act 1988</EMPHASIS> should be made in order to clarify a worker's right to withdraw labour and under what conditions such withdrawal may or may not be pursued . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the committee found, as it did throughout, that the current Trade Practices Act and sections 45D and 45E were restrictive in allowing workers a right to protect conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, of some 206 cases that have occurred from 1977 through to 1 July of this year under sections 45D and 45E, the overwhelming majority related to primary and industrial action being taken by workers. In particular, of the 206 actions commenced, 81 injunctions were granted, even though those actions were primarily related to industrial action for the protection of working conditions and, in fact, jobs in many cases. Information that was provided to us by the Department of Industrial Relations in section 8.1 of the contents of a very large submission outlined all the 206 cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess I can speak with some degree of knowledge about sections 45D and 45E. As Senator Crane said, yes, I am the subject of an action by a company. That action arose out of the protection of workers' jobs. It took place as a result of the admission of a company that it intended to import paper for the very purposes of denying workers the right to take industrial action over certain changes that had taken place within the company that related very specifically to their terms and conditions of employment. Yet, the company never sought, during the course of the action being taken by the unions at the request of their members, to resolve anything through the industrial relations system. It took action after the event. Quite clearly, that is a very good example of sections 45D and 45E being used purely as a punitive measure&mdash;not to settle an industrial dispute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Term of reference (C) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether sections 45D&amp;E provide security in law for the legitimate rights of individuals, and small and large businesses, to have freedom in the movement of goods and services and to trade without interference.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is a very relevant point. In fact, that was the major intention of sections 45D and 45E in the first place. The intention was to provide protection; it is about trade and trade restrictions. But the majority of times the legislation has been used it has been used to crush workers and their rights in protecting their employment and employment conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that, Mr Howard, in his second reading speech back in 1977, said, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primary boycotts by employees are not, of course, dealt with by this Act.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that out of 206 actions commenced, the vast majority relate to primary actions relating to industrial matters. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondary boycotts by employees do, however, have some unique features. Accordingly, the Bill has some special provisions which are appropriate only to employee secondary boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where employees are taking action for a dominant purpose substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, termination of employment, hours of work or working conditions of those employees, or fellow employees of the same employer, the secondary boycott is not prohibited.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, if one looks through the case studies of all of the actions taken, the vast majority of those 206 cases, again, relate to those specific things. We should not lose sight of the fact that 81 injunctions were granted. So sections 45D and 45E have clearly been used as a punitive measure against workers and their legitimate pursuits to protect working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Term of reference (D) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether sections 45D&amp;E are a satisfactory means of preventing and settling disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>The majority report found that clearly they are not, and history has shown that to be the case. Quite frankly, in a lot of circumstances, sections 45D and 45E actions have exacerbated the cases. Senator Carr pointed out that, in many circumstances where businesses have been used as a front to run a sections 45D and 45E action by a major company, the smaller company has ended up going broke. Whether Mudginberri was sold to somebody else is beside the point. What Senator Crane did not say was that, if it had not been sold, it would have gone broke anyway. It was just used as a front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Term of reference (E) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent to which Sections 45D&amp;45E might unduly restrict civil liberties, particularly by way of impeding the legitimate exercise of protest action by citizens</PARA>
<PARA>Again, a number of actions have been taken against conservation groups and others to protect either the environment or buildings that have ultimately ended up being protected under other legislation. It was clearly found by the committee that that is the case&mdash;that it does restrict the civil liberties of people to take action. I have heard Senator O'Chee argue the case very strongly for civil liberties, particularly in China. I am quite sure that where we have a legitimate protest action, he will clearly defend the right of Australians to take it and not be subject of punitive measures by way of such legislation as it stands in sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the majority report of the committee clearly is correct. The sooner we look at the legislation that will come before this parliament the better. If those opposite knew anything about industrial relations they would not even be sitting here&mdash;the five wise monkeys! Quite frankly, they really do not understand the industrial relations system of this country. Since we came to office we have had the lowest level of industrial relations problems for 30 years. Where were those opposite in 1982? There were real problems then. We have taken industrial disputes to their lowest level for 30 years&mdash;in fact, probably in the history of this country. That is why we are going to make the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to deal with industrial relations matters where they should be dealt with, and they should be dealt with in the Industrial Relations Act. It does not deny the right of employers the opportunity to take action. If those opposite look at the way in which the legislation will be drafted, they will see that it does provide for very clear protection. It provides for protection for both parties and it is in the right area, and that is in the Industrial Relations Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Act will also be amended to reflect what it should truly reflect; that is, the trade between businesses where there is action being taken by certain companies against other companies. That is how it should be. We surely must protect the rights of employees and we surely must deal with them in the right area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Crane made strong comment about the evidence given being overwhelmingly in favour of maintaining sections 45D and 45E as they stand in the Trade Practices Act. I would have to say that a number of employer groups&mdash;one of them, in particular, being the Business Council of Australia&mdash;have said that if we had a more flexible labour market system we would not need sections 45D and 45E, and they were not the only ones who said it. </PARA>

The implementation of the majority recommendation to remove the secondary boycott provisions from the Trade Practices Act and to incorporate similar provisions in industrial relations legislation would, as we have been debating across the chamber for the last few minutes, simply entrench union power. It needs to be remembered that that is power that now represents less than 30 per cent of workers in the private sector. It would entrench the us and them mentality which has bedevilled industrial relations in this country for far too long.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence does sustain it. The fact is that employers do not race out and take out injunctions every day. They are not all that easy to obtain and they are certainly not inexpensive. Employers often stated to the committee that if you have reached for the use of this sanction, the situation is pretty explosive and confrontationist anyway. The single action of resorting to the use of the secondary boycott provisions is not likely to make much difference to the moods of the parties involved. Indeed, it was indicated in evidence that the use of such sanctions often has a very positive impact on the resolution of disputes because it does, indeed, lead to their resolution. Employers are not encouraged by their own organisations, such as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, to race out and take out such an application. They are, as I said, usually remedies of final recourse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the impact of sections 45D and 45E on the individual's exercise of individual rights, particularly as lauded in International Labour Organisation conventions, such security already exists in Australia and is not circumscribed by the secondary boycott provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the matter of individual and particular freedoms and personal rights which currently exist or may exist in Australian law is an area for the Australian Parliament, nationally, and Australian state parliaments to address and make decisions about, not necessarily a matter for international conventions. Both sections 45D and 45E concern the prevention of illegal boycotts which interfere with the ability of businesses to trade and go about lawful activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trade unions have long campaigned to obtain a repeal of these sections. Their own protector, and indeed enhancer of union power, this Keating Labor government, supports them. Both seem blind to the fact that such action may financially cripple companies, thus resulting in company closures and significant loss of jobs. In fact, a repeal of these provisions has been attempted at least twice by the Labor government, in 1984 and 1987. Sensibly, the Democrats did not support the proposals in 1984 and, with our opposition to them very clear, that legislation was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the latter example, 1987, the Labor government attempted to seriously delay employer access to the remedies and prevent use of most aspects of the common law tort injunction. But on deciding to call an early election in 1987, it abandoned these proposals in the face of enormous public opposition which threatened its re-election. Now, of course, with another election safely out of the way, Labor clearly believes that it can fly directly in the face of public opinion which is so opposed to these moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other avenues of industrial legislation, the Labor government has lent its great weight to assist trade unions at the expense of the greater national interest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was referring to this potential Transport Workers Union strike in Tasmania where, in the circumstances, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association issued a statement alerting members to record their milk losses and a threat to prosecute under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. As a direct result of that, the drivers did not strike. So again this provision protected a very important industry from disruptive and costly industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such examples serve to reinforce that a weakening of protection from these sections could very well inflict irreparable and serious damage on Australian businesses and the Australian economy overall, and consolidate an increase in union power as a consequence. In addition, as is obvious from evidence from the Australian Chamber of Shipping to the inquiry, real and harmful economic problems would result from a weakening of both sections. It referred to the $415 million invested into the waterfront reform process by both industry and by taxpayers through this government's funding of that reform process, and indicated that that process could be severely jeopardised by continual disruption between tugboats and waterfront labour, often costing some ships up to $30,000 a day. The government ought to know that efficient and effective ports, waterfront and shipping sectors are absolutely crucial to enhancing Australia's export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pioneer Concrete also provided evidence that reinforced the value of retaining sections 45D and 45E in the Trade Practices Act. A dispute there involved Pioneer employed lorry drivers and Ibis lorry owners. Pickets were withdrawn and industrial action ceased when Pioneer commenced proceedings under section 45D. Effectively, the Ibis drivers were attempting to prevent Pioneer employees from engaging in Pioneer's own cartage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government in the current financial year allocated over $10 1/2 million to the Trade Union Training Authority. Some of this money at least ought to be put to good use by being spent on educating employees and union members of their own obligations, responsibilities and liabilities under the law. It is clear that many trade union members or officials have little or no meaningful understanding of the Trade Practices Act, or indeed of sections 45D and 45E of that act&mdash;or, if they do understand it, they certainly have little respect for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major thrust of the majority report is incorrect. Employer preference for 45D and 45E has no relation to the ineffectiveness of arbitration because it is a secondary action; the use of these secondary boycott provisions is a secondary action, not a primary one. Boycott provisions are useful tools of arbitration and resolution. Boycott action must be curtailed and employers given a remedy which is effective, immediate and responsible, both for the company and for those who derive an interest from its continuing operation, whether they be company employees who have secure employment or shareholders who derive an income from their investment in the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country simply cannot afford to leapfrog into expanding trade union power given that at present, as I said earlier, less than 30 per cent of Australians working in the private sector are trade union members.

Should this happen, not only will businesses and companies suffer, but the secure employment of thousands of employees will be placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that even the language used in the Labor government's working paper on legislative reform detailing proposed changes to the Industrial Relations Act strongly reinforces a divisive spirit rather than a conciliatory one. The use of the word `target' in that paper, to refer to a business or company with which a union was dealing, does not augur well for the future of industrial relations, trade practices or the long term economic wellbeing of this country. It portends a churlish and immature attitude to negotiation and conciliation and constructs a difficult path for all parties to tread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will reinforce the points I have made by quoting from the Crawford report, which was commissioned by the Fraser coalition government in the late 1970s and which emphasised the many opportunities within the grasp of Australian industry. Though it is around 15 years old now, it clearly has a solid shelf life. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The choice is clear. Australia can attempt to preserve past patterns and attitudes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that event, Australia is likely to continue to slip down the table of world living standards. In these circumstances, unemployment at quite high levels might be a long-term problem.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that not exactly what we have seen under a decade of Labor government, which has attempted in many respects, but most particularly in the field of industrial relations, to preserve past patterns and attitudes? Clearly, we have not really learnt from the last decade of lost and squandered opportunity under Labor. The fact that this government is seeking to return industrial relations and trade practices to a battleground forum with its current views on this issue is not without significance in the light of that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless both employer and employee groups see industrial conflict resolution clearly, without recourse to crippling and disabling legislative changes, Australia is destined for international industrial insignificance. To conclude, I can do no better than to quote from the submission to this inquiry from Mr John White, Managing Director of Delta Hydraulics in Tasmania, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industrial relations system in Australia has resulted in a `them and us' culture which is the backbone of the union movement. They are doing whatever they possibly can to maintain this culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The future for Australia is the removal of the them and us culture, a total change in management philosophy to create a new structure in Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The company structure that is based on power and subordination, manager and subordinate must in time be replaced with mutual understanding and responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This can be done with the development of a shared vision of where the company is positioning itself for the future but we need to maintain the protection from those outside our company who do not share our vision. Sections 45D and 45E provide some of that protection.</PARA>
<PARA>In proposing to remove sanctions against secondary boycotts from the Trade Practices Act, this Keating Labor government is setting its face against the transformation of industrial relations in Australia into a cooperative enterprise-based system&mdash;a system which this country desperately needs. This system is essential if we are going to optimise our economic performance and provide jobs for those whom unions seem to represent least of all&mdash;the one million unemployed created by this government's inept policies and inept management. </PARA>

I think that is a good thing, as do people in the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time there was a pre-negotiated agreement, called the accord, between the unions and the Australian Labor Party. That accord was made public during the election. On that basis, among other good policies, the Labor Party was elected. That has resulted, as everyone knows&mdash;or certainly could not argue against&mdash;in redirecting quite a lot of money, in terms of wages, to profits of companies, which ran into billions of dollars over time. It resulted in a fairly big reduction in wage claims. That cannot be denied, given that on some occasions wages went up as much as $30 in a year. It cannot be argued against. The facts are there. It is very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that one has to look at the merit of each piece of legislation. I have a bias towards the trade union movement. I guess I could get quite excited about those who would oppose it and try to take away from it its right to defend its members. I do not know that that would do much good in a debate that should be rational. I suggest that we do not want a situation in which we have a chance to revert to depending only on the law to regulate and to deal with industrial problems. We did that in the last century, and the Tolpuddle Martyrs were sent to Australia because they dared to get together and ask for a shilling a week increase, I think it was, from the farmers for whom they worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows&mdash;it is clearly on the record&mdash;that, in the main, over the years the law has been directed to protecting property rather than individuals. I know we have come a long way. There has been quite a shift in that direction and now there are laws which protect individuals. I think that is a good thing. I believe that we should nurture that idea and protect people's rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions were developed in an act which talked about commerce. It was not really intended to look at or to regulate industrial matters; rather, it talked about commerce in terms of competition. People in commerce believe in competition. They talk about `no regulation' and `free competition'. The trade unions do not. They always try to maintain some equality for people who are paid a wage to produce goods or services. We do not suggest that because people have blue eyes they should get an extra $5 a week. We suggest that for a job done everyone should get a reasonable wage and a reasonable set of working conditions. The way the trade unions operate and the way business operates in seeking a profit are quite different. At no stage were these provisions suitable for determining industrial matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people think that on a really important issue, one which is fundamental to the trade union movement, any provision in the law will stop it defending the rights of its members, if they think there are enough police in this country, or that the army is big enough, to stop it moving to protect that position, they are quite mistaken. </PARA>

There would have to be government action to try to redress that in some way through the social wage. The report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training talks about disaffection with section 45D and 45E arising from a number of considerations. It says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that it is wholly inappropriate that sections 45D&amp;E of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Trade Practices</EMPHASIS> legislation should be used in relation to industrial disputes, and that industrial legislation should be the core mechanism for resolution of industrial disputes.</PARA>

<PARA>Many people hide behind 45D and 45E so that they do not have to negotiate meaningfully. This is not new. For a long time the penalty provisions in the act and the penalty provisions that affect federal awards in this country suppressed trade union activity. People would be called into the arbitration court and asked whether they were on strike. They were never asked what the strike was about, whether there was any reason for it, or whether it could be negotiated; they were asked whether they were on strike. If they said yes, they could be found guilty and fined quite large amounts each day of that dispute. They did not get to the bottom of it or try to solve it. That approach never solved anything. We saw what happened with the O'Shea matter. Those legislative provisions were never used again. People who in other cases would normally have negotiated meaningfully did not negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in passing to an example in Queensland. For many years, the National Party government banned marching, unless those who wished to march went to the inspector who was in charge of traffic and put in a submission to do so.

They had the opportunity to appeal, but the outcome of the appeal was determined by that person, who was hardly about to reverse his decision. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Labor government was elected in Queensland, people have felt very little need to march on particular issues&mdash;probably because they have good government. They now have the right to march, but they have not done so. There is no division in the community. The matter has been dealt with by proper reason, government and legislation. I suggest that we take a lesson from that. We should look at it and say, `Let's move sections 45D and 45E into the Industrial Arbitration Act'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who suggests that the giving of three days to try to resolve a dispute industrially&mdash;three days would be a national disaster&mdash;is being mischievous.

During the many years that I was a trade unionist, I met many such managers. Giving that example and creating trust through providing information to the workers and the people who represent them can transmit into support.

Will it lead to increased investment and more jobs and incomes for our young people in the future?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only from the expansion of existing businesses or the starting up of new businesses&mdash;which is what investment is all about&mdash;that new jobs will be created. The answer is unequivocally that the majority recommendations of this report, if implemented, will have a deleterious effect on investment, the expansion of business in Australia and, hence, on jobs. It will certainly discourage investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already we have been told that the government, in its announcements about the industrial relations package, is proposing to weaken the boycott provisions that are currently in the Trade Practices Act. The critical thing that the government is proposing is a 72-hour period before one can seek injunctive relief from a boycott. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main point about section 45D and section 45E of the Trade Practices Act is that the threat of action against secondary boycotts has been more important as a deterrent than the actual implementation of these sections of the law. In other words, the law now prevents undesirable events without recourse to legal remedies. It is a good preventive measure. Therefore, these sections act as deterrents, which is what we want; we do not want people appearing before the courts. The evidence that was placed before this committee is quite unequivocal: these sections act as an effective deterrent in the business community against unfair boycott action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report is really about the government's intention to increase union power. In Australia, we need economic growth. It has been quite clear for many years now that what is required&mdash;it has even been enunciated by many government ministers&mdash;is a freeing up of the markets within Australia, the lowering of costs and our being internationally competitive in everything that we do. We need more competition in every market, particularly in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prosperity certainly comes from healthy, active competition. In recognition of this, the Labor government commissioned this year a major report on competition by Professor Hilmer. The Hilmer report was tabled only a few weeks ago, and it is very interesting. I will from quote page 42 of that report under the title of `Boycotts':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the secondary boycott provisions is currently the subject of a Senate Inquiry. On the basis of submissions received by this Inquiry, the Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Hilmer committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has not been persuaded of the need to amend the current provisions dealing with boycotts.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, an independent inquiry into what direction the government should be pursuing with regard to competition in general terms has looked at the same evidence and reached a quite different conclusion from the majority report. This shows quite clearly that the majority report of this committee has been basically a political decision; hence the importance of the minority report, which basically sets out the true facts of the evidence placed before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of other key points arose from the Hilmer committee. Page 43 of the Hilmer report states this about overseas approaches:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International experience indicates support for prohibiting boycotts through competition or industrial relations policy.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Hilmer agrees with the policy that is here in Australia. The report then talks about the US, New Zealand, the UK and Canada. The prime conclusion of this section on boycotts is on page 46 of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee did not receive any compelling evidence supporting reform of the primary or secondary boycott provisions, which appear broadly consistent with overseas practice. In these circumstances, the Committee does not propose any amendment to the current provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>So another committee that has been set up by the Labor government to give it advice about which way it should go has looked at exactly the same evidence and come to a conclusion that is identical to the conclusion of the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not worrying about the actions of responsible unions. That is not a concern. We agree with what Senator Burns said before. We are about working together; we all have to do that in order to be competitive and to succeed. There is absolutely no future for confrontation and the old style of `them and us'. Effective competition within Australia and in the world is the key to making that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the law currently does under sections 45D and 45E is an effective deterrent to unreasonable union behaviour. The submissions and the evidence given to the committee have been excellent and comprehensive. I commend the minority report to the Senate.

So markets were developed in places like Britain, France, Italy, Holland, Belgium and so on.

There were ten carriers&mdash;two new ones, purchased out of Japan, and the others existing carriers from a fleet. The only way this could work, because of the distances involved, was to take ore from either the Bowen basin or the Pilbara to Europe and then, on the way back, pick up oil.

In the end, notwithstanding the fact that the original intent was to purchase vessels to have a predictable freight rate between Australia and Europe, the company sold the whole lot. It sold the ships simply because the freight rates around the world became cheaper. It had nothing to do with the unions or sections 45D and E. I have often looked back on that and thought to myself, `Here was an opportunity'. Agreements were reached at the same time&mdash;this was very difficult&mdash;for partial shipments out of the Pilbara to go on those ships to Japan. This is notwithstanding the fact that when the Japanese enter into long-term agreements they have back to back agreements with their own shipping companies&mdash;mainly crewed by the Koreans, I might mention as an aside. Yet we were able to get that little niche in there back in the 1970s. The thing that distresses me is that that was a great opportunity lost because of the militancy of the trade union movement, specifically the Seamen's Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Gibson mentioned the Hilmer report, which I will touch on briefly. Professor Hilmer said that the committee&mdash;I know this has been quoted before&mdash;did not get any compelling evidence supporting the reform of the primary or secondary boycott provisions. In regard to secondary boycotts, he went on to say, `In fact what we did find was that in every country there are provisions against this sort of action'. When Senator Carr talked about this matter, he gave the history&mdash;going back to 1983 or thereabouts&mdash;of the attempts by the trade union movement to remove sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act. There have been attempts by the unions to do this, simply to make them more powerful. I have already mentioned that sections 45D and 45E have never really been used much, but they sit there as a very important deterrent. If it were not for that deterrent, there would have been a lot more disputation. Earlier one of my colleagues remarked that these sections of the act have prevented disputes ending up in the courts and going on and on. That is entirely correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, I support the minority report. I have been on committees like this before. Every time I see a majority report which does not reflect the weight of logic and the weight of evidence given by people to that committee, but rather reflects the political opinions of the majority, I think it is a great disservice to this place. It was never the intention of Senate standing committees to do that. If this sort of thing continues, people will ask why it is worth spending all that time and all that money preparing evidence to bring before a committee when the result is known before the first witness gives evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said it was not the first time this has happened. The last time this happened to me&mdash;I was not on this committee&mdash;was when I was a member of the committee that inquired into the third runway in Sydney. We took evidence for more than six months. The overwhelming evidence was to build that third runway and build it fast. The majority report by the Labor Party recommended that the third runway not be built. I can remember saying to Senator Collins&mdash;a humble backbencher in those days&mdash;`I never expected that you would sign your name to a dishonest report'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Parer said that the weight of logic is in favour of the minority report. That would mean that sections 45D and 45E would remain in the trade practices legislation. It might be interesting to see why it is logical to have sections 45D and 45E in an act which, apart from the provisions of those particular sections, deals with the marketplace in goods and services&mdash;an act which has two main purposes: the encouragement of competition in the marketplace and consumer protection. Those two very laudable aims are aimed at fairness of contract, fairness of dealings between competitors who produce goods and services, and fairness of dealings between consumers and those who provide them with the goods and services they consume.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an illustration of how, unfortunately, the provisions of this act, as they presently stand, operate. The Odco case relied on sections 45D and 45E. That case was taken through to its conclusion and a finding was made against the two unions&mdash;the BWIU and another union. The full title of that case was the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia and Others v. Odco Pty Ltd. In the first instance the case was heard by Mr Justice Woodward. The unions appealed that decision and it was then heard by Mr Justice Wilcox, Mr Justice Burchett and Mr Justice Ryan of the Full Court of the Federal Court. In the Full Court the Justices said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Honour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this refers to Mr Justice Woodward&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">also found that the rates of pay offered to its workers were adjusted unilaterally each year by Troubleshooters without consultation with the workers who were nevertheless advised of each adjustment shortly before or immediately after it occurred.</PARA>
<PARA>This case dealt with workers who had their rates of pay unilaterally adjusted each year. The point was that the workers were not receiving wages but remuneration as independent contractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very liberal interpretation of `independent contractors' when the people who are supposed to be independent contractors accept an offer made to them by the agent Troubleshooters and then do not have the ability to seek better conditions or better wages. This was a situation where sections 45D and 45E were used to protect a system where workers were given wages each year at the determination of Troubleshooters without any assistance from the unions and where, in theory if not in practice, the workers could be treated in a most shameful way. When some protest was made to stop that system continuing, even though at that stage it may have been continuing with the approval of some&mdash;but not all&mdash;of those employed by Troubleshooters, and attempts were made to change the system, the law stepped in and stopped that happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem with the way sections 45D and 45E presently operate. They do not operate in the interests of employees. They do not operate in the interests of workers. They operate in the interests of commerce. The interests of commerce are taken to transcend any concern for the conditions of workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is understood in section 45D. There is a provision in that section which gives some weight to the fact that people might be taking action in an attempt to get better wages and conditions. But section 45E does not contain that protection. We have a system that operates on a basis that is hostile to the sorts of things that workers might want to obtain, such as fair wages, proper conditions, reasonable time off and other provisions that the government says make things acceptable for the people who produce the wealth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the underlying concepts of 45D and 45E are in their very nature hostile to the sorts of things that workers need, then it is proper that they should be taken out of that act. If some protection is needed for employers, then that should be provided in some other way. The majority report on the operation of sections 45D and 45E makes a great contribution not only to the workers of this country but also to the general way this society performs. It would be a very backward step if the approach recommended in this report were not accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with sections 45D and 45E is that they are built on the concepts of free trade which ignore the great social, cultural and fairness concepts of how people should be treated in the workplace. All section 45E is concerned with is the protection of trade and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That comes directly from the common law system which we inherited from England. England passed awful legislation in 1798 and 1800, the combinations acts, which punished workers who simply struck in a desperate attempt to get better conditions. It was an offence, punishable by imprisonment for up to three months, for people to join together to obtain an increase in wages, a reduction in hours of work or a decrease in the rate of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that that is the situation today, but I do say that the philosophy that gave birth to the Combinations Act and the provisions of the common law, as they then operated, are the concepts behind 45D and 45E.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in front of us this evening the motion to adopt those recommendations moved by the then chair, our former colleague Senator Pat Giles, who for many years was a most competent and charming chairman of the Senate privileges committee. Following her initial speech and the circulation of the report, during the last sitting week significant contributions were made in the debate on the motion by Senator Cooney, my very good colleague across the chamber, and then, when we had determined the 42nd report, a member of the Senate Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Senator Cooney's eloquent, very careful and sincere speech was towards the minority report which he alone  wrote and signed as one member of the seven members who make up the Privileges Committee. His speech sets out his case. Even more comprehensively, it is set out in the text of the minority report that all senators have received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other contribution made in the debate in the last sitting week was from my colleague Senator Short, who had some informants with regard to some elements arising from the Senate committee's report which Senator Short felt incumbent to bring to the Senate. So, based upon the information that he had received, he raised a number of concerns again best understood in the terms of Senator Short's own speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following those two speeches and following a private conference with me, Senator McMullan adjourned the debate. I rose seeking leave only to make a brief statement. I said at that time, and I reiterate it now, that it was appropriate, given the degree of dissent that was expressed by Senator Short and, of course, the quite well-known views of Senator Cooney on a quite different matter, that these speeches ought to be able to be considered by all senators&mdash;indeed by anyone in the public&mdash;so that when we came to conclude the debate, as I expect we will do now, all of those matters could be taken into full consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also said in that brief statement in the last sitting week that, on the basis of the two speeches I have referred to, I was not moved in any way to accept or change in any way the findings or the recommendations of the Senate report, which I fully support. I am still very confident that the six majority members of the Senate Committee of Privileges still support those findings in exactly the form that we had determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I come now to make some remarks mostly with regard to the new material that Senator Short introduced in his speech. But first I must refer to my good friend Senator Cooney. Senator Cooney is foreshadowing an amendment to the motion that is before us. His amendment is exactly to achieve the minority report that he wrote in conclusion. Again, like his speech in the last sitting week, there is nothing at all surprising about Senator Cooney's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It happens to be the case that Senator Cooney's minority position was very well known to the individual members of the privileges committee, that is, the other six out of seven who had been through all of the items of correspondence and all of the submissions, and who had attended every minute of the public hearings, which had been considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were evaluating the submissions and hearings on this quite important matter, Senator Cooney was very conscientious in putting his own personal position, which only in this respect disagreed with the majority. I am not trespassing on the confidence of our committee discussions to say that all of the rest of us carefully considered Senator Cooney's views, both as verbally given by him and as eventually given in a draft written form and we did not subscribe to his individual view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Rather, we took the view that there were two officers of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters, who were seen by the ASC&mdash;their employer&mdash;as being the responsible officers in this action. They were both named in our finding, along with their employer, the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn quickly to Senator Short's statements. The matters raised by Senator Short in mitigation of the behaviour of Mr Ron Trevethan do not challenge the factual basis of the committee's findings. Senator Short's speech reiterates an explanation of behaviour which the committee took into account before making the findings that it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Short and his informants appear to have misunderstood what the committee has found. He said that the view the committee has put is misconceived. The committee did not find that Mr Trevethan intended to commit contempt. Rather, the committee found that Mr Trevethan, by laying a charge of misconduct, intended to perform an act which had the effect of penalising Mr Gaffey as a consequence of his giving evidence before a parliamentary committee. The committee, in determining that no penalties should be recommended, explicitly stated in paragraph 2.62 that the officers concerned:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . did not advert to the consequences of their actions in terms of parliamentary privilege and protection of witnesses before committees.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the privilege resolutions, the committee is required, after determining findings to be included in its report and before presenting the report, to acquaint the person or persons affected by the findings with the findings. Persons are then able to make submissions on the findings. The committee interprets this requirement broadly so that any adverse comment, and any comment explaining the findings, are forwarded to the persons adversely affected. The committee did this; the committee received the final submissions of those people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate should note two important matters of fact. First, the Australian Securities Commission, before the committee's comments and findings were made known to it, accepted responsibility on behalf of the commission and on behalf of the two `senior officers of the commission who were directly involved in the laying of charge F'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> It was only in its final written submission, which presumably is the submission to which Senator Short has referred, that any attempt was made to spread responsibility among other officers and to exclude the two officers concerned from the finding of contempt. The submission was included in a volume of documents tabled with the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, in determining its findings that individual officers should be held responsible, the committee had extensive discussions as to whether the organisation as a whole should take exclusive responsibility for its actions. The committee concluded that it should not do so, for the reasons discussed at paragraphs 2.13 to 2.17 of its report, both before and after taking into account the written submission of the ASC made to the committee after it had determined findings to be included in its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third observation is that this report, our 42nd, is the first occasion on which the Committee of Privileges has joined an authority in the responsibility for the actions of its officers. On all other occasions, including the only other time when the committee has found that a contempt has been committed, the committee has made findings on the actions of individuals rather than the organisations as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to some unfortunate misstatements of fact in Senator Short's remarks. First, he said that charge F, on which the committee has made the findings of contempt, was initiated by the Australian Government Solicitor. This is not true. While the committee was unable to conclude on the evidence which of Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters suggested the inclusion of charge F in the list of charges, and thus made no comment in its report on which one of these two officers was responsible for initiating the charge, it is clear that it was raised in discussions between them before advice was sought from the Australian Government Solicitor. This is detailed in paragraph 1.38, including relevant <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> references. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second misstatement of fact was when Senator Short said that Mr Trevethan, when he was advised of the contempt implications:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . eight days after the charge [F] was laid . . . apologised and caused it to be withdrawn. The other five charges remained standing.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not true. In addition, charge C was withdrawn by letter from Mr Trevethan to Mr Gaffey eight days after it was laid, at the same time as charge F was withdrawn, without comment or explanation. It would be interesting to know the form of this `apology' and to whom it was made at that time. It was not made to Mr Gaffey and it was not brought to the committee's attention that there had been such an apology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third misstatement of fact was that Senator Short said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee [of Privileges] has made an example of Mr Trevethan to encourage the others. That is what the privileges committee report said.</PARA>
<PARA>This also is not true. The committee's report does not say that. The finding of contempt stands on its own. The committee has gone on to make general comments which have led to the recommendation contained in subparagraph 3 of paragraph 3.7 of its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fourth matter, which is also a misstatement of fact, was that Senator Short said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unintended contempt implication of that charge [F] was appreciated almost immediately.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not literally true. The chairman of the ASC became aware of the charge and its implications when he was advised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, following Mr Gaffey's raising the matter with that committee. Mr Gaffey claims that he had apprised Mr Trevethan of contempt implications soon after the charge was laid, but that this had not led to an `immediate' withdrawal. It took the intervention of the parliament's committee to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth point of misstatement was that Senator Short said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He [Mr Trevethan] also appreciated and acted at all times in accordance with the Public Service regulations, which are not framed with these circumstances [i.e. witness protection, rights of public servants, etc.] in mind.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not literally true. Mr Trevethan, as a senior manager, could be expected to have access to all relevant documents and guidelines relating to public servants, notably the publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Guidelines for Conduct of Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, as an officer of a regulatory authority with a direct relationship with a parliamentary committee, Mr Trevethan should have been expected to have better than normal knowledge of rights and duties of public servants in this regard. While the authority takes responsibility for not educating its managers appropriately, there is a duty on individual public service managers to inform themselves of at least the rudiments of their legal responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally&mdash;and this the sixth point&mdash;it is interesting that Senator Short, on behalf of Mr Trevethan, has pleaded that no `additional' penalty should be imposed. As the committee has specifically recommended that no penalty should be imposed by the Senate on the organisation or individuals, I am left to conclude that the persons affected now regard a finding of contempt as a penalty additional to the laying of the charge; a view with which the committee agrees, as noted in its report in paragraph 2.62. It is perhaps a pity that the persons who laid the charge against a witness before a parliamentary committee, which subsequently led to the committee's findings, did not similarly regard such a charge as a penalty. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32.In deciding to lay charges against Mr Gaffey, I was not seeking to be vindictive, nor to impose a penalty on him: I simply believed that, once my authority as the manager of the Victorian Regional Office had been challenged, I had to take the next logical step to assert that authority.

The vast majority of cases can be put into two categories: firstly, the right of ordinary Australians to reply to statements made in the parliament; and, secondly, most importantly, and applying to this case, the right of parliament to protect its own witnesses. The protection of witnesses who appear before Senate committees is vital to guarantee basic human rights and to give ordinary people the right to have their two bobs' worth of opinion expressed without fear and without penalty. We are only as strong as the ability of those people to come before Senate committees and have their say. I think that is important because it applies in this very case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately in this case, Senator Short has accepted the Trevethan side of the argument and that forces me to go into some detail of the evidence. While I support what Senator Teague has said, I think I have to say things in a much sharper way than would otherwise be necessary to deny the situation that has arisen where Mr Gaffey has been put on trial. I accept that Senator Short has raised this like any of us would&mdash;a constituent makes a complaint or tells us a story and we articulate that story. Unfortunately, it is wrong, as Senator Teague has pointed out, and it is particularly wrong when one looks at paragraph 2.34 of our report which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the effects of laying the charge are unlikely to be serious is because of the action taken by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities, by Senators responding to matters raised by Mr Gaffey after that Committee's report was tabled, by the Senate in referring the matters to this Committee, and by the Committee of Privileges in undertaking this inquiry and reaching the present conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what clearly happened is not as Senator Short said; in fact, it was because of the actions taken by the Senate committee that the matter was withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short's strident defence of Mr Trevethan is summed up by his comments in the debate on the report of the privileges committee on 30 September. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having heard from some of those involved and understanding the chronicle of events, I have come to be strongly of the opinion that Mr Trevethan was and is innocent of any intent to hold this Senate in contempt&mdash;that his endeavours to administer his office in a wholly appropriate manner inadvertently led to his becoming involved in this way.</PARA>
<PARA>I regret that, because of statements like that, I have to explore more sharply Mr Trevethan's role in this matter. I would have preferred to leave the carefully crafted report to stand alone. Mr Trevethan's conduct, to quote the committee, was not appropriate. On page 22 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . officers within the Victorian Regional Office had at least left themselves open to criticism of their inept personnel and management practices and inadequate record-keeping.</PARA>
<PARA>More seriously, on page 40 it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that officers at such a senior level of an organisation with a direct relationship with a parliamentary committee should have been aware of parliamentary privilege and contempt. Therefore the Committee would not normally regard lack of knowledge in these circumstances as warranting mitigation of penalty. The Committee considers, however, that the public exposure of the officers' limited understanding of the parliamentary aspects of the legislative framework within which they were operating, and the embarrassing details of the administration of the Victorian Regional Office, is in itself a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I put it more bluntly: here we have a senior legally trained officer, with a direct relationship between a parliamentary committee and his commission, pleading ignorance as an excuse. Tell that to all the company directors of Australia who deal with the Australian Securities Commission. They would love to adopt such an excuse. Officers at a senior level of an organisation with a direct relationship with a parliamentary committee should have been aware of parliamentary privilege. </PARA>

The speech was made in an attempt to exonerate Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters, the Regional Commissioner and General Counsel respectively of the Victorian Regional Office of the ASC, from the contempt findings made against them by the Committee of Privileges (the Committee) in its 42nd Report.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.1 In October 1991, with the written permission of the Victorian Regional Commissioner of the ASC Mr Ron Trevethan, I participated in the presentation by a Law Institute Committee of a submission to an inquiry of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities (the Joint Committee). The submission was invited by the Joint Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.2 The submission I was involved in differed from the submission of the ASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.3 I was later charged by Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters with misconduct under the Public Service Act. The charges included the charge subject of the Committee's contempt findings, which was that I had given a submission to the Joint Committee which differed from that given by the ASC. The ASC ultimately withdrew all the charges.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the allegations are now being used in an attempt to exonerate the contempt, after the Committee had rejected Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters' previous defences.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Impact of Senator Short's speech</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.1 Senator Short's attempts to exonerate the conduct of Trevethan and Waters effectively re-penalises and injures me, and compounds the contempt. This occurs notwithstanding the withdrawal of the charge subject of the contempt, and the apology of Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.2 The attempted exoneration also does not deal with the fundamental issue of the rights of Parliament's witnesses to Parliament's protection, or the Committee's findings, (which I accept, even though I do not agree with all of them).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5:Tendency of Senator Short's information to negate ASC apologies and undermine the ASC Members' attempts to educate against contempt</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.1 I am concerned by the manner in which Senator Short's speech effectively negates the apology (seen by the Committee as a mitigating factor) extended to me by the ASC, Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters for laying the charge in contempt.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Impact of Senator Short's speech&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I must make the point here that there was a settlement of the dispute in the ASC; there was an apology by the chairman of the authority. Unfortunately, that settlement and that apology have been abrogated by the statement made by Senator Short. Of course, Senator Short is probably unconscious of the fact that, when he made that speech, he seriously disadvantaged Mr Gaffey. I do not have time to go through the details of Mr Gaffey's statement, but I commend it to honourable senators. It is unfortunate that a person who comes to this Senate seeking redress should become the victim and not be protected by the findings of the privileges committee of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, I cannot support the amendment moved by my colleague Senator Cooney. As far as I am concerned, Mr Trevethan and Ms Waters were joined together in their actions throughout the case. The ASC and its lawyers did not seek to separate them; nor did Ms Waters seek to separate herself at any point. So, from my point of view, I do not think there is any question that the whole picture is one in which Ms Waters&mdash;I quite accept she had a slightly lesser role than Mr Trevethan&mdash;has been joined with Mr Trevethan, and only at the 11th hour did the authority try to take to itself the responsibility of the two officers. So I cannot support the amendment. I ask honourable senators to support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry by the Select Committee on Superannuation into the  Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund had its origins in an MPI debate late last year. During that debate Senator Kernot raised her concerns about the goings-on in that fund during the years from 1986 to 1991. Interestingly, neither the persons she named nor the organisations to which she referred elected to exercise their right of reply under the standing orders of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot then raised the matter with the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. That committee, which had received a submission from a member of the union's governing council, properly used its adverse evidence procedures to write to those four persons named as illegal beneficiaries of the extraordinary withdrawals seeking their response. To the best of its ability, and to the best of the evidence available, the committee has got to the bottom of the QPOASF operation. The committee has not taken political sides. It could easily have slipped into this mode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here are the facts as exposed in this detailed report. The four beneficiaries&mdash;Mr Martindale, Mr Rutherford, Mr Daly and Ms Kinder&mdash;were given access to their superannuation funds when the trust deed barred such access. To obtain access, they had to resign from the service of either the QPOA or the QPOA Credit Union. None of them did this. To legitimise this access, the trustees made a retrospective amendment to the trust deed. As they had not resigned, they had to get the authorised signing officer&mdash;who, according to witnesses at the hearings, was Ms Kinder&mdash;to sign that they were resigning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amazingly, the committee could not obtain a copy of the four benefit request forms, or BRFs. They have been either lost, given back to other agencies, or not copied. The QPOASF had no record. The NML had no record&mdash;and it was the administrator. The Cooke inquiry did not keep these records&mdash;although it kept other records; it returned them to the NML, which, of course, has no record of the forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate to make its own conclusions about the conduct of those who signed the benefit forms and whether they had an interest in deceiving the fund administrators into paying the benefits. I also invite the Senate to consider whether persons involved in one or a number of those agencies entrusted with the BRFs had an interest in ensuring that the forms were lost or unable to be tendered as evidence to the superannuation inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case amply demonstrates the need for reform of superannuation funds and the legislation which governs their operations. In this case, the Commonwealth was powerless to do anything about the wrongful conduct of the QPOASF trustees. The Queensland government could have done something. It did not. Perhaps it will. Over to the Attorney-General!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the SIS legislation is passed, the ISC will have the power to intervene and properly protect superannuation funds. The only way that members of the QPOASF could have acted to bring the trustees to account was to go to the Queensland Supreme Court with a swag of lawyers&mdash;we even had a QC attend our hearings&mdash;and sue for a breach of trustee fiduciary duty, which is a costly and time consuming process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the inquiry is that the committee exposed the wrongful actions of the trustees and the wrongdoings regarding the BRFs. The committee has recommended that the Queensland government investigate the loss of the documents. The committee has identified principles which it will use to test the superannuation industry supervisory legislation when it considers that package of bills in coming weeks. The committee has shown that persons will go to enormous lengths to cover up a trail of evidence which shows wrongdoing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems could have been solved if those who had received overpayments exceeding a total of $30,000 had simply written out a cheque and paid the overpayment back to the fund. They could still right their wrong. Instead, the result has been three inquiries: the Senate inquiry; the Cooke inquiry, which was aborted; and the Towers Perrin review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of dollars have been channelled into the coffers of the Queensland legal profession to erect a barrier to prevent the committee and the public finding out the truth. The QPOA and the QPOA Credit Union have expended members' funds to the tune of $34,000 in ensuring that the superannuation fund is properly funded. Investigating the deficiency in the Towers Perrin report cost $20,000. Legal costs are estimated to be in excess of $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, where are we now in this sorry affair? The committee chair, Senator Watson, has forwarded a copy of the report to the Queensland Attorney-General, Dean Wells, advising him of the relevance of the recommendations to the administration of justice in Queensland. To my knowledge, the report has been received&mdash;at least, it has been debated in the Queensland parliament by the opposition&mdash;but the minister has not responded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wells, this chamber needs to know the answers to the following questions. Is it your intention to ignore a multipartisan report on the QPOASF affair? Are you not concerned that documents may have been lost in order to evade the processes of the law and the search for the truth? Are you satisfied with your government's policy on archiving, or is it your view that documents can be selectively archived to ensure that certain matters are not allowed to be placed in the spotlight of truth? If you choose to ignore these questions, then yet again, the task of ensuring honest conduct in public affairs in Queensland will be left to a small group of beleaguered individuals, such as Mr O'Neill and Mr Lindeberg, who took great personal risk in initiating and appearing before the Senate inquiry. Mr Wells, I am sure that I am not alone in my interest in hearing your response. I, therefore, appeal to your sense of fair play as the custodian of justice in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments of the Customs Tariff Act 1987. I will briefly outline the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections three to ten, thirteen to seventeen and subsection twelve two of this bill contain amendments which will remove from the principal act references to schedule five. This schedule contains the legislative means to administer quota restrictions on imported goods. As quota restrictions on textiles, clothing and footwear were abolished on the first of March 1993 and the administration of cheese and curd quotas has been transferred to schedule four by this bill, there is no requirement for the subject legislation. These changes will operate on and from fourteen days after this bill receives Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which will be introduced during these sittings, will amend the provisions governing the rules of origin for imported goods in the Customs Act 1901. Section eleven of this bill provides a consequential amendment to section eighteen of the principal act to cater for the changes to the rules of origin. This amendment will operate from the day that the new provisions take effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection twelve one and schedule six of this bill will operate on and from the first of July 1993. These changes give effect to the government's decision to reduce the coverage of the Australian System of Tariff Preferences (ASTP). This decision applies to chemicals, plastics, rubber and leather goods, sugar, textiles, clothing, footwear, fruit juice, canned food and dried fruit from countries listed in schedule one to the Customs Tariff Act, except Forum Island countries and fifty one countries and places identified by the United Nations as being least developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The list of countries affected by the change is shown in section twelve one of this bill. The developing country rates of duty for these goods have been fixed at the pre-first of July 1993 level until the general rate falls to that level. Thereafter the general rate of duty will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule one of this bill is operative on and from the first of January 1988 and provides a free rate of duty for needlecraft kits of heading 6308.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule three was operative between the thirteenth of October 1992 and the twenty-eighth of February 1993. It provided for the continued duty free importation of certain handkerchiefs under a concessional item in schedule four to the principal act. This provision was a short term measure, bridging similar concessions accorded by the tariff concession system prior to the thirteenth of October 1992 and the customs by-law system after the first of March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule four of this bill is operative on and from the first of March 1993. The Canadian margin of preference on certain carpets is being phased out following agreement between the Australian and Canadian governments. The Canadian rates of duty for these goods have been frozen at the pre-first of March 1993 level until the general rate falls to that level. Thereafter the general rate will apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, this schedule contains amendments to implement changes to the concessional arrangements for textiles, clothing and footwear in schedule four to the principal act. This follows an enquiry into the efficacy of the customs by-law system in relation to TCF goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule five contains amendments to recognise the newly created independent countries of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic. These changes accord the benefits of the Australian system of tariff preferences to the new countries and have effect from the tenth of March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule six is operative on and from the first of July 1993. The 1991 industry statement contained initiatives to assist local manufacturers of passenger motor vehicle components. These government initiatives exclude certain goods of a kind used as replacement components in passenger motor vehicles and which had a rate of duty of fifteen per cent on the first of July 1992, from the general phase down of tariff rates. The changes in this schedule implement that decision in relation to those goods imported from Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992 contained a rationalisation, operative from the first of July 1993, of tariff subheadings covering certain spirits and spirituous liquors of chapter twenty-two. The amendments in this schedule apply the February 1993 consumer price index adjustments to the newly rationalised subheadings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule also contains a reduction of 3.103 cents per litre in the customs duty on aviation gasoline. This portion of the duty collected on aviation gasoline was attributed to aviation authorities to perform services on behalf of the aviation industry. The reduction is a reflection of lower Commonwealth costs due to the transfer of aerodromes to local ownership and the direct levying of charges for services previously provided by Commonwealth agencies on aviation industry users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item fifty three in schedule four to the principal act was created to provide a phasing regime for certain goods which were not components for passenger motor vehicles but were encompassed by the passenger motor vehicle components initiatives. Under these initiatives the goods would have had a duty rate of fifteen per cent. The present amendment to split item fifty-three provides appropriate phasing rates of duty for these goods, some of which are subject to the government's decision to reduce the coverage of the Australian system of tariff preferences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule seven of this bill is operative on and from the fifth of July 1993 and amends the table to item fifty-three A to redefine those tariff subheadings excluded from claiming the concessions accorded by this item.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also contains a number of other minor technical and administrative changes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Summaries of the amendments contained in this bill have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill gives effect to the undertaking given in the Budget to introduce new measures to combat overservicing in the Medicare program, including pharmaceutical benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill represents the first instalment in a series of measures that will be taken by the Government to minimise abuse of Medicare. Further measures to deal with fraud and with audits, and to prevent "double-dipping" by visiting medical officers against public hospitals and Medicare benefits, will be implemented progressively. Legislation for new fraud measures is expected to be introduced into the Parliament by the end of the Budget Session.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Health Insurance Act outlined in this Bill reflect the outcome of a close consultative process with the Australian Medical Association (AMA). The AMA has played a key role in the development of the new measures and, in so doing, has demonstrated that it takes seriously its expressed belief that it has a duty to co-operate in ensuring that the public resources earmarked for health care are appropriately utilised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new measures in this Bill are necessary because the existing mechanisms for dealing with overservicing have come under question and have not been shown to be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strengthened professional review process in this legislation should not concern the vast majority of practitioners. However, it should cause those practitioners who misuse or deliberately abuse the current benefits arrangements to reflect on their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review process is not to be invoked lightly. It is the  Government's intention that no practitioner will be subjected to the review process until he or she has been seen by a Medical Adviser of the Health Insurance Commission. The practitioner is to be advised of the Commission's concerns about the practitioner's practice and given a chance to consider his or her position, which could include seeking the advice of his or her professional colleagues. Only if the practitioner's practice continues to cause concern will he or she be referred for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) found in its "Audit Report No. 17, 1992-93, Medifraud and Excessive Servicing: Health Insurance Commission" that Medical Services Committees of Inquiry, the current bodies responsible for dealing with excessive servicing, were not operating satisfactorily and needed to be strengthened.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO concluded that specific action needed to be taken to deal adequately with gross levels of overservicing. One of the principal complaints about the existing mechanisms for dealing with overservicing has been that they do little to discourage the provision or initiation of excessive services. They are not effective deterrents because, in many instances, the level of benefits recovered from practitioners has been totally eclipsed by the level of overservicing actually engaged in.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major factor in the inability to impose penalties commensurate with the extent of a practitioner's overservicing is the current lack of power to make decisions on the extent of overservicing on the basis of generalised evidence. At present judgements about overservicing can only be made on the basis of individual services, that is, recovery of benefits and the imposition of penalties can only be made in respect of each service separately determined to have been excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further criticism of the current overservicing detection arrangements relates to delays in finalising cases, including delays occasioned by practitioners under review declining to appear at hearings because existing penalties for non-attendance are insufficient to ensure attendance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Audit Office report suggests that the minimum requirement to make Medical Services Committees of Inquiry more effective are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">increasing the amount of repayment, and/or penalty, required to be paid by practitioners found to have engaged in excessive servicing to reflect more closely the actual extent of moneys involved;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">power for the Committees to access medical records;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">appointment of additional Committees to help reduce time delays;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">follow-up counselling to be taken by the chairpersons of the Committees; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">appointment of a full-time Manager to oversee the operations of Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the provisions contained in this Bill do not provide a continuing role for Medical Services Committees of Inquiry, they do address the Audit Office's views on what is required to make  dealing with excessive servicing more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the replacement of Medical Services Committees of Inquiry by Professional Services Review Committees. Whereas the basic composition of Committees of Inquiry remains constant regardless of the nature of the services that are the subject to examination, the composition of the Professional Services Review Committees will vary according to types of services that are subject to review. For example, the empanelling of a Committee to review the rendering or initiation of services by a specialist in a particular specialty, would be on the basis that the majority of the Committee would be specialists in the same specialty. This means that there should be little cause for a practitioner to question the Committee's competence to deal with the matters referred to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant change in the Bill is the replacement of the concept of "excessive servicing" with one of "inappropriate practice". Whereas excessive servicing is currently defined as the rendering or initiation of services not reasonably necessary for the adequate care of the patient, the concept of "inappropriate practice" goes further. It covers a practitioner engaging in conduct, in connection with the rendering or initiating of services, that is unacceptable to his or her professional colleagues generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another significant change is that the Bill provides for the application by Professional Services Review Committees of the findings from a statistically valid sample of services rendered or initiated by the practitioner under review, to the whole class of services that are of concern. This will constitute a far greater deterrent than the application of the current excessive servicing benefits repayments and penalties. The statistical procedure for making the necessary calculations has been developed on advice from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and protects adequately the rights of the practitioner under review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further important change lies in the penalty that will result from the refusal of a practitioner to attend a hearing or to produce documents when required to appear before a Professional Services Review Committee. If a practitioner refuses twice to comply with the requirements of a written notice of hearing, that practitioner will be fully disqualified from the Medicare until such time as he or she agrees to comply. The inclusion of this provision reflects a view shared by the Government and the AMA that a practitioner whose conduct in the rendering or initiating of publicly funded services is open to question should be required to participate in a professionally oriented process of review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the creation of an independent Director  of Professional Services Review. The occupant of this position will be responsible for considering referrals for review from the Health Insurance Commission and deciding whether to empanel a Professional Services Review Committee from members of a Professional Services Review Panel drawn from the relevant fields of  professional practice. The Director will also have the power to dismiss a referral or to impose, but only with the consent of the practitioner who is the subject of a referral for review, a partial disqualification from Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Director, who will be in effect the manager of the entire review process, will be required to report annually to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Commission will no longer be responsible for providing the secretariat. However, the Director may make an arrangement with the Health Insurance Commission or another Commonwealth authority for officers of the authority to be made available to assist the Director in the performance of his or her duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill gives the profession substantial autonomy in examining and reaching findings on inappropriate practices. At the same time, proper care has been taken to ensure that the practitioner under review receives natural justice. At every major point in the review process the practitioner is given the opportunity to make submissions that could influence the review process and outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the separation of the three elements of the decision making processes which are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the referral for review;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the review hearings and findings; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the determination of any penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Insurance Commission prepares and refers a case for review to the Director of the Professional Services Review who decides whether to empanel a Professional Services Review Committee. The Review Committee reports on its findings and, if the findings are adverse to the practitioner under review, a Determining Officer, who must be a person holding an office or appointment under the Public Service Act, must determine one or more of the following courses of action:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a reprimand;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">counselling;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">repayment of benefits to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">payment of a penalty to the Commonwealth; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">complete or partial disqualification from the Medicare scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Determining Officer will be required to provide the practitioner under review with a draft determination on which the practitioner will have the opportunity to make submissions before it becomes final.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill retains the current appeals mechanisms, with an appeal to the Professional Services Review Tribunal, which will replace the Medical Services Review Tribunals and the Optometrical Services Review Tribunals. The new Tribunals will function in the same manner as the existing Tribunals, and there will continue to be provision for appeals on questions of law to the Federal Court.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the conditions attached to the release of funds provided under the Prime Minister's One Nation Statement of 26 February 1992 for upgrading Australia's national intercapital rail network was that the Commonwealth receive appropriate recognition of these funds as equity in the National Rail Corporation Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1998 to enable the Commonwealth to receive this recognition.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendments to the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends penalty provisions relating to actions which intentionally or recklessly endanger the safety of a train and increases the maximum penalty that may be prescribed for offences against the by-laws or regulations from $500 to $1,500. In addition, the bill also amends sections 69 and 70 of the act which require the commission to provide to the minister reports of accidents that occur on railways `operated by the commission' and provide that the minister may establish a board of inquiry to inquire into such accidents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precise scope of the phrase `railways operated by the commission' is somewhat ambiguous, particularly where the operational control and management of a railway owned by the commission may be exercised by another railway authority under a contractual arrangement such as a lease, licence or running agreement. The amendments extend the safety reporting requirements under sections 69 and 70 to cover railways `owned or operated by the commission' thus ensuring that in the event of any rail safety accident or incident occurring on any of the commission's railways the reporting and inquiry obligations will apply. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 will enable Australia to give effect to article 83 bis of the Chicago convention when it enters into force internationally. The amendments will facilitate the oversight of leased, chartered or interchanged aircraft by enabling a contracting state to enter into bilateral arrangements transferring some or all of its obligations relating to the airworthiness and safe operation of aircraft registered with it to the state in which those aircraft are based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements will permit closer and more effective oversight of the safety of such aircraft. As a corollary of these amendments, the Air Navigation Act 1920 is to amended to provide for Australian ratification of article 83 bis. The amendments will also clarify the authority's ability to properly regulate foreign registered aircraft which are employed in domestic commercial operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final set of significant amendments to the act will empower the authority to provide safety regulation and other services to other countries and agencies under contract. Such a move has the potential to be an important area of export activity for Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1991 deal with two matters&mdash;numbering and protection of the content of communications. The ability to access and use numbers for telecommunications services is an important aspect of the government's reforms in telecommunications. To this end the government transferred the responsibility for managing numbering from Telecom to Austel in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with the Telecommunications Act, Austel has produced a numbering plan which provides a framework for the allocation and administration of numbers. Within this framework, it is important that the providers of telecommunications services have the flexibility to supply innovative services and packages to meet the needs of consumers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are to remove some unintended consequences of the current act that reduce this flexibility. For instance, the amendments remove any restrictions on the further allocation of numbers by persons to whom they have been allocated and remove any doubt that carriers and other persons can charge for numbers they allocate. Accordingly, the amendments ensure that a service provider who has been allocated a number by a carrier can further allocate that number to its customer. If that customer wants a particular number&mdash;which the carrier or service provider has been allocated&mdash;because, for example, it has a memorable sequence, the carrier or service provider can charge a fee. It was always intended that the legislative reforms to telecommunications in 1991 would not prevent such charging of fees for special numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide consumer and competitive safeguards through enabling Austel to impose conditions on the use and allocation of such numbers. For example, Austel proposes to prevent fees being charged for the standard numbers allocated for the standard telephone service. It could also be used to enable customers to retain their existing telephone number, where feasible, when they elect to have another carrier provide that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such conditions will be in the form of a disallowable instrument. These amendments have been prepared in consultation with Austel's Numbering Advisory Committee, which includes the representatives of carriers, users and consumers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know that that is the question because, in the terms that Senator Gareth Evans has put the motion, I would have thought that an even vote, for example, would be lost. He has put it in negative terms and that would mean that it is still the view of the Senate that the requests be pressed. I would have thought that would logically follow. On the merits, I certainly hope that there is still a clear majority in the Senate that is determined to pursue this matter. Earlier in the day the Senate said that, in relation to excise increases on rail and maritime fuels, it is not in Australia's best interests and therefore it should not be agreed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments were part of the government's tax increases in the budget which, as far as they related to increases in fuel costs, have the effect of making Australian business less competitive or, alternatively, certainly not encouraging the growth that is necessary to provide jobs. It really is deplorable that, with a million Australians unemployed, this government would impose fuel taxes that would make Australian business even less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition argued against the whole of these fuel tax increases but we were successful only in relation to rail fuel and maritime fuel increases. That is disappointing because, as Senator Panizza so eloquently put earlier in the day, increases in the costs of road transport, for example, will have a major and detrimental effect on the competitiveness of Australian industry and business. Unfortunately, the majority of the Senate was not prepared to go in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wishes to increases taxes to cover its lies during the last election campaign. The Australian Democrats&mdash;a high tax party&mdash;invited the government to break its promises in relation to the tax cuts after the election. It is not surprising that they come in here and argue for increases in taxation, notwithstanding the detrimental effect that it has upon business and employment prospects. The Greens, to give them some credit, took a different view. They wish to make rail and shipping transport costs more competitive vis-a-vis road transport, because they feel that that is an environmentally sound direction to take. We are trying to reduce the costs on all of them. </PARA>

When we vote for or against a measure, Senator Coulter jumps up and says that the opposition is greedy. I do not know exactly what he means by that.

There are not many. Peter Walsh used to put his hand up when he was in the Senate. Those opposite should realise that one does not employ people for the fun of it. One employs people in order to produce, export and manufacture. If one does not have a profit, one just does not employ people, one puts more people on the unemployment scrap heap.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the view that this chamber should persist. The government has no mandate for what it is doing. Senator Gareth Evans regularly lectures this chamber on what he calls unprincipled behaviour on this side of the chamber, and Senator Evans is nodding his head. I wonder whether there was any greater example of unprincipled behaviour than that of Senator Evans and his colleagues in the four weeks prior to 13 March. I wonder whether anywhere in postwar history have we seen more unprincipled behaviour than when the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

No wonder there is a lot of horse laughing around this chamber every time he gets up and talks about a political principle. I put it to Senator Evans and to Senator Harradine: if Silvia Smith, who won the seat of Bass by 42 votes, had gone around in the election campaign and told the truth, that the cost of maritime fuel would in fact rise substantially, would the seat of Bass have been won by the Labor Party?

The same offer applies to Senator Schacht and to Senator McMullan. If one of the Labor senators can stand up and tell me that he or she said during the election campaign that this vast range of taxes were going to raise some $3 billion, more than the net effect of the goods and services tax, as a number of writers have pointed out&mdash;in fact, the net effect of this is worse than the GST in terms of the money raised through indirect taxes&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it possible for Senator Murphy to stand up and indicate to us whether he promised his constituents that, if they voted for him, he would have a mandate to impose an extra cost on everyone in Tasmania who purchased any goods which are imported from the mainland. Of course, he did not; no-one did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill is shabby. It is a gross broken promise. This chamber should continue to press that the increased excises, which have now come back from the other place, should be rejected. There are great matters of principle here. I regret to say that, as a result of the Australian Democrats and the Greens, the government can draw the conclusion, as this budget proceeds, by and large, amended only slightly, that it can go to the election and promise one set of tax policies and emerge some three or four months later and impose an entirely different set of policies. I think this chamber fails in its task by not continuing to press this matter. </PARA>

After the election what it had to do, knowing that there were no way the deficit was going to go down, was to come in and increase taxes. That is what the government did.

On the other side of the house we have a bunch of conviction politicians, convicted of blatant political dishonesty. The poor old true believers are being taken to the cleaners by the true deceivers. The fact is that those opposite could only get away with this treachery because of another little outfit that now seems to be dedicated to keeping the bastards dishonest. It is a particular shame that at least one of the Western Australian Greens seems to have gone a brighter shade of yellow. I would not have thought that anyone would want to see us, in any shape or form, be party to measures that are clearly designed to punish those true believers; those people who once thought the Australian Labor Party stood for something worthwhile, instead of its being a bunch of opportunists without principles.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Deputy Leader of the National Party said, it is a sad day for Australia&mdash;and everyone would have to agree with that&mdash;but it is an even sadder day for rural Australians who have to face tremendous costs now that the overall Senate has let them down so badly. From this moment there will be a $580 million tax on rural Australia. The increase on fuel alone will be $108 million. It will reduce the average farm net income by four per cent, when we all know that many farmers are already struggling to make ends meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National-Liberal party started out with great intentions to stop on-costs flowing on to rural producers and primary industry. It took its position one or two days after the budget. It has remained rock solid on that position while the Democrats and the Greens have pivoted around like wind indicators in an ever changing breeze, not knowing from one day to the next what will happen. This will put an extra 15 per cent cost on rural Australia and reduce rural incomes by four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall in Australia the cost of a trolley of groceries on average will go up by $3 to $4, but in Western Australia it will go up by $5 to $5.50. So the people who came into this place by having been piggybacked in on Liberal Party preferences have sadly let Western Australia down. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would add another dimension to this debate because it seems to me that it is a bit of a conspiracy. I am not a great believer in conspiracy theories, but we have battled away and sought to move amendments. We had the Greens with us one minute and then they dived; then the Democrats dived; and then we had them both with us and they dived. We have battled away over the last four days and all we have done is provide a forum for watching the Democrats do double-twisting somersaults and backflips. It is just a conspiracy of the Democrats, the Labor Party and the Greens working together, trying to say, `We're here to save the world; we're here to help you. I'm from the government; we're here to help you'. Then they dived, and then they came back and the Democrats dived. So it goes on and on. For four days we have not achieved one thing because they have just sold out, done deal after deal with the government, and the government has them in its pocket. </PARA>

They will be treated with contempt at the next election, and I hope that the Liberal Party considers where it puts its preferences next time. It has been a bad day for Australia, but it has been a terrible day for rural Australians who will have to wear the brunt of the conspiracy, the double-dealing and the tricks that the Democrats and the Greens have staged tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make it very clear that the Democrats now are becoming completely indistinguishable from the Labor Party. At least the Greens are showing some sort of difference; they might be naive, they might be funny, but they are different. But the Democrats now are completely the same colour and type as the Labor Party, except a little more to the Left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks on that note, but I am disappointed. I am disappointed with the Greens; I am particularly disappointed with the Democrats who will go out to those in rural Australia and say that they are supporting them, when at every stage they let them down badly. There could be no worse way to let down rural Australians than to increase the cost of fuel that they find so necessary to use out there for their production, getting their products to market and their food to the table. It is one of the unkindest things that I have ever seen the Democrats perform. I really am quite disgusted. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that today one of the Greens senators had a little badge on her lapel saying `Black on Thursdays.

Senator Faulkner clearly did not read it, because when the Greens came in to vote on that division, he went over and put the heavy on them and said, `You've got to sit on this side with us'. We are sick and tired of the intimidation from the Labor Party and this nonsense that we get from the other side.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at this bill, the request and the motion moved by Senator Gareth Evans on the request, we have to ask ourselves what the effect on the transport industry in this country will be. What will be the effect on prices in remote areas? There will be an increase in prices in remote areas such as the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Prices might be an extra 25 per cent higher as a result of the additional fuel tax that will be imposed tonight. That is what we are talking about. Every Thursday we will be wearing black. I suspect that many people in regional Australia will be wearing black because they will be mourning the death of morality on that side of the chamber. </PARA>

One of them came in and voted with the coalition&mdash;so they can say that they voted with the coalition&mdash;and the other sat outside the chamber and denied the coalition the vote it needed to keep on representing the people who live in regional Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg to disagree with Senator Harradine. I consider that the Senate has an entirely different role from that of the House of Representatives. Members of the House of Representatives are elected on a different franchise from us. We are elected state by state. Since 1 July 1993 in the Senate we have been in a unique situation with the voting strengths of the parties and the independents.

This is a unique position. Senator Harradine is telling us that this committee should not seek to reassert the decision that was made this morning. I am saying that the Senate should do that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Burns would have us believe that the Senate is purely a party house. There is no doubt that the founding fathers did envisage that the Senate would quickly form into a party based house. Those very same founding fathers recognised that senators would have big influences within their party forums. I am putting it to the Senate&mdash;and it is perhaps the first time it has been put publicly&mdash;that we now have a situation where the two major parties may well represent the party room positions, and very rarely will they differ from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very rarely will we see a Liberal or a National Party senator break from the considered, philosophically sound position that is determined in that party room&mdash;even though there may have been occasions in the last couple of years where some may have chosen to do that. Rarely will we find a Labor Party senator breaking from party ranks to vote against his party and in the interests of his state. We have seen this here, with senators from outlying states not voting to press these requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here tonight we have a very special situation in which three independent senators&mdash;two Greens from Western Australia and one Independent from Tasmania&mdash;represent outlying states that are specifically and particularly disadvantaged by the increases in taxes that this government promised we would not have but which it has brought in with this budget. Here we have a chance for the Senate to stick up for the outlying states. Senator Harradine has that opportunity, Senator Margetts has it and so does Senator Chamarette. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Harradine was correct in saying that the Greens had indicated that they would be voting to press this request. That is why some of us on the opposition benches are perplexed and incredulous at the fact that Senator Margetts abstained from the last vote. I think that was very sad. Through my colleague Senator Panizza, we offered Senator Margetts the opportunity to explain why she abstained from voting. The reality is&mdash;and I will try not to go down the irrelevant track of reflecting on former votes&mdash;that if she were to choose to abstain from the next vote on the matter we are considering in committee then, effectively, it is a vote for the Government's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very similar to the position that we put to the people of Western Australia during the 1993 election, particularly the Senate election. Some Liberal senators&mdash;and I know I did on occasions&mdash;suggested to the people of Western Australia that a vote for the Greens was indeed a vote for the Labor Party. On most occasions, in the years I have been here, the Greens do vote with the Labor party. I think the statistics show&mdash;I have not seen them lately&mdash;that on something like 92 per cent of occasions the Greens vote with the Labor Party on divisions. </PARA>

Just about every grocery item that is not imported into Western Australia goes across the Nullarbor on the railway. These measures will put up the cost of groceries and will affect Western Australians a lot more than they will affect Senators Evans's constituents in Melbourne or citizens living in Sydney or virtually any other state. The fuel imposts will have a worse impact upon Western Australia than they will on just about any other state in Australia, on my reckoning. I refer to rail and also to shipping.

It is a situation that has never previously arisen in the history of this chamber. It requires accordingly an unprecedented way to resolve it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. The minister is not entitled to move to another motion because the matter has now been resolved. The Senate has had a vote and there has to be a consequence that flows from that vote. The government chose to put its original motion in the terms `that the request not be pressed'. There was an even vote and under the terms of the constitution it should be resolved in the negative and therefore the requests should be pressed. There has to be a consequence that flows from every vote that is taken. Therefore, you should rule, as I have said, that the requests are pressed by virtue of the vote of the Senate that has just taken place. Mr Chairman, I put to you that it is the only logical conclusion on the basis of the vote of the Senate and the minister is not entitled  to  get  up and  move  another motion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation we are confronting is an unprecedented one and it demands an unprecedented approach in order to clearly identify in a way that has not been clearly identified, I would suggest so far, what precisely the will of the Senate is so far as this issue is concerned. Whatever else the equal vote that we have just got means, it clearly does not indicate that there is a majority for pressing the amendment in question. What it does mean is ambiguous. What it does mean will be much less ambiguous if the motion is put in the alternative way&mdash;in a way that makes it clear. If the motion is that the request be pressed, and that is resolved in the negative, clearly the will of the chamber is that the motion not be pressed. Putting it another way, clearly there is not, when tested in this way, a majority for the request to go forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue has been addressed in an indirect way by Odgers in the sixth edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has yet to be tested is the position which would arise if the motion that the amendments be not insisted on be negatived by an equal vote. It could hardly be deemed that the Committee had resolved that the amendments be insisted on, because the Committee was equally divided. In such circumstances, probably the Chairman would state that position and invite a motion that the amendments be insisted on.</PARA>
<PARA>Odgers is referring there to amendments not requests, but I would suggest to that extent that the analogy is perfectly apt and the advice is perfectly good. If we test the matter in the alternative way and we get an equal vote again, as is perfectly possible, because on this occasion even though I am moving that the request be pressed, the government will, of course, be voting against that resolution and there is nothing in the standing orders to inhibit that particular course being taken. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, may I put further argument to you. The basic proposition that we have to begin with is that it cannot possibly determine the fate of a particular amendment the way in which the amendment is put. The issue before the Senate is whether the request will be pressed and go back to the House of Representatives. There are two ways in which this issue can be tested under the standing order. One way it can be tested is for a motion to be put that the request be pressed. If that is an equal vote and it is negatived on the basis of equality, it is clear that the request will not be pressed. It is also very clear that there is no majority for the request to be pressed. That is what I seek to test now by putting the motion in the way that I proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the motion is put the other way&mdash;that the request not be pressed&mdash;and that is greeted with an equal vote, as it has been, what we have is a formal negativing along the lines that the request not be pressed. Two negatives do make a plus when it comes to algebra, but I suggest that when it comes to determining the validity of a Senate vote, that is an insufficient precision or an insufficiently strong foundation on which to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the key point is, if there is a tied vote, whichever way the motion is put, however else we choose to characterise it, there is not a majority of senators for the basic proposition in issue, which is that the request be pressed. However we twist and turn, juggle and weave, there is not a majority for the request being pressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate wants to do something as dramatic and important as pressing a request in circumstances that we are now confronting, there ought to be a majority for that particular course to be taken. The absence of a majority is very clear. If we put the motion in the form that the request be pressed, the absence of a majority for that proposition is rather less clear. It is rather more ambiguous, it is rather more disguised, if we simply leave it on the basis in which it has been put so far. It was for that reason that the Chairman very properly ruled that no consequence should be regarded at this stage as flowing from that first resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was proper that the matter be tested by a second resolution in the affirmative form which would produce a result which would clearly not be ambiguous but which would clearly articulate the Senate's position. It is for that reason that the Chairman's ruling and the President's confirmation of that ruling that no consequence followed from that last vote was perfectly correct. It is for that reason that the course of action that I suggest that we follow is the rational one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the course suggested in the passage of Odgers that I read out in the context of amendments, at least, if not requests. It was addressing the particular question of whether or not there is a majority to press an amendment when there is an equality of votes. It is an analogous situation. It is not exactly the same situation, but it is by far the closest passage in there to the situation we are confronting. The suggestion in Odgers is that, under those circumstances, we should put the vote again the other way. Standing order 141 clearly allows the President to do that. That is exactly what has happened, and I suggest we proceed on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. The argument of Senator Gareth Evans is really novel. He has said that this matter is of such importance that it must require a majority vote now that it has come around a second time. That is all very interesting, but it is not the case. Senator Evans chose to put his motion earlier in a particular way. The result of the vote was equal. It was negatived in terms of the constitution and a consequence must flow from that. The consequence is clearly that the requests are pressed. That is exactly what is said in Odgers. It is clearly and unambiguously spelt out there. It is no good for Senator Evans to say, `There is another part of Odgers that talks about amendments'. We are not talking about amendments; we are talking about requests; and we turn to the bible and there it is in print.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would put Odgers ahead of Senator Evans every day. Senator Evans is really saying, `Disregard Odgers because Odgers is not serving my purpose&mdash;the government's purpose'. It is as simple as that. The Senate is entitled to have a consequence flow from the vote that was taken. The only consequence that can logically flow from it is that the requests are pressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Alston" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pursue the matter briefly. What Senator Evans said in the first instance was that because his motion failed to secure a majority, no consequence then flowed. But he would then argue that if it is put in another form and we achieved precisely the same result, somehow a consequence flows from that. I would have thought it is a nil all draw either way we put it for precisely the same reason that he indicated in the first instance; that is, that the outcome cannot be dependent capriciously upon which side of the case is put first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The end result is that whichever way you approach it you end up not being able to advance the matter at this stage. The critical thing is that you are then left with the original decision of the Senate that the matter be pressed, that the request be pressed. Nothing has occurred since that time to indicate that the Senate has a contrary view. It is not as if the term of the Senate has been altered or the composition of the Senate has been altered. The Senate has made a decision by a majority view that it wanted the request pressed, and nothing has happened to alter that majority view. Nothing has happened either way. So you are left in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is critically important if we are going to take any notice of anything other than raw numbers or who represents what in this chamber, if we are to be guided by precedent. The quotation that Senator Evans referred to&mdash;we are in heated agreement on this&mdash;relates to amendments. The part of the passage he did not go on to read is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that motion too were negatived on an equal vote, it would be best if the Committee reported progress, asked leave to sit again, and gave further consideration to the matter on another day.</PARA>
<PARA>So that quotation from Odgers is in no shape or form arguing that a consequence flows from that decision. It simply says, `Put it in the too-hard basket, go away and hope that maybe the numbers change or someone else forgets not to come in at the critical moment or for some other reason something happens to bring about a different result'. That quotation makes it crystal clear that there is no consequence that flows from this other than that in respect of amendments you go away and have another think about it. Therefore, all you are left with in terms of precedent and Odgers, which is, as Senator Hill rightly said, the bible, is a clear and unambiguous statement. Mr President, I ask you in responding to please explain why that sentence is not conclusive of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A point of procedure to be noted is that&mdash;all I need to reiterate is the following&mdash;if a motion that the request be not pressed is negatived, the result is that the request be pressed. That, Mr President, is crystal clear, and it is crystal clear for the logical reason that the Senate has made its position plain by a majority view that in respect of this bill it wanted the request pressed, and nothing has happened since that time to indicate that the Senate wishes to change its mind. So the Senate's position is clear. Odgers confirms that and there is no authority to the contrary. Mr President, I cannot see how you could possibly rule against our submission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order!  I have been invited to rule on a substantive issue and I am ruling on it. At page 495 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, 6th edition, the following statement is made:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has yet to be tested is the position which would arise if the motion that the amendments be not insisted on be negatived by an equal vote. It could hardly be deemed that the Committee had resolved that the amendments be insisted on, because the Committee was equally divided. In such circumstances, probably the Chairman would state that position and invite a motion that the amendments be insisted on. If that motion too were negatived on an equal vote, it would be best if the Committee reported progress, asked leave to sit again, and gave further consideration to the matter on another day.</PARA>
<PARA>It will be noted that this passage refers to an amendment and not a request. A similar observation is not made in the work concerning requests. The passage also does not distinguish between an amendment or a request which must be carried by a majority and the omission of a clause of a bill which may be made on an equally divided vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interpretation of the Senate's vote and the suggestion made in the passage is unsatisfactory in that it leaves the fate of the bill in question undetermined and does not provide a means of resolving the situation. I consider that a more rational interpretation of the effect of the Senate's vote resolves the situation and allows the Senate to consider further the legislation in question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the initial consideration of a bill, a majority vote is required to make an amendment or a request for an amendment to the House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives declines to agree to the amendment or the request, the Senate must reconsider the matter. If on the motion to determine whether the Senate should persist with its amendment or request there is not a majority, this indicates that there is no longer a majority in favour of making the amendment or request; the amendment or request no longer has the support of a majority of the Senate. I consider that in that circumstance the amendment or request is disposed of and the bill should proceed without the amendment or request in accordance with the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation would be different if a clause of a bill had been negatived in committee, which could occur by an equally divided vote. The standing orders require that, where a bill is treated as one which the Senate can amend under section 53 of the constitution, every clause of the bill must be carried by a majority, and if a clause is negatived it is left out of a bill. If a motion not to insist on such an amendment were to be negatived by an equally divided vote, this would indicate that the clause still lacked the support of a majority and that the amendment was confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where an amendment or a request must be made by a majority in the first instance, however, a decision to persist with the amendment or request should require majority support at the later stage. This interpretation gives rise to a complexity, in that there are two categories of amendments with a different rule applying to each, but that distinction rests upon the requirement for a majority to carry an amendment in the first instance, and the requirement for a majority to carry each clause of an amendable bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this interpretation best preserves the integrity of the Senate's proceedings, and also avoids a situation of the Senate being unable to make a decision on a stage of a bill, and the fate of the bill being left undetermined. This interpretation also does not inhibit the right of the Senate to dispose of a bill which has been the subject of a request, because it is still open to the Senate to reject the bill at the third reading, which must be carried by a majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to an amendment to a bill other than the omission of a clause, if the Senate regards its passage of the bill as conditional on the amendment, this is a matter for the Senate to consider in deciding the fate of the amendment. I therefore rule that the request now in issue is disposed of and the bill must proceed without the request. </PARA>

Accordingly, under those circumstances, you could regard the matter as now disposed of and the bill able to proceed without request. A longer way of getting, I would suggest, to the same result is to say that that is the prima facie indication that has been given by the resolution that has already been passed&mdash;that there is a majority lacking for the request to be pressed&mdash;but that is better tested by having another resolution first.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have not got a ruling yet from you on that matter. Mr President, with respect, the Clerk's advice did not address that question because it was assumed that the second motion would be put first, but we have put a different question to you. And the question we have put has led us to Odgers to find out the consequence of the vote that we have already carried. The consequence of the vote that has taken place is clearly and unambiguously stated in Odgers to be that the requests be pressed. If the vote is in the negative on the motion that the requests not be pressed&mdash;which was the choice of Senator Evans; he decided to go down that path&mdash;the determination, according to Odgers, is that the requests are pressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

You have given a ruling, with respect, Mr President, on something else&mdash;a set of circumstances that have not taken place, but a set of circumstances which, if they take place, will fortuitously fall into the hands of Senator Evans because he will then say that the matter is up in the air because there are two inconsistent resolutions. But we do not have to get to two inconsistent resolutions because the vote of the Senate that has taken place has to have meaning, and the meaning is as stated in Odgers. The government has lost this one, Mr President, and you should rule on that issue. You should rule in accordance with the advice that you are given by Odgers. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your ruling does stand on its own feet as applicable to the situation as it exists now because it is clear that there is not a majority to press the request. It will be even clearer that there is not a majority to press the request if the motion is put again in the alternative form, which the chairman has already ruled is the course that is appropriate to follow by my motion being put. It will be clearer then than it is now. Under those circumstances, that is probably the sensible course to follow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it assists the matter for you, Mr President, I suggest that you indicate that what you are dealing with is anticipating the situation that would thus arise and go back and conclude the consideration of the matter that is now before the chair.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an unprecedented situation. It is not one that is addressed in Odgers. There are different ways in which a motion can be negatived and equality of votes is one of them; a clear majority is another. This situation has not arisen before. It is not the subject of any direct advice in the Odgers volume. For that reason, we do need to work creatively and sensibly together to produce a constructive and rational result which does not produce an obvious stalemate. Under those circumstances, Mr President, I suggest it is possible for you to rule and move the debate forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, what has just been put to you is this: we find the prisoner guilty; we would now like to hear the evidence. You cannot possibly go back and consider a second motion without vacating your ruling, which was clearly utterly premature, and is conceded to be so by Senator Evans in all but express terms. In other words, you have delivered a pro forma judgment which assumed that both propositions had been put, that neither had a sufficient majority and that both were therefore negatived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, it is very important that we appreciate what is before the chair. A motion that the requests be not pressed was moved by Senator Evans. It did not secure a majority. The chairman ruled that it was negatived but he then said that no consequences flowed from that. We have put to you authority from Odgers, and I wish to put further authority to you. I find it astounding, I must say, that there has been no response to this to date. Page 613 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A point of procedure to be noted is that, if a motion that the request be not pressed is negatived, the result is that the request be pressed. For example, on 20 October 1981 motion was proposed that the requests be not pressed&mdash;in connection with the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1A to 9A) 1981. The motion was negatived, 26 votes to 28.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not matter how you get there. You can get to a position by a number of roads. If the end result is that the chairman rules that the motion is negatived, then you have a clear and express ruling from a former president, Sir Harold Young, that&mdash;the question that the request be not pressed having been negatived&mdash;the result is that the Senate has resolved that the request be pressed. He did not say, `only where there is a majority'. He said `if the result is that the request be not pressed is negatived'. That is precisely the position that we have reached tonight but by another route. That is all that is different; we have got there by another way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result is one that we are in heated agreement on&mdash;the end result that the request be not pressed is that it is negatived. That was the decision of the chairman. It does not seem to have been quarrelled with. The only thing we have quarrelled with is the further interpretation that that is meaningless, that no result flows from it. We are saying&mdash;that is why we moved dissent&mdash;that that cannot possibly be right because all the authority is to the contrary. Yet what we have now is a ruling that utterly presumes events that have not occurred and that in no shape or form deals with that precise ruling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you cannot let the matter stand on the basis of a ruling that is utterly hypothetical, ignore the precise point which is before the chair and then proceed to ignore a ruling of a predecessor of yours. We therefore invite you not to do what Senator Evans invited you to do; that is, give an off-the-cuff ruling and get it wrong. We invite you to go away and consider this matter after there has been full and adequate debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is a unique situation, if this is an event without precedent in the history of the Senate, there surely deserves to be a careful consideration of the issue. We have just had a classic example of what happens if you try to do the opposite. Mr President, if you try to pretend you have listened to and heard most of what the clerk has to say and none of the debate and then proceed to read out a piece of paper which was prepared days ago on the basis of events which have not occurred, you are bound to get it wrong. That is what happened; you got it wrong. It would be unfair to this chamber, unfair to the parliament and unfair to the community for you to proceed in that fashion. You cannot possibly let your ruling stand because the ruling has nothing to do with any matter that is before the chair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you ought to vacate your present ruling, go back to the matter in issue before the chair&mdash;that is, what consequences flow from a result that the request be not pressed is negatived&mdash;and you ought to do that after careful and mature consideration based on careful reading and analysis and on advice which you take on the debate and the points that have been raised in this debate tonight.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, part of the argument has of course been canvassed, but this will enable us to complete the debate. The principle flaw is the fact that in your ruling there does not seem to have been any consequence that flowed from the previous vote. If there were a consequence, then whether or not Senator Gareth Evans is entitled to move another motion would depend on whether it is inconsistent with that consequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I do not know whether you have thought about this. I am surprised that your ruling did not address the question of the consequence of the last vote. Something has to flow from a vote of the Senate, so what is the argument? Is it Senator Evans's latest exotic argument that a negative vote that is achieved because of an equal vote is different to a negative vote that is achieved because the number of votes is different from the other?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator McMullan could participate in the debate. He might have a better argument than Senator Evans. He has not put a good one yet. With respect, Mr President, that is where the flaw was built into your ruling. Your ruling was premised on the fact that there would be another motion before you having been resolved in terms of an equal vote also. You would have had before you two negative determinations to inconsistent motions. As I said a little while ago, that is a very convenient situation for the government, but it is not what has occurred tonight. What has occurred tonight, Mr President, is that there is only one resolution before the chair and you have to determine what is the consequence that flows from that resolution on its merits. That is what we have not got from your ruling. We therefore move dissent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What you have said, Mr President, is that under standing order 141 Senator Evans is entitled to move to another motion. But he is only entitled to do that if it is not inconsistent. I am not sure he is entitled to do it anyway, but he is certainly not entitled to do it if it is inconsistent with the resolution of the Senate that has just passed. If the consequence of the resolution which has just passed is, according to Odgers, that the Senate has decided that the requests be pressed, how can Senator Evans now get up and move a motion that the requests be pressed? That matter has been dealt with and disposed of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good for me to appeal to you any more, Mr President, because you have made a ruling. So I guess I am appealing to members of the minority parties, who have been conspicuous by their absence in this debate. Are they going to allow this false interpretation to be written into the record of this place? Are they going to allow former President Young's ruling to be overruled because the President was making a ruling on a different set of circumstances from the ones that were before him? Surely the minority parties are not going to allow that to occur tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston was right. When the President realised that he was addressing a different issue, he should have been prepared to take it away and address it carefully on its merits and listen to all the arguments, including what is stated in Odgers in relation to requests, which was not included in the advice that he got from the Clerk because the Clerk's advice was on a different set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of the fact that the argument on the issue before the Senate was not properly considered that I suspect, with respect, Mr President, you have made a mistake in your ruling. You are not going to put it right. The responsibility now is for the Senate to put it right. That is the purpose of this vote. That is the reason that I have moved dissent&mdash;in order that the Senate can right the wrong that has occurred here in interpretation of the practice and standing orders of this place. It cannot be allowed to rest in its current form. So it comes back, as it should, to a determination of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, of course, gets its instructions and does not care if it is passing a ruling that is wrong, but I would like to think that the minority parties, which see themselves as having an important responsibility in this place, will ensure that the President gets it right. They have an opportunity now to do so. If the consequence of that is unfortunate for the government in terms of its numbers on that last vote, that is part of the practice. We all have to operate under the one set of standing orders. If we lose under that set of standing orders, that is too bad. They are the rules of debate. That is the basis upon which we enter these debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it will irritate Senator Evans, because he will then have to take other procedural steps and perhaps come back next week. I do not know. There are many options open to him, but that is what he has to do, because the consequence of a negatively determined vote is that it is lost. The consequence of that, as clearly stated by Odgers and reinforced by President Young, is that the requests are pressed. I invite the Senate to take the position that I have put tonight in argument and to correct the error in the ruling that you have made, Mr President. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Gareth Evans" NAMEID="VD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very quickly, very simply, the real substantial issue before the Senate is whether we are going to press these requests&mdash;whether there is a majority in this place for that particular proposition. If there were a majority for that, that would be the end of the matter. When we first debated this issue some time ago, there was a majority and there was no argument about it. Now that majority has disappeared and there is an equality of votes. So it is a difficult situation to decide how to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the motion is put in one way, as the Senate has just done, that the request not be pressed, and that is voted on in an equal way, we get the strange result that the request not be pressed; we do not get a clear demonstration of a majority sentiment prevailing that the request be pressed. That would be even more clearly revealed, of course, if the motion were put the other way around, with the vote on the motion that the request be pressed. If there is an equality there, manifestly there is no majority to proceed with the request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The short point, as I said some little time ago, is that the outcome of a matter as important as this cannot depend on the procedural oddity as to the order and sequence or the choice of the way in which the same substantive issue is actually put to the Senate. It cannot depend on a verbal quirk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I moved it the way I did is that that is the standard government motion. I did not want to be accused of playing ducks and drakes, or smart alecs, or anything of that kind. I put it that way in the expectation that the Senate would agree, as Odgers somewhere suggests, that in that sort of situation one proceeds to put the motion the other way around, as the standing orders entitle one to do, in order to test just a little bit more clearly whether there is or is not a majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point quoting that previous situation that arose that is dealt with on page 613 in Odgers where the proposition is stated that the negativing of a motion to not press a request means that the request is pressed, because in that situation there was a clear majority for the negativing of the motion in question. The votes were 26:28, with 28 senators in favour of the request not being pressed and 26 the other way around. Clearly, if the vote had been put the other way around, there would have been a very clear majority for the request actually being pressed in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that, when an equality of votes arises, where there is a degree of ambiguity, that ambiguity can be much more readily tested by putting the motion the other way. The Chairman, Senator Crichton-Browne, ruled that that is exactly what could happen. That is the ruling that has been confirmed by the President and put to us now. It is on that basis that I urge that the President's ruling be upheld and that Senator Hill's motion not be supported. </PARA>

We have had two votes on two indisputably linked bills. We already know, from an understanding of standing order 141, that either or both motions could have been moved using either wording.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had two bills where the identical wording was given by the government, which I believe was appropriate. However, when that same motion was put, each time there was a different outcome&mdash;one in which there was a clear majority and one in which there was an equality. I suggest, therefore, that it is appropriate that a second motion, of different wording, is appropriate to clarify the outcome because of the links between those two bills and the need to clarify the position of the Senate. </PARA>

That is precisely what we are dissenting from. I put to you, Mr President&mdash;I hope that Senator Chamarette will also listen&mdash;that if that ruling is upheld and you take that to its logical conclusion, we could go on and move all six of those motions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, a reading of the standing orders indicates that one makes a choice as to which is applicable to the particular set of circumstances. If there is a modification, one moves one of the modification options. If it is a request, one moves one of them. Otherwise, by saying that both can be moved, first the negative and then the positive, one is virtually recommitting the motion and the question to the vote, and they are mutually exclusive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Kemp will make a very strong constitutional point. Very simply, when the vote was taken and it was negatived, we had elected which of those motions was to be moved. Mr President, to simply rule that you can then go on selecting from that list and move all six clearly makes a nonsense of the standing order.

The reason  the drafters of the constitution decided on this clause was to protect minorities in this chamber. I put it to Senator Harradine, the Greens and the Democrats that if they agree to this ruling they will be undercutting their own authority in this chamber, because the next time a vote is negatived, people will immediately stand up and refer to Odgers and the standing orders and attempt to overturn the vote by a different motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that. But Senator Cooney understands as well as I do that the constitution provides what we can and cannot do. But the manner in which that is to be resolved is a subject of the standing orders&mdash;just as the law says what one may or may not do but the rules of court say how it must be done. That is what the standing orders are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, Senator Cooney's point is not relevant. What is relevant is to say that this Senate has previously passed a request for amendment that has not been agreed to by the House of Representatives. It is incorrect for Senator Cooney to say that the House of Representatives, not having agreed with the request, can dispose of our request. The House of Representatives does not have the power to dispose of our request; it has the power not to agree with our request. But our request must stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows also that the Senate having decided to request an amendment, that can be overturned by only a positive vote on the correct motion to overturn it or a tied or otherwise negatived vote to further press it. It was up to Senator Evans as to which motion he would move. He moved a motion that the request not be pressed. Senator Evans has made a grievous mistake because if he had moved the other motion, it might have been resolved in a different fashion, but he moved the wrong motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem then comes when we say he has to have a second chance to get the same result. Of course, that cannot occur. The matter has already been decided. In fact, Senator Kemp is correct; section 23 of the constitution is the relevant one because it states that, when the votes are equal, the question shall pass in the negative. So what Senator Evans is seeking to do is to reopen or to recommit a matter which has already been decided. It is not competent for Senator Evans to merely move another motion to recommit that matter. That matter has been decided and if Senator Evans wishes to recommit that matter, he has to follow the appropriate standing orders in relation to the recommittal of a matter to the Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to point out one other matter. If Senator Evans is now allowed to move a motion that the Senate press the request and that is resolved in the negative then, in effect, Senator Evans will be seeking to rescind a vote of the Senate. As you quite correctly said in your ruling tonight, Mr President, it is necessary to look at the substance of the decision of the Senate. It is therefore also important to look at the substance of what Senator Evans seeks to do. What he seeks to do is to overturn a matter which has just been decided by the Committee of the Whole by moving a motion of contrary effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: is that a motion which rescinds the vote of the Senate or is it some other motion? I do not believe that the only motions of recision of a vote of the Senate are motions which contain the word `rescind'. That is quite clearly wrong at law. The law requires us to look at the substance of a matter rather than merely the form. The substance of the vote which Senator Evans seeks to move is to rescind the effect of the previous vote of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I explain it in a slightly different fashion. Suppose there is a vote that the debate on a bill be adjourned and it is resolved in the negative. It is not competent for any other senator to then move a motion that the debate be not adjourned, have that resolved in the negative and, therefore, say that the debate has been effectively adjourned, because that second motion would be a motion which rescinded the first motion. That is, of course, what Senator Evans seeks to do here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the Senate decides in this dissent motion that your ruling is correct, Mr President, I foreshadow that I shall immediately be taking a point of order to determine the nature and the timing of a subsequent vote and whether Senator Evans requires seven days notice because he is seeking to move a motion rescinding an earlier vote, and whether the Senate requires a majority vote of at least half of the whole number of the Senate which, under standing order 87, is the manner in which the standing orders set out the Senate should deal with motions for the recision of a question. It says that that cannot be done except by giving seven days notice and it shall require an affirmative vote of at least half of the whole number of senators except where there is a correction of an error, in which case one day's notice is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In either case, even if your ruling is correct, Mr President, it is, of course, not competent for Senator Evans to move that motion tonight. He is required to give seven days notice and he requires an affirmative vote of half of the whole of the number of the Senate. I foreshadow that point of order if this dissent motion is not satisfactorily resolved as far as we are concerned.</PARA>

If it comes to the third reading tonight and there is an equality of votes to the proposition that the bill be read a third time, that is lost, is it not? That is negatived. That is all that that means. What does Odgers say about it? He does not say what Senator Kemp is saying about it, except in regard to the vote where there was a two majority. He virtually says, although not in these terms, `Perhaps we ought to adjourn and have a beer and somebody might change his mind'. That is what Odgers means in short.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator O'Chee</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. In the earlier debate I foreshadowed to the President that I would raise a point of order pursuant to standing order 87. My point of order is that the motion which Senator Evans now moves is a motion which seeks to rescind an earlier vote of the Committee of the Whole. It seeks to overturn that vote. I am sure those on the other side of chamber will argue that a motion of rescision must contain the word `rescind'. That is not the case. As I demonstrated earlier, if there is a motion which is resolved and one moves a contrary motion which is also resolved in the negative, what one is seeking to do is to rescind or overturn that earlier vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the motion which has been moved by Senator Evans&mdash;being a motion of rescision&mdash;is not a motion which can be moved at this point in time. A motion to rescind an earlier vote of the Senate must have seven days notice. It also requires at least half of the whole number of senators voting in its favour. Accordingly, I submit to you, Mr Chairman, that, although the Senate has decided that Senator Evans does have the power to move this motion, he is not empowered to move the motion at this point in time; he must give seven days notice. At that time it will require, pursuant to standing order 87, a vote of at least half of the whole number of senators. </PARA>

It is impossible to characterise what I am now moving as a rescision motion if it has already been accepted and endorsed that it is competent for this motion to be moved, notwithstanding that the preceding motion in 141(2)(a) has already been moved and resolved tonight. </PARA>

The first vote was negative and that should have been the end of the matter. The advice of Odgers is clear, unambiguous and straightforward. The consequence was that the requests would then be entitled to be pursued. We were never given the opportunity to have the consequence that naturally flowed from the vote that was given in the first instance. Now we have this farcical situation in which the Labor Party moves one way and votes the other way in order that it might create a situation of inconsistency so that Senator Evans can then argue that it is impossible to reach a solution. He then takes another step; there is no evidence to it. The next step is that, because there is an inconsistency, we can assume that the requests have been defeated.

That might be right, but that is not what has happened here tonight. What has happened here tonight is quite wrong and, as a result, it should be put right, even at this very late moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you will not be surprised to hear me say that I urge all honourable senators to support your ruling, not necessarily every part of it, by the way. There is an unresolved issue for another day about the impact of an equal vote to omit a clause in the case of an amendable bill. I would certainly wish to reserve my position on that and not be taken as having put that beyond doubt because there is a question as to whether bills should be dealt with in a different way. Having reserved my position on that and coming back to the particular question that is before us, it has taken us a very long time and a very circuitous route to get to where we are right now, but what we have had right now is a clear and unequivocal demonstration that there is not a majority now in this place to press the request.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reservation was not about part of the ruling. The reservation was about part of the reasoning by which the whole matter was spelt out, dealing with that part of the reasoning which dealt with the matter not before us now; namely, not a request bill but an amendable bill and not a situation where a clause was being amended but rather where it was sought to be deleted. It is just one category that is spelt out in the document and because this is a situation that might be of some seriousness in a future case, I simply reserve my and the government's position on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your ruling, Mr President, was that the requests now in issue are disposed of and that the bill must proceed without those requests. That is a ruling that I absolutely and unequivocally endorse and I urge the Senate to do likewise for the reason that it is the only rational way to proceed, short of creating an impossible stalemate and bringing the proceedings of this place into even more ridicule than is the norm outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proceedings of this place on matters as important as this, the outcomes of our procedures, cannot be made to depend on the vagaries of the particular language used in order to secure a result. The substantive matter in issue is whether or not there is a majority to press the request. That matter was left in some doubt. There was some degree of ambiguity about the way the motion was first phrased, although it was clear that there was no majority in fact for either of the side of the equation. The matter is now beyond doubt that there is no majority for that, as a result of the vote that has just been put in the way that it was in the form that the request be pressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all those reasons, because this is the only rational way, Mr President, I applaud you for having taken the trouble, in the way that you did, to consider this matter very carefully over the last few days and to take the advice of the clerk which, in this instance, on this particular matter, I think was admirably rational and balanced. We are dealing with an unprecedented situation. Although it has taken an unmercifully long time to deal with it, it is important to address in a considered, measured and thoughtful way the particular problem with which we are faced and with which we might conceivably be faced on a number of future occasions. It has been worth it to get it right. Your ruling was right and it ought to be endorsed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the motion, very briefly, moved by Senator Hill, dissenting from the ruling that is set out in these three pages. The particular paragraph that I refer to is the third to last in which, Mr President, you said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This interpretation also does not inhibit the right of the Senate to dispose of a bill which has been the subject of a request, because it is still open to the Senate to reject the bill at the third reading, which must be carried by a majority.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the Senate and, in particular, I put it to Independent senators that these two situations are not the same. If this ruling is accepted, it is not the same to negative the third reading by an equality of votes because the earlier situation of keeping a request is lost if this ruling is upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to Independent senators that if this ruling is accepted, there is a genuine loss by anyone who is forming an outcome by an equality of votes. Mr President, I do not believe that this paragraph gives any indication that the matter can still be in the hands of half the Senate by subsequently seeing the third reading of the bill negatived, because that is a different question. I return to the middle section of your ruling, Mr President, where you say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that in that circumstance the amendment or request is disposed of and the bill should proceed without the amendment or request in accordance with the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement without any precedent, without any logic. The ruling could equally have been that because the status quo is that the Senate has made a request, and there has been no majority to upset that situation, that request decided earlier by a majority of the Senate still stands. The status quo is that the Senate has put a request to the House of Representatives. Therefore, noting that that is a logical position that could be adopted by ruling, I put it to Independent senators in particular that they should dissent from this ruling and so leave themselves the option of maintaining a request. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, a moment ago in addressing the point of order that was raised by Senator Alston pursuant to standing order 144(3) you very clearly stated that a question that is not resolved in the affirmative has not been decided, and on that basis you said that it was possible for Senator Evans to move a contrary motion. In other words, you said that the first motion was not passed, therefore there was no decision, therefore standing order 144(3) did not apply, and therefore Senator Evans could move the second motion. But the second motion was not resolved in the affirmative either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it follows that we have no decision in relation to the second motion. If that is the case, then all the proceedings of the committee are a nonsense. Either we had a decision the first time around, in which case the second motion is clearly contrary to the standing orders; or there was no decision the first time, therefore there was no decision the second time, therefore the committee could not report back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems quite illogical to say that the first motion which was not resolved in the affirmative has not been decided, but the second motion which was not resolved in the affirmative has been decided. That is illogical in consistency. Therefore, I support the motion moved by Senator Hill dissenting from the ruling. A negative is always a decision. There is grave danger for the smaller parties in the Senate chamber to go down this track. What if we get to the third reading and, instead of Senator Evans moving that the bill be read a third time, he moves that the bill be not read a third time and we get a tied vote? Is that a vote in the affirmative? This is the same sort of logic. To follow your ruling, with great respect, is to turn the procedure of the chamber into a nonsense and to descend into chaos. There are logical ways to solve this, and the logic falls on this side of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to the logic of Senator O'Chee's previous statement. The first time, he said that the question was not resolved in the affirmative because there was an equality, and I agree. The rephrasing of the motion meant that it was not resolved in the affirmative either; however, it was possible to negate it. That is why when the second phrasing was used it was more appropriate and clarified the position. I believe that there is a dilemma that is caused by a confusion of grammar and democracy and I want to explain why the Greens hold the position they do in relation to Senator Hill's urging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between grammar and democracy&mdash;and both operate in these motions&mdash;is that grammar says that a double negative makes a positive while democracy says that negativity means you do not do something and a majority means that you do. Therefore, it is only appropriate that an action be taken when more people vote for it&mdash;that is, a majority. We have not gained that in either of the motions with the different phrasing. So when there is no majority, it does not happen; when there is an equality, it is negated to go with the status quo. The only status quo we have is not to act and not to insist. Therefore, the Greens will not be supporting the opposition in the position it is maintaining. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PROCEEDINGS ON BILLS: EQUALLY DIVIDED VOTES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the passage of the taxation legislation, the question arose of what would happen if there were an equally divided vote on the question in committee of the whole that a clause be now passed without requests. This question is put under standing order 140 in lieu of the normal question for amendable bills, that the clause stand as printed, because the Senate cannot leave out a clause of a non-amendable bill. The effect of negativing the question that the clause be now passed without requests is that consideration of the clause continues. This raises the possibility of the Senate being unable to proceed to the subsequent clauses of the bill. The view to which I came is that, in this situation, the Chairman of Committees should indicate to the committee that if there are no further requests to be moved the clause is passed without requests and the committee proceeds to the next clause. The rationale of this ruling would be that making a request is the only action the committee can take on the clause of a non-amendable bill. The situation did not arise and this advice was therefore not offered, but I consider that I should record it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is still the possibility of a potentially more serious problem arising during the further consideration of the bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate has made amendments and requests for amendments to the taxation legislation. It is possible that the bills will be returned from the House of Representatives with the amendments and requests disagreed to. The bills and the messages are then reconsidered in committee of the whole, and any of the following motions may be moved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the amendments be insisted on</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the amendments not be insisted on</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the requests be pressed</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.that the requests not be pressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Normally the government moves a motion that the amendments not be insisted on or that the requests not be pressed, as the occasion requires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible, the numbers being as they are in the Senate, that there will be equally divided votes on these motions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 23 of the Constitution provides that where the votes in the Senate are equally divided the question is resolved in the negative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question arises as to the effect of equally divided votes on one of these motions in relation to an amendment or a request. This situation has not arisen in the Senate in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It cannot be concluded that, if a motion that an amendment not be insisted on or that a request not be pressed is negatived by equally divided votes, this means that the amendment is insisted on or the request pressed, because, on that interpretation, the opposite result is achieved if the motions are moved in the alternative forms provided by the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two other possible interpretations:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the fate of the amendment or request, and therefore the fate of the bill, is left unresolved by such a vote, or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the amendment or request is lost and the bill proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first interpretation is suggested by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>. It is obviously unsatisfactory as it leaves the Senate potentially in a situation of being unable to make a determination in relation to a bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second interpretation is more rational, and I recommend that you rule to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of the ruling would be that an amendment or a request must be made in the first instance by a majority of the Senate, and an equally divided vote on the subsequent question would indicate that there is no longer a majority in support of the amendment or request, which is thereby disposed of. An exception would be made in relation  to an amendment by way of leaving out a clause of a bill, which can occur on an equally divided vote, and therefore an equally divided vote on the subsequent question would indicate that the clause still lacks a majority and is therefore not passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This interpretation is rational in that it rests on the requirement for majority support for an amendment or request, other than the omission of a clause, and is more satisfactory in that it avoids the situation of the Senate being unable to make a decision in relation to a bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may appear to be a complication that there are two categories of amendments with a different rule applying to each, but that distinction also rests on the principle of the requirement for a majority for an amendment in the first instance, and the requirement for majority support for each clause of an amendable bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is still open to the Senate to negative the question for the second or third reading of a bill by an equally divided vote. In the case of non-amendable bills the Senate has an opportunity to vote on the third reading after requests have been finalised; such an opportunity does not arise with amendable bills, because they are passed as amended and only the amendments are dealt with in the subsequent proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attached is a draft ruling whereby you could give effect to this interpretation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suggest that if a question that an amendment not be insisted on or that a request not be pressed is negatived by an equally divided vote in committee, the opposite motion should be moved, and if that question is also so negatived, the Chairman of Committees report to the Senate. I think that it would be desirable to have both questions put to demonstrate that the vote is not changed by the opposite question, in case there is a legal challenge to the passage of the legislation. When the Chairman reports you could then make your ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been suggestions in the press of new amendments being moved to the taxation bills in the Senate. When a bill is returned from the Senate with requests or amendments disagreed to, the proceedings are confined to the matter at issue between the Houses, and amendments unrelated to that issue cannot be moved. In the case of bills to which requests have been made, when the Senate has decided to treat such bills as non-amendable, and applied to them the procedures for non-amendable bills, it is clearly not open to the Senate to make amendments to such bills at a later stage. This principle is not affected by the declaratory resolution passed by the Senate in relation to certain bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this is a difficult and complex matter which may cause some controversy, I suggest that you consider it before the Senate next meets. If you agree with the proposed ruling, I suggest that it be provided to Senators at an appropriate time, after the bills have been returned from the House, so that Senators are not taken by surprise and have an opportunity to consider the rationale of the ruling.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ruling by Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now necessary to consider the effect of a situation in which the Senate has voted to amend a bill received from the House of Representatives, or to make a request for an amendment to the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives has declined to agree to that amendment or accede to that request, and a motion in accordance with the procedures of the Senate to determine whether the Senate should persist with its amendment or request has been negatived by an equally divided vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of such a vote cannot be held to depend upon which of the alternative methods permitted by the standing orders for determining such a matter is used, that is, a motion to insist or a motion not to insist on an amendment, or a motion to press or a motion not to press a request.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At page 495 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS>, 6th edition, the following statement is made:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has yet to be tested is the position which would arise if the motion that the amendments be not insisted on be negatived by an equal vote. It could hardly be deemed that the Committee had resolved that the amendments be insisted on, because the Committee was equally divided. In such circumstances, probably the Chairman would state that position and invite a motion that the amendments be insisted on. If that motion too were negatived on an equal vote, it would be best if the Committee reported progress, asked leave to sit again, and gave further consideration to the matter on another day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be noted that this passage refers to an amendment and not a request. A similar observation is not made in the work concerning requests. The passage also does not distinguish between an amendment or a request which must be carried by a majority and the omission of a clause of a bill which may be made on an equally divided vote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interpretation of the Senate's vote and the suggestion made in the passage is unsatisfactory in that it leaves the fate of the bill in question undetermined and does not provide a means of resolving the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that a more rational interpretation of the effect of the Senate's vote resolves the situation and allows the Senate to consider further the legislation in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the initial consideration of a bill, a majority vote is required to make an amendment or a request for an amendment to the House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives declines to agree to the amendment or the request, the Senate must reconsider the matter. If on the motion to determine whether the Senate should persist with its amendment or request there is not a majority, this indicates that there is no longer a majority in favour of making the amendment or request; the amendment or request no longer has the support of a majority of the Senate. I consider that in that circumstance the amendment or request is disposed of and the bill should proceed without the amendment or request in accordance with the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation would be different if a clause of a bill had been negatived in committee, which could occur by an equally divided vote. The standing orders require that, where a bill is treated as one which the Senate can amend under section 53 of the Constitution, every clause of the bill must be carried by a majority, and if a clause is negatived it is left out of a bill. If a motion not to insist on such an amendment were to be negatived by an equally divided vote, this would indicate that the clause still lacked the support of a majority and that the amendment was confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where an amendment or a request must be made by a majority in the first instance, however, a decision to persist with the amendment or request should require majority support at the later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This interpretation gives rise to a complexity, in that there are two categories of amendments with a different rule applying to each, but that distinction rests upon the requirement for a majority to carry an amendment in the first instance, and the requirement for a majority to carry each clause of an amendable bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that this interpretation best preserves the integrity of the Senate's proceedings, and also avoids a situation of the Senate being unable to make a decision on a stage of a bill, and the fate of the bill being left undetermined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This interpretation also does not inhibit the right of the Senate to dispose of a bill which has been the subject of a request, because it is still open to the Senate to reject the bill at the third reading, which must be carried by a majority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to an amendment to a bill other than the omission of a clause, if the Senate regards its passage of the bill as conditional on the amendment, this is a matter for the Senate to consider in deciding the fate of the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore rule that the request(s)/amendment(s) now in issue are disposed of and the bill must proceed without the request(s)/amendment(s).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PROCEEDINGS ON BILLS: EQUALLY DIVIDED VOTES PART 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further to my note of 12 October 1993, there is a further potential complication in the proceedings on the taxation bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been suggested that the government may propose further amendments in substitution for the Senate's amendments or requests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that circumstance, normally a motion is moved that the Senate does not insist on its amendment, or press its request, but agrees to the amendment made by the House of Representatives in place thereof.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this motion were to be negatived on an equally divided vote, assuming that the ruling as proposed is accepted, this would mean that the Senate would not insist on its amendment or press its request but would also disagree with the amendment made by the House of Representatives in substitution; in other words the bill would go forward in its original form (it is clear that a motion to agree to a substitute amendment made by the House of Representatives must be carried by a majority). This could well be an unintended outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The solution to this problem is that a senator could ask for the question to be divided under standing orders 84(3) and 144(2) and (7); such a request is always granted, unless the question is incapable of division. The question would then be put that the Senate does not insist on its amendment or press its request. If that question is negatived by a majority, the amendment is insisted on or the request is pressed and the second part of the question is redundant. If the question is negatived on an equally divided vote and the amendment or request, on the proposed ruling, is thereby lost, the senators can then consider their vote on the question that the substitute amendment made by the House of Representatives be agreed to. Senators who unsuccessfully voted to insist on the amendment or press the request could then vote for the amendment suggested by the House of Representatives as a second-best choice. If that second question is also negatived the Senate would have rejected the amendment proposed by the House of Representatives in substitution for its own amendment or request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators would also still have the option of voting against the third reading of the bills to which requests have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also the potential complication of substitute amendments or requests being proposed in the Senate on the return of the bills, which is permitted by standing order 141. That procedure, however, does not raise any similar difficulties of interpretation. Any such amendments or requests would require a majority to be carried.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2454" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The $65M that was misappropriated at the time of the attempted sale of the Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Limited and Regal Life Insurance Limited was recovered. The other major recovery by the Judicial Manager was a doubtful debt of $55M loaned to the Goldberg group of companies. In each case, the recovery included legal costs as well as forgone earnings on the funds. In the misappropriation case the amount collected was around $90M and in the Goldberg Loan case the recovery was also $9OM.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government is pleased that the recovery has been sufficient to provide full value for policyowners in six of the eight Statutory Funds operated by the companies. In the remaining two Statutory Funds operated by Regal Life, the recovery is expected to be between a minimum of 79% and a maximum of 87% for one and between a minimum of 94% and a maximum of 95% for the other, depending upon resolution of some outstanding matters including taxation issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Judicial Manager has negotiated the absorption of Occidental Life and Regal Life policies by Mercantile Mutual Life to provide policyowners with contracts as similar as possible to those previously held. Mercantile Mutual have also undertaken to credit special bonuses to continuing policyowners. Such a scheme provided the best possible solution for policyowners in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The arrangements, which are considered to be the most advantageous to the general interests of policyowners in accordance with the provisions of Division 9 of the Life Insurance Act (1945), are intended to provide policyowners with Mercantile Mutual policies as closely related to their Occidental or Regal policies as possible. Assessment of the "return" to policyowners requires consideration of their entitlements under the Occidental or Regal policies that have been replaced. The "returns" to policyowners vary between full cover for six of the eight Statutory Funds and from a minimum of 79% to a maximum of 87% and a minimum of 94% to a maximum of 95% for the other two, depending on resolution of outstanding matters. While policyowners did not receive investment returns for the year to 30 September 1990 they have received interest credit since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) No. Given that it was a fraud which led to the demise of these companies the eventual outcome is much better than expected. The 1991 amendments provide the Government with the ability to intervene in a proposed change in life company ownership or control of this nature. There has also been an increase in the level of supervision of life companies including introduction of on site inspections of their operations. Even so, prudential regulation cannot eliminate fraud: it can only increase the chances of early discovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The levy provided for in the Policy Holders' Protection Levies legislation has not been raised. A final decision on the levy is not possible until the resolution of the outstanding matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Because no levy has been called, no money has been collected or disbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The levy legislation only allows for the calling of a levy to provide returns to policyowners of up to 90%. In the only Statutory Fund where it would be possible to call for a levy the range of levy amounts is a maximum of $6M to less than $lm depending upon resolution of some outstanding matters including the income tax treatment of some receipts. It is unlikely that a levy will be raised, especially if the outcome is at the lower end of this range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) No. The Bills which will provide for financial assistance to trustees of superannuation funds that find difficulty in meeting benefit obligations following fraud or theft, while providing for the collection of a levy, is different in mechanics and purposes. In those circumstances, the trigger for collection of the levy is different as is the quantum of the levy which is limited to 0.05% of assets of other superannuation funds in any one year. In contrast, the Policy Holders' Protection Levies legislation related specifically to policyholders of the two named companies. It may be triggered if available assets are insufficient to provide Occidental Life and Regal Life policyowners with up to 90% of their entitlements. Further, the total aggregate levies on Life Insurance Companies had a monetary maximum upper limit of $65M; the individual company payments being calculated as the appropriate proportion of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The ISC oversight of the industry is appropriate especially following enactment of the Insurance Law Amendment Bill 1991 and the Insurance Acquisitions and Takeovers Bill 1991. These Bills have improved the financial and prudential standards which must be satisfied by life and general insurance companies and provide a mechanism for the prior screening of changes to the ownership and control of life and general insurance companies. As previously mentioned there is now a programme of on site inspections of life offices and general insurance offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These improvements to supervision of the insurance industry will afford policyowners increased protection while not overly restricting the benefits of a free and competitive industry. However, it is not possible or appropriate for the supervision to be so heavy to ensure there will never be losses to policyowners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) The arrangements negotiated by the Judicial Manager for the acceptance of all the Occidental and Regal policies by Mercantile Mutual has been assessed by experts, the ISC and the Federal Court as the most advantageous for policyowners generally. The transfer has now been effected and policyowners are free to transfer their policies elsewhere or otherwise deal with their policies as they wish and not incur termination penalties on their new Mercantile Mutual policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The policy conditions that provided for Occidental Supercache contributors to limit the level of expense charges required cross subsidies from either shareholders or other policyowners. In the circumstances it is not possible for these cross subsidies to be continued by Mercantile Mutual or other Occidental policyowners, but the extent of any disadvantage to these policyowners will in any event be small and, if future investment earnings in Mercantile Mutual are above average, there will not be any disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) Similar policies should have similar transfer values, but differences will occur if life insurance cover existed as part of the policy. Another reason for a difference might he different tax treatment for policyowners in dissimilar circumstances. The principles of the calculation of transfer values have been confirmed by the Federal Court, which has also directed that if errors in calculation have occurred, such errors are to be rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) In the normal course of events, the charges taken from the policy account pay for the ongoing administration of the policy as well as recovering the considerable costs of policy establishment which include agent commissions and related agent and policy issue costs. Theoretically the transfer to Mercantile Mutual could have been done on the basis that the policy value and the balance of unrecouped costs were transferred separately. Alternatively, a net balance could be transferred with correspondingly lower charges in the future: the net balance method was adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either approach would be expected to provide the same immediate surrender benefits and the same longer term maturity benefits after transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, transfer of separate components would have required Mercantile Mutual to change existing computer and administration systems to be able to cope with the many types of policies being transferred. It was decided that the additional costs of such a transfer to Mercantile Mutual, and eventually the policyowners, should be avoided. The commercial reality was that neither Mercantile Mutual nor any other company would accept transfers on a gross of unrecouped cost basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the immediate charges taken from policies may look unattractive in appearance the transfer value is in almost all cases no less than would have been available under the existing policy and projections show that in each future year policyowners are likely to receive at least as much from their new Mercantile Mutual policy as from their old policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As explained in 13, the calculation of the transfer value takes into account unrecouped establishment costs; however the calculation establishes the present value of each policy rather than imposing cancellation fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) There is not intended to be a penalty on the transfer, rather the calculation of a present value. Transfer of business to Mercantile Mutual was agreed to for the benefit of policyowners generally. Policyowners will shortly have control of their policies and be able to deal with them in the normal way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) Policyowners who continued to make contributions maintained their life cover, avoided new contract establishment costs and retained their tax advantages and concessions. Collectively, policyowners achieved a better result on eventual transfer of the business by maintaining their contracts than would have otherwise have been achieved. However, as normal policy conditions have applied, in some cases, policy values have been increased by less than the additional contributions made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the criticisms received by the Judicial Manager were explained to and discussed before the Federal Court. The issues were complex and many policyholders misunderstood the considerable information that was sent to them. The Judicial Manager held meetings with policyholders and responded individually to the many queries. There was considerable misunderstanding in the press. Life Insurance policies are complex and varied in type: some degree of misunderstanding, while regrettable, has to be expected. The measures that I announced on 14 July 1993 will do much to improve public understanding of life insurance policies.</PARA>
